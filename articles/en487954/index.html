Sometimes it’s not easy to force yourself to invest strength and personal time in the development of the game, when the release is not even visible, and the only engine is enthusiasm. Here, not everyone reaches the end. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Under the cut, expectations, reality and burnout indie development. And in the end - a link to the demo, you can feel how close the author was to success.</font></font><br>

My name is Adrian Novell, I am a game designer from Argentina. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2014, I started work on SkyRider &amp; the Journey to the AirCitadel for PC and consoles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cooperative project for two immediately combined action, puzzle and platformer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most likely you have not heard of him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Despite four years of development, SkyRider never came out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This happens in the industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And much more often than it might seem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost complete devastation, but I learned a lot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is my story. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, a few concept art:</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pitch</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2014, I worked for a French company that was engaged in mobile games. Then the SkyRider prototype appeared on the free Construct 2 engine. Initially, it was planned to create a game for two, in which the characters must constantly contact. At the same time, management would be simple so that one person could play for both characters at once. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am a game designer, so project management, programming and prototyping were completely new areas for me. It's great that you can share your ideas with others from the very beginning of development. As a result, I persuaded my colleagues to join my project. Some of them are still in the SkyRider team (Damian Fernandez Gomez and Roberto Andriuolo). We decided to develop the game in our free time after work. I wanted to do something really new.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In SkyRider, you control a scavenger: jump, fight and collect energy for the drone. The partner, in turn, plays for the drone: creates platforms, puts energy shields and shoots. Together you must go to AirCitadel and defeat the boss. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We wanted to make an interesting story. The Sci-Fi world was built by analogy with the real one: the rich live in flying cities, while the rest have to extract minerals from the ground to keep the Citadel in the air. Our hero and his companion robot rebel against the corrupt authorities, all game mechanics pushed off from this.</font></font><br>

Players must help each other in order to survive. They constantly interact, protect each other and work together. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We put together a team and started development on Unity, visiting all the local gamedev exhibitions that we could find and where you could connect the laptop to a power outlet. The response from the audience was overwhelming - people liked our game. When you first realize that your strange idea is actually worthwhile and others like it, you have incredible feelings. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As you remember, we started making the game in 2014 - then the high-profile indie projects </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Spelunky</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> came out </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. SkyRider was our chance to quit hiring and become independent developers.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I decided to quit my job and take the demo to the GDC in San Francisco to get funding, find a publisher, and prepare for the Kickstarter campaign for next year. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yeah.</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GDC 2015</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
GDC 2015 was incredible, despite the money spent. Moreover, the conference was a real failure, mainly due to a lack of preparation. I had no idea how to conduct business meetings, and I arrived at the GDC (in the hope of making a deal for a million, just a minute) with a laptop, two joysticks, the so-called “business plan” and a presentation in PowerPoint. The week was long. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A lot of events happen at the GDC at the same time. Those who have been there a couple of times know that business deals usually take place in less noisy places. I was carried away by shining lights and noisy events - the atmosphere was almost festive. In such a situation, it’s easy to forget why you came.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Probably, I did not approach the matter seriously enough, but in the end I still adapted. At first I wanted people to run the game on my laptop, but I realized that such an opportunity is too rare. Plus everything came out very awkward, because I had to spend time launching the game. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fortunately, we had a great teaser, and by the end of the week I just showed it on my smartphone. A 55-second video is much better than a sweating guy who has been trying to set up a demo on a laptop for ten minutes. Perhaps it would be even better to show a 30-second demo and conduct a brief presentation. Unfortunately, the first GDC did not bear much fruit, although we stepped on a couple of publishers.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A few months after the conference, life was like a roller coaster. We continued to work on SkyRider and waited for news from publishers. Some called, but it didn’t lead to anything. Each failure was experienced hard. It doesn’t matter how much we believed in ourselves, how much the local community of developers believed in us - all this depreciated when it came to business matters. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Working with a publisher comes down to business. Everything will work out if you have a clear vision of the product (we did not have it) and if you can accurately describe your needs (we could not). At that moment, the publisher was a source of funding for us. Of course, we were also ready to make certain sacrifices and cut our budget a bit.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
GDC 2015 has become an alarming bell. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">20 thousand developers from around the world in one city - this picture allows you to soberly assess the situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was an ordinary developer in the whole sea of ​​similar specialists. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, the community is great, but we needed to break out of the trap of our illusions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was a real shock. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then there was the Kickstarter campaign.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kickstarter</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In search of financial independence, we decided to </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">launch a crowdfunding campaign</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , since everyone around it was doing it. They wanted to attract the attention of the press and money in order to complete the game. Moreover, unlike the release through the publisher, we would not have to give a percentage of earnings to third parties. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we thought.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Everything turned out differently. To launch the Kickstarter campaign in 2015, we needed a US bank account and social security number. But we were in Argentina. So, it was necessary to cooperate with one of the developers with GDC and give some share.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i_/iq/ii/i_iqiiegohpv1w0rqsbr8akpfce.gif"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As I said, we were going to meet a small budget and were ready to sacrifice a little personal finances to finish the game and get at least some kind of income. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We dreamed that we would be able to work on SkyRider nine hours a day, and we would not care about thoughts about the main work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seemed that Kickstarter would provide such an opportunity. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To raise funds, you first had to find fans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the GDC has shown that there are not enough people around us, the lesson has not been learned. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communicating with the press from outside the United States was not easy, in particular because of the language barrier. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eq/bk/ae/eqbkaeyabdmd7sopkgsubrrdcve.gif"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Given all the wake-up calls, we abandoned the Kickstarter campaign. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We decided that it was enough to be distracted and completely switched to developing the game itself.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Flat</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The following months were the most fun for the whole time of working on the project (at the same time, they were the least effective). I returned to my old job and invited a new programmer to the team. We decided to rent an office, or rather, a small apartment. There the three of us worked in the evenings after the main work, four days a week. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was not easy, they almost did not sleep, but they felt energy in the air as soon as they arrived at their office. We were consumed by the desire to breathe life into SkyRider. The clouds were gathering, rejections from publishers continued to come, but we did not lose hope. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the first things we did in this office was to download the demo version on GameJolt, Newgrounds and Itch.io. The response was excellent. The youtubs picked up our title, they liked it, the necessary moral support came.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And a lot of beta testers appeared. People played for hours in SkyRider, and we watched their videos, analyzing what worked and what didn't. It became clear what needs to be completed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Exhibition dates have become our development milestones, we tried to release a new version of the game for each event. This circuit worked perfectly. There was a clear goal that helped not to get lost in the development process. Although this approach had its drawbacks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Being attached to the dates of the exhibitions, you are not working on the game, but rather collecting a demo version so that there is something to show. In this case, you have to redo the tutorial: dozens of people will launch your game in a day, the session lasts about ten minutes (and usually it is the same first ten minutes), and you want them to get the maximum fun. We have been developing learning levels for ages, remodeling them a week later, and then refining them again after a couple of days.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/1l/by/tw1lbynnmmiedlli3zfd4ck7nni.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Approaching the deadline, you start to whip up everything. The game will work at the moment, but not in the long run. By the end of 2015, SkyRider did not look very good. No, outwardly the game made a good impression, but everything was bad in the backend. The code looked confusing because we were constantly making corrections on the go. It was like plastering a broken leg over and over. And all these patches eventually began to interfere with each other, all leg animations were sent, so it was easier to take a new leg.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We had a responsible programmer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Usually it was he who noted that hard-coded solutions were the wrong way out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But there was no time to do everything right if we wanted to show something at local exhibitions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It happened because of decisions made by the producer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, the season of events ended, and we realized that it would be easier to start all over from scratch. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we did at the beginning of 2016.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only cooperative mode for two</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was decided that SkyRider will be sharpened exclusively for two players, there will be no single player. In terms of game design, we made interesting changes for both heroes - now they are more dependent on each other. But the question remained: will the game be available only from one device or are we implementing online multiplayer? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In terms of project scope and sequence, there was only one correct answer. If you don’t like the way another player placed the platform, you should be able to slap him on the head in real life. It was decided not to depart from this strategy.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tu/f-/6k/tuf-6kzmumevsxlbo3jbpzm5yaq.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We asked Matt Hammill, the creator of Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, for advice. He understood what we were going through, because our games have a similar philosophy. Matt said we need an online mode. His team decided not to do this, and that was a mistake. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After listening to him, we thought that since our games are so similar from the design side, even if their fates are the same. Gamers well received Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, which means that we should only do a “couch” cooperative mode. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stupid decision.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Burnout has begun. Developing a video game four nights a week after an exhausting day at the office is bad practice. We moved on for three evenings, and then for two. But there was still no strength. We were out of breath because we had been working on a game that hadn’t progressed so much.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another financing problem was a hard hit: at the last moment, the publisher decided not to sign a contract with us, because the game did not have an online mode. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Failure is difficult to survive even in the best of days, but when there is no strength anyway, it simply devastates. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vd/sc/dy/vdscdyi7ll3nzu7ytpirxxu_bi8.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By July 2016, we stopped renting an apartment and abandoned SkyRider &amp; the Journey to the AirCitadel. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They didn’t talk to each other for seven months. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was no anger, no offense. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We just reminded each other of the defeat, and each decided to go his own way. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2017, Nintendo announced the release of a new console.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Go to Switch</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The hybrid console, which can be played everywhere, was supposed to shelter a lot of indie projects. And joysticks are disconnected for playing together. Switch as if created for SkyRider. In general, we decided to try again, but do not rush so as not to burn out in the process. We took another programmer and in mid-2017 began to think about GDC 2018. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We gathered on the weekend, re-learning the joy of game development. For a while, everything went well. Everything was in place, the team was full of strength, especially thanks to the new developer. But our gentle schedule meant that we would take the unfinished game to the GDC. As a result, we returned from the conference without any particular results. Only a couple of useless letters.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tn/dp/j5/tndpj5--zeqd6uns1gszrexlnhc.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We applied to Nintendo. We were told that you need to register your company in the system. And here we faced the last problem: we did not have a company. And there wasn’t even a working game. And most importantly - finally there was no strength for a trip to the GDC. We are exhausted. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The irony is that the world was finally ready for SkyRider, and we were not. During all the trials, victims of free time, fundraising, hoping to switch to full-time development, everyone found a good job and did not want to sacrifice it for the project. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We always had problems with time management. And there were no tools to do what we wanted - Nintendo Switch and Steam Remote Play left too late.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This project has become a part of me. Relatives know how hard I was worried that the release did not take place, that I lost. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I do not deny that I received many important lessons and was happy working on the project. Our tiny office was filled with laughter every night. We never fulfilled our dream, although there were many pleasant minutes in pursuit of it. And I owe him all the opportunities that appeared after him. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/at/co/ki/atcokijtmli2kz6yiykiqi9h3vw.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It’s hard to teach production and management, people get it in practice. That is why many video game development projects suddenly break off. While working on SkyRider, I realized what solutions to promote, when to step back and when everything becomes uncontrollable.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not only a good idea is needed, and not only a great game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We need to find a middle ground between creativity and business, so that the project is successful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, before starting development, you need to understand the market you are trying to break into. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Making games is hard, but the reward can be very high. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not give up and turn on your head. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That's the whole story of the never-released SkyRider. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps someday the release will take place. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the meantime, you can </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">test the first five levels of the game</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></div>
