      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/486708/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the moment the need arose to save (accurately record) data, a person imprinted (or saved) on various media, with all kinds of tools, the information necessary for subsequent use. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For millennia, he knocked out drawings on the rocks and wrote down on a piece of parchment, for the purpose of subsequent use in the future (to beat the bison only in the eye).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the past millennium, information recording was widely used in the language of letters - “writing”. Writing, in turn, although it has an undeniable advantage (prevalence, relative ease of reading information and writing, etc.), but in terms of data administration does not allow full use. The best that a person could come up with for the administration of written data is a library (archive). But the library had to be supplemented with a special search tool (indexing) and data management - a file cabinet. A card file is essentially a library registry directory. It should be noted that the term library (archive) needs to understand not only the libraries we are familiar with, but also other organized and structured written data (for example, a registry office or MVD, GNS file cabinet).</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is difficult to underestimate how much the card-based data recording system has influenced state registration systems. For example, the institution of population registration in which the address of residence is the physical location of the stored data about the citizen. So, all the data of living citizens on certain streets and areas are stored in one registration department defined by the district. This is due to the fact that this method allows you to quickly find, update, calculate, generate statistical and analytical data, rather than if the information was stored in one place. For example, the passport office or tax department to which you belong stores written - physical data about your activities (tax reports or acts of civil records). Any person or government agencyat the registration address, it can easily determine in which registry office documents are stored and in which district tax administration tax returns.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The whole system of data registration was built on this foundation of card-accounting capabilities: about citizens (registry office, passport office), about economic activity (district tax service departments), about real estate (district real estate registration departments), about vehicles (registration and examination departments ), about the draftee (military commissariats), etc. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Card index accounting is forced to use state registration marks with a territorial designation (227NA69-Tver Oblast), to name different departments by territorial characteristics (Pervomaisky ROVD), forced and forced to physically move data, etc.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I propose to consider the movement of a data unit in a card file system from one card file to another. As an illustrative example, we take the process of re-registering a vehicle in the vehicle registration system when the car is sold to an individual whose registration place (registration) differs from the place of registration of the previous owner. According to the rules, the seller and the buyer must arrive at REO “A” (to which the seller belongs) to re-register the car. After signing the contract of sale and registration of the relevant documents, the new owner will receive a transit number that is valid for a limited period of time. The new owner, during the validity of the transit number, is obliged to arrive at REO “B”, to which he belongs by registration (registration).After his arrival at REO “B”, the transit number and other registration documents are seized from him and the car is registered with the new owner.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To fully understand the movement of a unit of information below, we draw an analogy of the movement of a unit of data with each stage of registration actions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Operation 1</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The seller and the buyer arrive at REO “A” for the purchase and sale of the car and contact the operator. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The operator finds a registration card in the registration card file - that is, carries out a physical data search, which takes a certain time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After finding the card, it checks for the presence of an arrest or pledge of the car (the data is recorded in the registration card of the car).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Operation 2</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The operator, after carrying out the necessary registration actions, issues transit numbers and registration documents for a limited period of time. Due to the fact that the data on the new owner must be stored in REO “B” (since the database is card index and local), the following process has been developed to transfer information from REO “A” to REO “B”. Data on the new owner and his car will be moved with him, for which he will be given transit numbers. An account card with a special mark on deregistration will remain in REO “A” as a unit of information in the history of the vehicle.In this case, deregistration means that in the REO “A” database this unit of information will become inactive and will no longer be in the physical search list of the data mentioned above (the registration card of the machine removed from the register will simply be transferred to separately from other active rings). The transmitted information itself will be displayed in the transit number and in the registration documents.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Operation 3</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The new owner who received transit numbers as a result of deregistration of the car from REO “A”, is going down to REO “B”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The name of the type of number “transit” itself indicates that the number is needed for moving data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Information is being transferred from REO “A” to REO “B”, in which the new owner acts as a data carrier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For guaranteed completion of the movement of information, transit numbers are issued for a certain period of validity, during which the new owner is required to register with REO "B". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Control over this process is assigned to the relevant state bodies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the above it follows that the enormous legal norm and human resources are involved and used to control the execution of the data movement process.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Operation 4</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After the car arrives at REO “B”, it is registered, which means recording data about the car in the REO “B” file cabinet. The operator removes transit numbers and issues new state numbers, while printing a registration card and entering it into a card file. This registration card displays all the data that was transferred from REO "B".</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This completes the process of “analogue” transfer of data from their REO “A” to REO “B”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Undoubtedly, this algorithm for the movement of information is complex and requires large expenditures both on the part of human resources and on the part of physical activity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Movable data about the car does not exceed 3 kilobytes, while the market cost of moving information using existing technologies of 1024 kilobytes is 3 soms (according to the maximum tariffs of mobile operators).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The era of application of database management systems</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The use of database management systems can dramatically simplify the processes of changing data in large arrays of registration processes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Automate and issue guaranteed results for data queries. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For a good example, let us draw an analogy with the above process of re-registering a car if the DBMS were used.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Operation 1</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The seller and the buyer arrive at REO “A” for the purchase and sale of the car and contact the operator. </font></font><s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The operator finds a registration card in the registration card file - that is, carries out a physical data search, which takes a certain time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After finding the card, it checks for the presence of an arrest or pledge of the car (the data is recorded in the registration card of the car). </font></font></s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The operator enters the vehicle data into the DBMS and receives an instant response about the presence of an arrest or a pledge.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Operation 2</font></font></h4><br>
<s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The operator, after carrying out the necessary registration actions, issues transit numbers and registration documents for a limited period of time. Due to the fact that the data on the new owner must be stored in REO “B” (since the database is card index and local), the following process has been developed to transfer information from REO “A” to REO “B”.</font></font></s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The operator enters data on the new owner in the DBMS. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This completes the re-registration process. All other operations are not relevant, as the database is centralized. The new owner does not need to receive (pay) transit numbers. To stand in line for registration of transport (production), pay for the generated application, etc. At the same time, the burden on REO employees will be reduced since the operation will no longer require a complex re-registration scheme.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, there is no need for a number of restrictions, such as the use of a regional attribute in state numbers (no regional designations will be needed, which will make it possible to register cars in any REO), records of the owner's address in registration documents, re-registration in case of a change of residence, and so on on a huge list. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The possibility of falsification of registration documents is practically excluded, since information on the vehicle is provided from the database. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The existing processes for obtaining data in government institutions are based on the capabilities of card-based accounting and data storage. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Based on the foregoing, the following main advantages of using automated information systems (AIS) can be determined:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AIS will greatly simplify and radically change the approach to registration processes.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In registration processes, it is necessary to use the principles and rules of building a DBMS.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To fully utilize the capabilities of AIS, the established registration procedure should be changed.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ample opportunities for direct system integration with other systems (for example, banking).</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Minimize human error.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reducing the time for citizens to receive information.</font></font></li>
