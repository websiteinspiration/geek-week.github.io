<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The situation with the rights to the code in the Russian Federation is quite interesting: according to the law, the developer (individual) is very, very protected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs necessary to somehow quite decently mess up to be wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the employer needs to run a lot and painstakingly with a tambourine and papers in order to get rights to the same code that is written on his own salary. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's look at what code rights laws say on both sides:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When and what rights do you have (as an individual) to the code.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How the transfer of property rights to the code to the employer is arranged.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Timlid, who did the review, is he a co-author or who?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is it possible to commit to my pet-project from a working computer during working hours?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What hemorrhoids have to go through in order to use the code correctly if you ordered it?</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Etc. </font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is code copyright?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the Civil Code, copyright is written in chapter 70. If it is very short, then the code is a computer program. According to the legal regime, it is equated with the works of science, literature and art. It is as if you wrote a story or a particularly successful verse. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The author of such a work (computer program) can only be an individual. A legal entity cannot write anything: there is always some kind of person who was the author. Or a few people if the code was written by two, three, ten. Then they are called co-authors.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Copyright arises at the time the work is created. They do not need to be registered anywhere or somehow confirmed (although, if you want, you can later register). The registry of software rights maintained by Rospatent does not solve the problem of creating a right, but evidence that you own the software rights. The data of this registry can be considered in court during proceedings about who the copyright holder is, but they will never be a 100% guarantee of your success.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The authors (or co-authors, if the team worked) have personal non-property rights and property rights. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Personal non-property - this is the right of authorship, the right to a name, the right to inviolability of a work, and the right to make it public. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They cannot be alienated in any way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any contract for the transfer of these copyrights will be declared null and void under current law. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can transfer only the property right to the software, which is otherwise called the exclusive right. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, if you have the exclusive right or received permission from the copyright holder, then you can sell software licenses.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If I transferred property (exclusive) law, then how are personal non-property realized?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose you have signed an agreement and a stack of papers (more about them later), which indicate that you have developed something on the instructions of the employer, created a work - a computer program - and immediately transfer the exclusive right to it. That is, they wrote a code, and now the employer can dispose of it. But at the same time, you retain non-property rights: you can tell everyone that you wrote this code, you can ensure that your work is signed somewhere in the program (at least in the wilds, but so that you can see it), and you can to say that if someone added their dirty bug to your beautiful code, then this is not your code. Because yours and only yours is in a completely unchanged beautiful pristine state. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What happens if someone writes a new one based on your code? About this - a little later.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The important thing is that if you suddenly want to transfer the right to a name, you cannot do this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Personal non-property rights are protected indefinitely, and the exclusive right is 70 years (plus the time until January 1 of the following year) from the moment of the death of the last co-author. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During these 70 years, when you are already dead, any person can protect your interests: he can go to court and say that your rights are violated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the attacker will be punished.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Does this mean that you can use the code in the portfolio?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, if you do not have the exclusive right to a code or licenses for such use, then you can only speak publicly that you wrote it, but not demonstrate this code itself.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is it possible to use the code without specifying the name of the author?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The right to a name means that the author may require attribution and requires this by default. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in principle, you can allow not to sign your code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In practice, this often happens when transferring a code to an employer, when transferring photos to various publications, and so on.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who are the co-authors? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is my team leader co-author?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The author is considered only the person who wrote the code with his own hand. If someone helped to create a work, but did not write, this is not the author. Only technical, consulting, material, organizational assistance does not help these contributors to become authors of the work. That is, if you were given materials for writing code (not another code, but, for example, a development environment, laptop, chair and table), if you were advised on the code or set tasks (even in great detail), but did not change anything in it, - the author is still only you. This is directly related to the review: if you gave your code to the team lead review, and he only explained to you where you are deeply wrong, then he is not the author. But if he began to make changes to the code, then he becomes a co-author. And the degree of your participation with him from a legal point of view becomes conditionally the same: it is believedthat the finished work could not have appeared without the efforts of each of you, even if the amount of work was very different. True, such a rule is valid only by default. So, if you do not like such leveling, you can conclude an agreement with the co-authors about otherwise.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important to understand that co-authorship can only be talked about when several people write the same version of the same program. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If someone changes the finished software that you already wrote earlier, then you do not become co-authors, because you are the authors of two different programs (more on this below). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, if the code for you was written not by a person, but by AI, you may have problems with recognizing any rights to such a code at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our state (and not only ours) has not yet decided unambiguously how to relate to the generated codes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let us hope that in the near future the situation will become clearer.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How is the code quantized? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If everyone wrote a separate function, and then a large application turned out, are we the authors of individual works or one general?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here everything depends on what will be recognized as a work: all together will be considered a single work or individual parts will be recognized as different software. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In practice, this depends on many things, including the task that the employer poses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most often we are talking about a complete work, that is, all the developers of the first version will eventually be co-authors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it must be borne in mind that even in this case, one of the co-authors can use the part written by him personally at his discretion, if this part has independent significance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the next software versions the situation is a bit more interesting.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What happens if someone wrote a new one based on my code?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are related rights, this is when the great composer Johann Sebastian Bach wrote music, and Ivan Pupkin performed it in a garage on skewers and a pan lid. In this case, individual Bach has the right to music, and individual Ivan has the right to an adjacent work, that is, foreign music in his unique authorial performance on skewers and a lid. But, as you understand, this is not particularly relevant to our FAQ, because we are discussing precisely software changes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If any changes are made to your code by another developer, a derivative work is obtained. To create a derivative work, you must have the exclusive right to the work that underlies, or to obtain the right to process the original work by purchasing the appropriate license. You can also freely process software in the public domain.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After making changes to the works, two become: the old and the newly created new - derivative - work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This creates one interesting feature of protecting the rights of developers, about which we will talk below.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who is the copyright holder?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The copyright holder is the one who has the exclusive right. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the author can be only an individual, then the right holder can be anyone: an individual, a legal entity, a subject of the Federation, or a country in general. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The exclusive right to a computer program is the ability to use the software and the code for it in any way imaginable. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes the copyright holder is also called the one who uses the work under license, but from the point of view of the Civil Code, the term "copyright holder" refers only to the owner of exclusive rights. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You can conclude a license agreement with the copyright holder in order to be able to use the work in some specific ways in a certain region and for a period of time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Does the existence of an employment contract mean that all my code belongs to the employer?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, an employment contract is not enough. In an employment relationship, the employer must have to prove that the employee has created the work in the framework of his labor function in order to have his exclusive right. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then begins a chain of documents that need to be drawn up for the correct transfer of exclusive rights to the employer. But even if you go through it to the end and get covered with papers according to all the rules, this does not guarantee 100% that the court will side with the employer. As well as there is no unconditional guarantee that if nothing is done at all, the court will side with the employee. The issue of proper design is a matter of reducing risks. Let's just say, in my estimation, you can be 99% sure that everything will be in order if everything is done to the end.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the presence in the employment contract of the phrase that ‚Äúthe exclusive right to official works arises from the employer‚Äù, so far gives nothing to the employer at all. </font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If there is an employment contract, where is the position indicated - programmer?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Already a little more chances, but they are still low, because it is not indicated what exactly you are doing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps you were hired to write the code for the ICS, and you wrote the code to control the video camera in the office of the chief secretary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the employer did not directly set such a task for you, then it was a hobby, not a work activity.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- OK, but an employment contract with a job plus job responsibilities?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, because it does not indicate which code and for which TK you should write. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, if you were the admin and wrote the code for some kind of automation, this does not mean at all that you should have done it: from the point of view of the law, this is like bringing a device assembled with your own hands at home and using it at work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Very simplifying, of course.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And then what is needed?</font></font></h3><br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An employment contract indicating the position.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Job description indicating that you must, among other things, create official works - computer programs. </font></font></li>
<li>   ,   - .     (   ,   ,    ),    ,     ,    .       ,   ¬´   - ¬ª,        ,   ( ),  ,   ¬´  ¬ª, . </li>
<li>   .   :       -   - ,  . </li>
<li> -,               .              . </li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would also be nice to adopt some kind of regulation in the company, in which this entire chain will be described in detail.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The more points the employer fulfills, the more likely it is that in court the computer program will be recognized as belonging to him. </font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what, all the while rushing about with papers?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We, for example, rush. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you are recommended at least for the first versions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why for the first versions?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Because I promised one interesting feature of derivative works. Remember that any (or almost any) change in the code creates a new object - a derivative work? Do you remember that for this you need to have a property right or a license with the right to process the source software? Well, if an employee dopilil or used some code in his program, and then he had friction with the employer, then the employee will have to prove that he had the right to modify the original work. If for the first time all the papers were correctly executed, then there is not much chance that he will be recognized for the right to freely use all of the following versions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is, if a company has been doing the same program for five years, then for each change (which is smaller than the release and smaller than the sprint), you need to make a set of papers with acceptance and transfer certificates and that‚Äôs all for that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regardless of whether the feature went into release or not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But sometimes they don‚Äôt bother with this after the appearance of the first finished work, because in court the developer will need to explain that he did not steal the original code.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If this is not an employment contract, but a GPC agreement?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A GPC agreement is a civil contract. As a rule, we are talking about a contract and a contract of copyright order (two in one). If your contractor is not a ‚Äúphysicist‚Äù, but an organization, then the article will be applied not about the contract of author‚Äôs order, but about the work created by order. Almost the same, but there are nuances. When you order a work from a freelancer or contractor, you need to sign a similar set of documents. True, some will have slightly different names: GPC instead of an employment contract, TK instead of a job. The job description, of course, is not needed at all, the report is also not needed. As with labor: there is no 100% guarantee that the court will take sides on one side, since there can always be some pitfalls. But you can reduce your risks to almost zero.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With obtaining rights from the contractor, there is one more important point: you need to make sure that the contractor himself has obtained the rights from his employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, ideally, you need to request the entire set of documents from the list above. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is likely that they will not be presented to you just like that, so it will not hurt to spell out the contractor‚Äôs corresponding duty in the contract at the time of conclusion. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the contractor did not formalize the transfer of rights from the workers to himself, then he cannot transfer these rights to you (since he did not have them). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can continue to sue him for losses, but you will not get the rights to the code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This can be revealed at any time during the life of the developer and another 70+ years.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If I work in the company from 10:00 to 18:00, and write an open source project at home, where are what rights?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everything that is not related to the job assignment is yours. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let me remind you that according to the law, the developer almost does not need to prove his rights to the work, on the contrary, the employer needs to prove the correct transfer of rights from the employee. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the described situation, most likely, the rights to official works are somehow formalized, therefore at work you make a code for transferring property rights to the employer, and at home - your own.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If I do this on a working computer?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In most cases, it doesn‚Äôt matter what and where you did. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can commit in the open source during working hours from a working computer, you can write your own projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the employer did not set such a task for you, questions about the rights to the code will not arise. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There will be questions about what you do during working hours. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But evacuation from official duties (and this is it) does not create the right to what was done during this evacuation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I also heard about such a legal life hack: employers prescribe that storing the code on the workstation, which is the property of the employer, is equivalent to accepting the transfer of rights to this code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, in my opinion, its effectiveness raises questions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If I transferred exclusive property rights to public use, can I create a derivative work?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, you certainly can. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the possibility of free transfer of their software to the public domain under Russian law is at least controversial.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, I have more questions ...</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ask questions in the comments or email earkhipov@croc.ru. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Separately, I note that we often see "victims of digitalization" to whom contractors incorrectly transmit the code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in the post of my colleague</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> there are several life examples of what size the damage can be.</font></font></div>
