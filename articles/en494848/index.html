<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today I want to share with you a very beautiful and interesting, in my opinion, article that was being prepared for the beautiful holiday of March 8th. It is worth noting that in the social. She went very well online and was appreciated by readers. I am sure that here it can be of interest to many. I‚Äôm sorry to publish it late, I just haven‚Äôt been registered here on such a pleasant and interesting resource. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, interesting reading, friends! </font></font><br>

It is no secret that women have fought for equal rights with men and must still fight for them. History is a wonderful reminder of how far women have come in this matter. But in truth, women got most of their rights only in the 20th century. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the world of astronomy, the same thing happened. In the early years of astronomical discoveries, women mainly worked as assistants to men, who, in turn, took the lead in scientific work and projects. In fact, women were not even allowed to operate telescopes until the first few years of the 20th century. And this state of affairs was accepted as the norm. In this article, the reader is invited to learn about how the role of women in astronomy of the 20th century developed, as well as about their greatest achievements in astrophysics.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The following is a list of fifteen exemplary female astronomers whose contribution to this field of science, whether it is the search for a new planet, an asteroid, or the discovery of new astronomical phenomena, far exceeds their honor.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Caroline Herschel</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The German astronomer and sister (and assistant) of the astronomer who discovered Uranus - William Herschel - Caroline - the first woman to discover a comet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For all the years of her work, she discovered seven comets under her name, including the periodic comet 35P / Herschel-Rigollet. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Caroline Herschel is also known for being the first astronomer to catalog stars and nebulae. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Throughout her career, she was able to discover 14 nebulae, one of which is the Monsieur 110 nebula. Together with Mary Somerville, she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1835; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">they were the first two women in history to hold such a position. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In subsequent years, she also received many awards, including the King of Prussia Gold Medal for achievements in science.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Henrietta Swan Leavitt</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An American astronomer, born in 1868, first began work on a project to determine the brightness of variable stars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This paved the way for her to discover the relationship between the period and the brightness of the variable Cepheid stars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This discovery was used (and is still used) by astronomers to accurately measure cosmic distance, known as the dependence of luminosity on the period.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Jocelyn Bell Burnell</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Born in 1943 in Northern Ireland. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She began her career as a scientific assistant to the astronomer Anthony Hewis. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jocelyn Bell Burnell took an important role in creating a huge (81.5 megahertz) radio telescope, which was subsequently used to track quasars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jocelyn Bell is credited with the discovery of pulsars confirming the existence of rapidly rotating neutron stars. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2018, she was awarded the special prize "For a breakthrough in fundamental physics", amounting to $ 3 million. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the award ceremony, she donated the entire amount to help refugee students become physics researchers.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Ruby Payne-Scott</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ruby Payne-Scott was considered the world's first woman radio astronomer, and her astronomical career has always been fraught with great difficulties. Payne Scott was born in 1912 in New South Wales, Australia. With age, she showed great interest in mathematics and botany. After graduating from high school, she was able to win a couple of scholarships at the University of Sydney, where she studied the logic of mathematics, the chemical compositions of substances, the secrets of botany and the laws of physics.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After graduating from university, she continued to work in the research organization of the Australian Union for Scientific and Industrial Research, where she later focused on solar radio astronomy and discovered types I and III bursts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She also played an important role in detecting type II and type IV explosions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No matter how successful her career was, she was forced to save her marriage to Bill Hall, whom she married in 1944. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5 years later, when she finally left the agency, she gave birth to her first child, and also changed her last name and became Ruby Hall.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Eleanor Helin</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Eleanor Globe Helin was an American astronomer who is known for her discovery (and joint discovery) of about 872 asteroids. Known for its discoveries are the asteroids Aten, 2062 Aten and 2100 Ra-Shalom. She was also the lady who discovered the Apollo group of asteroids: 4660 Nereus and 4769 Castalia. In addition, she also participated in the discovery of several comets, one of which is 111P / Helin-Roman-Crockett. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For more than 30 years, she has been actively involved in planetology and astronomy, in the jet engine laboratory and California Institute of Technology, where she launched a program called ‚ÄúStudy of the intersection of planets with Palomar‚Äôs asteroids‚Äù (PCAS). The program has become the key to the discovery of several unique asteroids and comets around the world. Asteroid 3267 "Globe", crossing Mars, was named after her.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. Carolyn Shoemaker</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Carolyn Shoemaker is an American astronomer who discovered more than 30 comets and hundreds of asteroids. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Born in 1929, studied at the Faculty of History, Political Science and English Literature. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then she married Eugene Shoemaker, a geologist who also became interested in astronomy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After college, she worked as a teacher in high school for a year, after which she left work to raise three children. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only after her children grew up and left the house, she found time to help her husband in the search for comets and asteroids.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was during this time that she also worked as a professor of astronomy at the University of Northern Arizona. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was in 1993 that Carolyn, husband Eugene and comet hunter David Levy, discovered a comet that later became known as Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. It is known that pieces of the comet collided with the planet Jupiter in 1994, staging a spectacular show, sensational among astronomers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For all of her services in this field of science, Carolyn received many awards, including the James Craig Watson Medal in 1998 and the Scientist of the Year Award in 1995.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. Maria Mitchell</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
American astronomer Maria Mitchell was born in 1818 in the United States. Known as the first professional female astronomer. Maria‚Äôs interest in astronomy came under the influence of her father, who instructed her to evaluate the timepieces for the Nantucket whaling fleet. At a time when women were not always able to conduct observations using telescopes, Mary was given the freedom to use and operate it. She was educated in Massachusetts and immediately after college worked as a librarian (and teacher) in the daytime, and at night she continued to observe the sky. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
She later became the first woman elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Her significant research took place in 1847, when she first established the orbit of a new comet, which was later known as Miss Mitchell's comet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After such a discovery, Danish King Frederick VI presented her with a gold medal - an award that was considered noteworthy for a woman in those days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She was also a pioneer in the daily photography of sunspots, which at that time were considered sunny clouds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was this that led to the discovery that sunspots form on the surface of the Sun, and not in its atmosphere, in the form of clouds.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10. Vera Florence Cooper Rubin</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
American astronomer Vera Rubin was born in 1928 in Philadelphia, PA. It is known that she was a pioneer in the work related to the frequency of rotation of galaxies. She made the greatest contribution to astronomy by studying the rotation curves of the galaxy. She was able to detect the difference between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the observed motion. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Vera also contributed to astronomy, a work proving the existence of a huge amount of dark matter in space.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although most of her career was difficult because she was a woman, she was the first woman to be allowed to use the Hubble telescope in the 90s. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It should also be noted that throughout her career she was very frank and always fought for gender equality in science. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1993, she was awarded the National Science Medal for all her scientific achievements in astronomy.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">11. Carolyn Porco</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
American astronomer Carolyn Porco was born in 1953 and is known for her knowledge of rings and satellites orbiting planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She is also known for her exploration of the same planets that began in the 1980s with the help of the Voyager spacecraft. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
She also leads the visualization team for the Cassini mission, which is currently in orbit on the planet Saturn. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Until now, its greatest discovery has been giant geysers of ice particles on the sixth largest satellite of the planet Saturn. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This discovery indicates that there is water on the planet.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">12. Nancy Grace Roman</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
American astronomer Nancy Roman was born in 1925 and began to study astronomy quite early. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Long before women dared to dream of doing science, at the age of 11 she began to organize an astronomy club and became one of the best in this field. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After receiving her doctorate in astronomy from the University of Chicago, Roman became the first head of NASA's astronomy department. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She was also the first woman to hold leadership positions in this organization. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Her main achievement was her participation in the planning and development of orbiting telescopes, including the famous Hubble telescope. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In subsequent years, she was called the ‚ÄúHubble Mother‚Äù for this contribution.</font></font><br>
<br>

<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">14. Debra Ann Fisher</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Debra Ann Fisher was born in 1953, later becoming a star researcher at Yale University. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She and her team were able to discover many planets outside our solar system that revolve around other stars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Debra discovered the first exoplanet, she had just finished graduate school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In her search for other worlds, she was also able to find similarities between our own and other planetary systems. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One such example is that other planetary systems also contain several planets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over the years, she was also able to meet unique finds, one of which is a planet located in a binary star system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He teaches astronomy at Yale University, and is also engaged in research on the detection of exoplanets.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">15. Jill Tarter</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When a person grows, thoughts of the loneliness of mankind arise on his life path. From the very beginning of its existence, people have always been wondering if other life forms exist outside of our world. And while everyone was busy with their own affairs, Jill Tarter began to act and made the search for extraterrestrial life his career for life. She was director of the SETI Research Center; SETI is short for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although she had already retired without being able to contact anyone outside of our planet, her research for many decades helped current astronomers and scientists to continue this search for a possible life outside our planet.</font></font><br>
<br>

And taking advantage of the fact that it's still March in the yard, I hasten to congratulate the beautiful half of the Habr resource on the past spring holiday! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I wish you good health, universal happiness, bright fun, endless luck and cosmic love! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Always shine, because in all of us there is a particle of stellar matter, but in you there is a little more! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it is she, a piece of stars, that makes you so beautiful and irresistible! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">May it always shine from you, never fading, endowing everyone around you with your warmth and joy! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since March 8, lovely women and girls, albeit somewhat late! </font></font><br>
