<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis will end in the foreseeable future, and software and digital companies will rush to conquer foreign markets with renewed vigor. And at the same time, the need for localization, including language, will increase. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Analysts are confident that in the next two years we will expect a serious increase in the number of export-oriented IT companies, with the share of foreign sales in the total turnover not lower than 60%. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2019, compared with the previous year, the volume of foreign sales of software and services for its development by Russian companies grew by 15% and reached $ 11.3 billion, and service companies continued to maintain their positions in the ranking of 100 leading service companies in the world.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For us - EGO Translating Group of Companies - this issue is of great interest, because, on the one hand, we are a developer of specialized IT solutions in the field of linguistics and natural language processing (Natural Language Processing) under the EGOTECH brand, and on the other hand, one of the areas business is associated with the provision of language localization services (brand EGO loc).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before proceeding to the consideration of relevant models of language localization, let's clarify what localization includes: translation and transcription of textual information; adaptation of graphic elements, currency symbols, date format, addresses and phone numbers, choice of colors and many other details, including a review of the physical structure of the product. All these changes are carried out in order to avoid possible conflicts with the local culture and population and to penetrate the local market, adapting to local needs. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to optimally build the localization process for the target audience of foreign markets? What models and formats are more efficient today? What are the main difficulties of localization? What mistakes should novice exporters avoid while introducing the product to foreign markets?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With these questions, we turned to representatives of export-oriented companies - leaders of various areas of the IT industry and digital communications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We asked the participants in our interview to talk about the main export markets in which they operate and how the localization process is built. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ilya Blair</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , Deputy CEO for Software Development </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First Line Software</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> :</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our main development center is located in St. Petersburg, and offices are also located in Nizhny Novgorod, Moscow, the Czech Republic (Prague, Brno) and the Netherlands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have many customers in the USA, Europe and Russia, but this is not limited to geography. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For Australia, we are conducting a major medical project, we are trying to conquer Africa.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Ilya noted that often in the projects of Russian commercial customers (non-state projects) localization is initially present, with the aim that users of solutions can be outside of Russia.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Given the customers' use of their product on the international market, we often create and coordinate the product in English, very often the customer already provides the specification in English. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the English version is ready, we issue resource files for translation, where the English term is already associated with the national (local) one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resource file - a file with all the terms that are present on the screen: the name of the buttons, menu items, error messages, tooltips. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The client checks this file. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For us there is no technical problem to realize multilingualism.</font></font></blockquote><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ekaterina Zabelinskaya</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , director of business development in international markets </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Reksoft"</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (the company specializes in custom software development for large customers).</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our main countries of presence: Russia, USA, Germany, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reksoft has been working with international customers for almost 30 years, including in the development of products that require localization not only in English, German, etc., but also in relatively rare languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as Portuguese and Chinese.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She gave an example of a localization project for the Artipic graphics package. The project was initially developed in English, then adapted and translated into localization languages, including Russian. For localization, local specialized specialists were employed in each language, working directly in the field of graphic design and photography.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In one country, Rexoft employees specially trained local translators to work with Photoshop so that they were as immersed in the project terminology as possible. At first the product manual was translated, in parallel there was a translation of the keyword tables. With a slight shift, work was underway to translate the product‚Äôs functionality with all screenshots from English into the localization language. After the translation, work was done on loading text with simultaneous editing of screens, since different languages ‚Äã‚Äãrequire different spaces for the required text. Further, the product was tested internally by specific translators on specific user cases and tasks. After making the changes, testing was conducted on a limited group of users. This was the second ‚Äúpilot‚Äù test for future consumers.Reports were received from them in two directions - wishes for finalizing the product functionality and comments on linguistic translation. After making all the changes, the product was released to the appropriate market.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Julia Alexandrova</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , Head of Localization and Copywriting at </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">JetBrains</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , works in the Munich office of the company (JetBrains is a manufacturer of professional software development tools, including the Kotlin programming language).</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our products are used by programmers in 213 countries and territories around the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When choosing languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor localization, we are guided by the needs of the markets of our products, the importance of languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the world, the requests of our users, and pay attention to the plugins for localization of our products created by communities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The need to contact the client in his language certainly exists.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The expert also noted that recently there was an opinion that developers all over the world speak English, and therefore there is no need to localize products for programmers. However, now the barriers to entry into the profession are reduced, you can become a programmer by completing courses, the level of knowledge of English can be very different. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The localization and copywriting team at JetBrains is one and a half years old. During this time, localization processes for marketing tools (website, newsletters, etc.), as well as interfaces of a number of products, were introduced. Now, when creating code, developers think about internationalization, interface elements are taken out to separate resource files and localized.</font></font><br>
<blockquote>      ,      ,     .        ,        .      :   ,        ,    .    8   : , , , ,  ( ), , ,  ().    ,     IT-  .       Crowdin Translation Management System (TMS).</blockquote> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mikhail Kovshov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , founder of </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">CITYLIFE</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (CITYLIFE is an ecosystem for life and business, a range of services that help people make profitable purchases, and companies to attract new customers). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mikhail noted that the topic of localization became popular one and a half years ago, when the first foreign company owners began to use the brand‚Äôs products, although the companies themselves were located in Russia. Currently, localization is carried out in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof 8 countries: Armenia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan. The three leaders are Kazakhstan, Armenia, Germany. Service (marketplace) implies working with dynamic content. The localization model is based on the fact that a business partner independently conducts its content on the site.</font></font><br>
<blockquote>    -:                 ,        .       ,   ,      ,        .            ,    .</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, CITYLIFE is now launching its own messenger (https://citytok.one/) with a pronounced theme of localization. Inside the messenger there is a core of artificial intelligence that adaptively translates the user's message into 20 languages. Moreover, the core is self-learning: it supplements itself and even writes slang. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Olga Petrova, CEO of Traffic Isobar</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (a full-service digital agency, part of the Dentsu Aegis Network Russia communication group and is part of the Isobar global network - the largest international digital marketing network that unites over 100 agencies in 39 countries of the world).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Olga noted that the specifics of the Russian clients of the agency is that they most often go to the former CIS countries and to those who speak Russian. Therefore, half of the content is in Russian, half in the native language of the target country. Also, requests come from Russian representative offices of global international clients or from global international advertising agencies for the localization of sites, client applications, and content for social networks in Russia.</font></font><br>
<blockquote> 99 %      . ,     ,      .        ,  ,         .     .       .   ,  ,       ,         .</blockquote><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are the main difficulties in implementing localization? What is the principle of searching for artists? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ilya Blair (First Line Software)</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> noted several points that need special attention: </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
1. The need for translation without taking the context off. Even if translators understand the field of IT, a poor-quality translation can often be obtained in terms of professional logic. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, a phased localization chain is as follows: the work of a translator, who is necessarily versed in IT; proofreading by a native speaker; additional verification and, if necessary, final adjustment (replacement of some terms) by the development team.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
2. Not complexity, but rather a feature that we, as a company with many years of experience in Agile, have long been accustomed to, are situations where you need to make the solution itself and its localization in parallel. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the work is done in agile mode: there is a layout / design of the interface in English, and when localizing it is necessary to focus on the design. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
3. Of course, there is a specific development of mobile applications.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the web, we can make a small button where, when you hover over it with a mouse, a tooltip pops up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not the case in the mobile application, and we try to use icons, infographics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quite often, when opening a mobile application, there are several pages of instructions with textual explanations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not directly related to the translation, but this is an approach to make life easier for the user.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Also, according to the expert, as a whole, the main focus in localization is on the English language, localization into other languages, at least European ones, is often not in the first priority, since English is still the main language of international communication. </font></font><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is always a specific release date, and developers focus on the main thing, on what release cannot be without. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later in subsequent releases, they will solve problems of the next priority, as well as respond to user reactions and requests.</font></font></blockquote> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ekaterina Zabelinskaya (Reksoft)</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> believes that the main difficulty is associated with the creation of a pool of specialized specialists for the product translation scheme adopted by Reksoft. The second is localization into some languages, for example, the localization of a graphic package into Brazilian Portuguese, since there are no specialized terms used in image processing programs in this language. This is due to the fact that such products in Portuguese do not exist; in a professional environment, local designers use versions of programs in English or French. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Julia Alexandrova (JetBrains)</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">explained that JetBrains has several translators on staff. In addition, the translation company collaborates with various vendors and freelancers. To select vendors and freelancers, a standard testing procedure has been launched: a test task is issued, the results are evaluated by internal experts. Based on the test results, a decision is made. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, last year, JetBrains announced the possibility for users to add languages ‚Äã‚Äãand participate in the translation of the YouTrack bug tracker interface and received quite an active response from the community. Users connect to an open project and localize the product. All translations are edited and approved by company experts. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mikhail Kovshov (CITYLIFE)</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">considers it extremely important to create an effective localization model based on the characteristics of the business: selecting reliable partners and creating a high-quality web resource suitable for localizing.</font></font><br>
<blockquote>      ,   ,      ,  ,     ,   : , .  ,        , ‚Äì  -,       .     ,            ,      .        ,     .                 ,            .   ‚Äì  , .    .</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The founder of CITYLIFE advises everyone who plans to enter the international market, first of all, to make their web resource on a ready-made engine specifically for localization purposes. </font></font><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On a samopisny site it is inconvenient to edit, manage, or change some things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The production of the product is completely stopped, budgets for each language are incredibly increased, there are a huge number of errors, you have to translate the same text 10-15 times. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It all frustrates and takes a lot of energy.</font></font></blockquote> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Olga Petrova (Traffic Isobar)</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> emphasized that the issue of global intercultural differences, especially with visual materials, is quite acute.</font></font><blockquote>,       ,         ,       .        .            ,          .</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Olga noted that Traffic Isobar cooperates with a pool of trusted professional agencies in the field of translation and localization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Traffic Isobar does not hold tenders, since the price level of plus / minus is the same for all performers, it is rather about terms that are ‚Äúthe day before yesterday‚Äù, as in any advertising business. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To be continued. </font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the next part, you will learn about whether terminology databases are maintained in companies and whether translation memory is being cleaned, and what the choice of the localization model itself depends on.</font></font></div>
