<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f0/9fb/025/7f09fb025a232a6d30f4a0b5e4733fea.jpg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first thing you see on your phone is an image of a stylized pipette. The rubber bulb at the top with a slight light flare forms the letter I in the word SPECIMEN [pattern]. You watch how a small colored droplet with acceleration flies through the tube and forms a large droplet with the inscription PLAY. Click - and you will find yourself in a game, as a result of which scientists, perhaps, will be able to better understand how people perceive colors, and change the display of images on the screens of all electronic devices.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a game, Specimen is quite minimalistic. The screen shows a dark Petri dish in which several droplet-like “samples” move. Players must select a pattern that matches exactly the hue, saturation, and lightness with the background color. If you choose the wrong sample or do not have time to do it, as time goes on - and the drop will die. Choose the right one - the drop will explode like a balloon at a party, and you will hear a funny sound.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the first few rounds, everything is pretty simple. It may happen that the background will be greenish-yellow, and in the cup there will be only one sample of a similar yellow-green color. Touched. Exploded. Everything is simple. But after a few rounds, complete chaos begins: the samples multiply, the timer accelerates, and you need to choose the right shade of reddish blue, hiding among the eggplant, violet, amethyst and plum flowers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is a game for color lovers: annoying, interesting and exciting. This, of course, was important for the creators of the game, Erica Gorochau, Sal Randazzo and Charlie Whitney - you want people to play your game - but they had different motives.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Gorochau and Randazzo came up with the idea of ​​the game in 2014 (and Whitney gathered the team a few months later) when Gorochau worked at New Inc, a Manhattan incubator at the intersection of art, design and technology. Randazzo then recently returned from an annual academic vacation in Italy, and decided to abandon the development of graphics for film and animation in favor of programming. He became a leading programmer, wrote code, and decided what data to collect and how. Whitney, an artist and programmer, was invited to work on visual mechanics, in particular on how droplets should move in a Petri dish. It was a difficult task for the designer. “They look like jelly and have a certain viscosity,” Randazzo explains. “I still don't know how Charlie managed to do this.” Gorochau was responsible for the design and concept, and also played the role of the project manager, and monitoredso that he went according to plan, and managed to get out in July next year.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Their main idea was to create a minimalistic game that would appeal to people similar to themselves: designers with experience in graphics and visual effects. “It's scary to realize,” Gorochau told me on the phone, calling from Brooklyn, “that it could be anything.”</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/844/f03/907/844f03907e0ae5f39648116fc4114392.jpg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Specimen is dedicated to color, because designers are often obsessed with it - but also because Gorochau remembered one of the Radiolab podcasts, and she could not stop thinking about it. She learned that our ability to perceive color depends on the photosensitive cones in our eyes that respond to light with different wavelengths from the visible spectrum. Most people are trichromats, that is, they have three types of cones, which allows them to see about a million flowers. At the same time, about 8% of men and 0.5% of women are color blind, that is, usually only two types of cones work for them. A very small group of women have a genetic mutation due to which they have a fourth type of cone. They are called </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tetrachromats.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, and they, theoretically, are able to see 100 million colors, and such intermediate shades that are available to them between the main colors of the rainbow, we can not even imagine. However, all the fun begins when the information received from these cells is processed in the brain - when vision passes into perception.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Gorochau hoped that the data collected by the Specimen game would somehow help establish the boundaries of human perception of color. But how exactly was unclear. What kind of data do you need to collect? The team did not know this, and did not think to ask for help from scientists working in this field. Most of the work was based on conjecture. Randazzo, who was responsible for collecting data in the program, was inclined to believe that it is better to collect more than less. “I thought that since the tracking platform doesn’t take money for analytics, and we don’t pay for the amount of data stored, it will take us five minutes to add the procedure for collecting it - so let's collect everything,” he says.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They settled on the Specimen option for iOS, which recorded the RGB value (how many red, green, and blue colors are in the composition) for the correct and incorrect user choices, as well as other data anonymized - including the player’s country. They decided not to collect information by age and gender, as this would require asking the player’s consent, and they thought that was wrong. “We did not want to create the impression that we were peeping at users,” says Gorochau. Perhaps the most useful data was the game’s recorded </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">LAB color</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> values</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">selected by users. This is something like the coordinates on a color map, and thanks to them you can accurately measure how much the user made a mistake. It is as if you knew that a person was trying to get to Paris, but ended up in Reims or Kuala Lumpur. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When playing, people themselves, without suspecting it, allowed scientists to understand how well a person distinguishes shades of flowers. Gorochau considers Specimen a bit of a Trojan horse with a plus sign: “an enticing game with smart stuffing.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The game was released on time, in July 2015. It was on the front pages of application stores in different countries, and in the first week it was downloaded by 100,000 people. It was not supposed to be a hit, but since then more than 290,000 people have played it 1.5 million times, made about 60 million clicks and transmitted related information.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A few days after the launch of Gorochau, Randazzo and Whitney realized that they were witnessing the formation of a deep and rapidly growing ocean of color perception data - and that they clearly could not cope with the sorting, analysis and understanding of these data on their own. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Philip Stanley-Marbel</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Philip Stanley-Marbel, a little shy and friendly man in his 40s, is an associate professor at Cambridge University. Thin, wearing amber-framed round glasses, he works in the office of the Department of Electrical Engineering, which looks exactly as you imagine it. Shelves littered with books; scattered on the table are tool kits, coils of wire, and nail-sized circuit packs stored in glass vials. On the wall is a printout of Unicode characters on parchment-colored paper. Stanley-Marbel often smiles and speaks with leisurely accuracy - often returning back to correct or clarify what has been said - which gives the impression that you and he are on different intellectual levels. It is as if you are putting on safety glasses and starting an electric saw; he is wielding a diamond-tipped scalpel at this time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Stanley-Marbel traveled the world - Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ghana and North America. His accent cannot be identified. When I ask him about this, he replies that he prefers not to reveal his origin. “I feel out of place everywhere,” he jokes. Most of his career, he was engaged in science, but also worked in industrial companies. From 2008 to 2012, he worked in Zurich for IBM, and then moved to Cupertino, California, where until 2014 he worked for Apple. He does not have the right to talk in detail about his work there, but is trying to hint. “The operating system is under applications and above hardware,” he says. “And I was part of a team that worked on various issues under the applications and directly on the hardware.” Now he is more interested in screens.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Organic LEDs (organic light-emitting diodes, OLED) in an increased size look bewitching. Each square millimeter of the image that you see on the screen consists of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">pixels</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , each of which in turn is composed of subpixels. It is these subpixels - a mosaic of luminous figures of red, green and blue (RGB) - that give all the shades that you see on the digital display. When Stanley-Marbel puts his phone with a photograph of a grimacing baboon on the screen under a microscope, we seem to get to the dance floor from the musical based on the movie “ </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tron</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“. Repeating sequences - a vertical red line, two green dots flattened together, a short blue lollipop - go in orderly luminous rows along a black background. Different manufacturers prefer a different arrangement of subpixels. We are learning another phone, and the forms are changing. Here, the subpixels are further apart, look more square, and the blue ones are almost twice as green.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The physical components of the screen and the arrangement of subpixels may seem abstract, but all of this is involved in creating the interface through which we enter the digital world. The color represents the buttons that we click in banking applications and forms the font used in headings and comments. Whether we watch a movie, flip through the news, click Like on Instagram, or write an article - all that we see is generated by the finely tuned choreography of screen subpixels. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All colors are created by adjusting the light emitted by the red, green and blue subpixels. If you unscrew them all to full brightness (RGB 255 255 255), the pixel will look white, because the cells in our eyes will perceive waves of all lengths and “mix” them. This is called </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">additive blending</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Its opposite, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">subtractive mixing</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, easier to illustrate with paint. Each of the colors absorbs, or subtracts certain wavelengths, preventing them from reflecting and getting into your eye. If you turn off all subpixels, you get a black color (RGB 0 0 0). By changing the intensity of each subpixel, you can get millions of colors. For example, a red subpixel with a maximum luminosity (R 255), a green subpixel glowing on ¾ (G 190) and not working blue (B 0), will give a yellow color, like an egg yolk. Add blue to ¾ power, and get pink like </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">pink bismuth</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Remove red to make mint green.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most actively, Stanley-Marbel behaves in the laboratory, surrounded by a cell for flying drones and rows of microscopes. He is fascinated by the interface of programs and hardware. He carefully and inventively thinks out calculations aimed at creating prototypes that help to understand the physics of displays and human perception. This desire led him into the world of a bright and promiscuous world of color, and after that - to Specimen. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The germ of the idea, which then grows to </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Project Crayon</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, appeared in late 2006, when he was a postdoc at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. At that time, OLED displays caused a stir, as the next step after LED - liquid crystal displays (LCDs). They are still used only in the most expensive and flagship devices, for example, in the iPhone, starting with Model X, and the newest large TVs. However, in the technology industry, it is believed that OLED will soon supplant LEDs. Unlike screens where pixels are illuminated by lamps, OLEDs themselves glow; hence the display resembling a “Throne" under a microscope. Screens using this technology can be made thinner, more energy efficient, and the images on them look sharper.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93e/65c/a11/93e65ca111f8377f23ceea0e0a1473e2.jpg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They, as always, have disadvantages. One of them is related to color. “At that time, in many commercial documents there was a section where it was written, in essence: carefully, energy consumption may differ depending on the color content,” says Stanley-Marbel. He developed iron for further testing, but it was a side project, and he did not go further than simply confirming that different colors really require different amounts of energy to show. In the six years since his transition to IBM in 2008, he has not recalled OLED and its features. But when he returned to science, first to MIT, and then to Cambridge, he blew off the dust from the old project and returned to work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Organic” in OLED refers to various compounds that produce red, blue, and green. These components differ in color generation efficiency and aging rate. And usually, the older they get, the more current is required to get the same brightness which makes them age even faster. The health and effectiveness of the subpixels have a critical impact on battery life. The situation, of course, varies depending on the brightness of the screen and what it shows, but often the screens consume from a quarter to half of the phone’s energy. It also affects the digital world of the future.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“At maximum brightness,” says Stanley-Marbel, “blue subpixels usually require more current, and they age faster than red or green.” I ask - that is, theoretically, a person who wants to keep the screen in the best condition should avoid images with a high content of blue? “That's right,” he says. We both look down at the telephone recording our conversation. On a screen saver, my husband in jeans holds a puppy standing on a pale Norfolk beach against a blue sea turning into a blue sky.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d0/f89/f4c/2d0f89f4c742ffe95b0ea10a1f592f0c.jpg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Stanley-Marbel suddenly wrote an email to Gorochau, Whitney and Randazzo in December 2015, when he worked at the IT and AI lab at MIT. He explained that he had stumbled upon Specimen because he was interested in color, and in particular on color perception data. Then he got down to business: “Question: would you like to share your data or somehow establish cooperation?” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first thing that Gorochau felt when she received a letter from Stanley-Marbel was delight: after all, she believed from the very beginning that this game could reveal something unknown in the process of color perception. Randazzo recalls feeling relieved. “We are like this: well, in general we have a lot of data, only there is no experience in order to process and understand them.”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To help plunge into the confusing thicket of data collected by Specimen, Stanley-Marbel took a few scientists who already knew about the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Project Crayon</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> project </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: Martin Rinard and Jose Cambronero from MIT and Virginia Estellers from the University of California at Los Angeles. And immediately unexpected and strange things showed up. Stanley-Marbel teaches a course on displays, and asks students every year: “What color are people most sensitive to?” Students usually respond to green. By the way, Randazzo, Gorochau and Whitney heard the same thing, so they made Jade, emerald, pea and mint shades appear more often in Specimen. “It turned out - at least judging by Specimen - that most of the errors were related to shades close to green,” says Stanley-Marbel.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The data also confirmed a funny observation that intrigued the creators of Specimen: how much different players can differ from each other. “Some people immediately begin to play very well,” recalls Gorochau. The rest face difficulties - they cannot move on, regardless of the number of attempts. "The most persistent gradually improved the results, but it was clear who has natural talent." </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b7/305/c6f/0b7305c6fd471b420758a53c67069607.jpg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stanley-Marbella Lab OLED Display</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Justin Gignac, proud of his color perception, was one of the most talented players. Gorochau introduced us by e-mail when I asked for a conversation with some loyal player. Gignac is a creative director and artist from New York, co-founder of a working notary recruiting company for designers and creative directors, and since 2001 he has sold more than 1300 </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">rubbish cubes</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - “100% real garbage from New York, collected manually and packed in transparent plastic cubes ”- at $ 50- $ 100 apiece.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He's good at playing games like Specimen that test and reward creative skills. “There was such a kerning game where I got 99% marks” [Kern Type - in the game you need to set the distance between the letters so that it looks beautiful]. He hung out at Specimen for several weeks. “It was a great challenge,” he says. “It was possible to play using different techniques - for example, concentrating on the drops near the edge of the Petri dish, which were closest to the background.” And then something remarkable happened: he won by completing all six levels from Alpha to Zeta, becoming the first among the players to do so.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Gignac, unlike Gorochau, does not consider this a natural talent. He talks about how his high-school drawing teacher made everyone, lesson after lesson, paint colorful gradients in 10 × 10 squares using small brushes. Each square should be a little paler, or a little more red, or a little more gray, compared to the previous one. “It was very boring,” he says. “But you can definitely train to better recognize colors.” You will learn how adding a very small amount of pigment significantly affects the result. ” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another surprise was waiting for Stanley-Marbela and colleagues when they looked at the geographic separation of data collected by Specimen. Since the 19th century, there has been debate about the connection between language and color perception. Since the 1960s, they have only escalated. "It's a bit like </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Brexit</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Says Jules Davidoff, a professor of psychology at Goldsmith College at the University of London with tousled gray hair. He studied the issue of color perception for two decades. “People cling to their opinions on this issue.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, this discussion came to the discussion of the following question - is it possible to divide the colors into 11 basic shades - pink, orange, yellow, blue, etc. - and what does it mean if there are fewer of them in a certain language, and also whether special cultural factors influence the perception of colors. For example, the people of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Himba</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, who lives in Namibia, uses five categories of color, which will be difficult for an English speaker to understand. “It's not that they saw individual colors in any other way,” Davidoff explains. - Color vision mainly depends on the presence of receptors in the eyes (although this may vary in different people). It’s just that if different flowers have the same name, they seem more similar to you. And if you do not have names for flowers, this affects your perception of them. " </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today it is difficult to study the idea that people who speak different languages ​​think or see differently. Perhaps that is why, every time our conversation approaches this area, Stanley-Marbel begins to worry. In response to his revelation about green, I ask the obvious question: where do we make the fewest mistakes? “The most accurate data is associated with red. But, again, what can be called 'red', - he deviates from the topic. “I can show you the graph and poke my finger, and whether you find this color red or not is already subjective.”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are other limitations and complications in the data collected. Cambronero, a graduate student at MIT who worked with Stanley-Marbel on this part of the project, recalls how he was struck by the global nature of the game. "It was played in Japan, in China, in Egypt, in Norway and Finland." However, in some countries there were definitely more players (USA, Germany, China) than in others (Tunisia, Hungary, Qatar). And there are also problems with different phone models, lighting, and even cultural practices. “In the Netherlands, I often watched people ride bicycles and type a message on the phone,” warns Stanley-Marbel. “Therefore, it is possible that someone is playing Specimen, and while riding a bicycle. And then - do you collect statistics about the perception of people riding a bicycle, or people living in the Netherlands? ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Given all this vast number of reservations, in the data (which at the time of publication were not published or reviewed), you can really find a certain number of geographical features. Median user accuracy varies from 83.5% in Norway to 73.8% in Saudi Arabia, with standard deviations of 5.98% and 13.02%, respectively. In Scandinavia, players were especially good at recognizing red and purple hues, and it was hard for users from India and Pakistan to distinguish between them. Singaporeans defined green with a yellow hue better than without it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Stanley-Marbel and his team cannot make meaningful conclusions from this data; because they are engaged in computer science and electrical engineering. Cambronero is pleased with the prospect of a color specialist examining these data. Stanley Marbel hesitates. “I think it’s very hard for people to study themselves,” he says slowly. - I think that I am engaged in engineering and physical sciences because other topics seem to me too complicated. It’s easier for me to be objective with bits and atoms. ” </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For Stanley-Marbel, the vagaries of OLED technology also presented a potential opportunity - a challenge for the engineer, an attempt to save energy by choosing the most energy-efficient colors. He reasoned as follows: if you adjust the image palette, then you can get real energy savings. “Let's take three colors for which R is close to zero, G is close to 255, B is close to zero,” he says. “If these three colors use different amounts of energy, then perhaps we can take advantage of this.” The only question is whether people will see the difference. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Stanley-Marbel has already begun sketching a program that can save energy on OLED devices by reducing image quality. She divides the color space into groups of closely related shades. If you want to display some color from the group, the most energy-efficient one is shown instead. The program worked, but the images could easily be distinguished from the originals. Therefore, the program required a less random way of dividing colors into subsets.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Based on the data collected by Specimen, the project participants divided the colors in a new way, bringing together those colors that seemed similar to the players, without using any other grouping methods. “Take for example greenish and yellowish colors. They may not stand side by side in the RGB color space, however, judging by the game’s data, they seemed equivalent to some of the population, ”says Stanley-Marbel. - We use these games to create such subsets of equivalent colors. Then, based on the selected subsets, we see if we can replace the RGB value on the screen with a different color from the same subset, but with less power consumption. "</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They named Ishihara a new approach in honor of Shinobu Ishihara, the creator of color sensitivity tests, where numbers are made up of colorful dots. The program saved up to 15% of energy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They tried another approach - a special program for image compression, adapted for people with imperfect vision. Stanley-Marbel and Cambronero found one user whose personal data was not disclosed, who constantly pressed ultramarine drops when the background color was olive; on grape color instead of citrus yellow; on green instead of purple. For such people, it makes no sense to display thousands of flowers on the screen, because they still do not see the difference between them. The DaltonQuant program they are working on essentially eliminates all shades from the images that the person does not see the difference. And compared with the best modern image compression algorithms, their program can reduce file size by 29%, which allows you to download images much faster.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
DaltonQuant has obvious limitations. The conversion should be one-sided, that is, work only for things that you are not going to share with others - for example, for icons. It needs to be tailored for each user, since the flaws in color perception are manifested in different ways - you cannot put all users in a game in Specimen for several hours in a row.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ishihara and other Project Crayon projects look more promising. “My phone already has this setting to save energy,” Cambronero says. “It seems to me that such a setting has the right to be among the options for saving battery.” Stanley-Marbel says that some manufacturers of screens or devices with screens have already shown interest in their project, but he still can not talk about it. As for other questions regarding the perception of color, on which this data could shed light - the team posted them, as well as some tools for processing them, in the public domain. Gorochau is only glad that other researchers can access their data. “It was pretty reckless to create a color game to expand our understanding of color,” she says. “It's unbelievable that this approach worked.” I just want to,so that the data continues to fall into the right hands. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I recall my conversation with Gignac, and I think about whether, by playing such games, it is possible to learn how to better recognize changes in hue, saturation and brightness. I ask - did they notice changes in the color perception of some users in the process of working on this topic? Stanley-Marbel says they have not studied this issue. “By analogy, we can imagine that, for example, I began to learn to play the cello, and before that I could not read music and did not play the instruments. However, the training made me more susceptible to music. In that sense, people who often play Specimen might not get much benefit from optimization algorithms like Ishihara. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He thinks about it for a while, perhaps like me, evaluating the compromises that we could make for the sake of a faster and more energy-efficient digital world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How many perceived colors could we refuse? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the train on the way back, I went through several rounds of the game and chose another photo of my family as a screensaver - this time, with a predominance of autumn foliage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I decided to cut off the sky.</font></font></div>
