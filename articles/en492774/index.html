In the context of the pandemic of the coronavirus, quarantines, closed borders and self-isolation, everyone bury the old-school business first of all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to survive travel agencies, cinemas and restaurants, if everyone is sitting at home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Digital business, on the contrary, rubs its hands and fights for the attention of consumers who have sat down at home. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But in IT, the industry, which has not yet become fully mature and has just announced itself, can suffer greatly - services for offline meetings with strangers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even before the announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic and before the introduction of emergencies in many countries, we talked with Elizabeth Oreshkina. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She, together with Eteri Saneblidze, makes </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Breakfast</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> app </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, which brings strangers together for breakfast and resembles a closed club only for their own. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We are with Ivan Zvyagin (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) discussed why people suddenly again wanted to chat offline, and how in the modern world to do a startup that does not chase a mass audience and huge numbers.</font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Over the past few months, I have already learned about several startups that remove romance from the mechanics of dating. They make people just meet and talk. What's happening?</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
- It became possible just thanks to the dating. They removed the taboo on meeting strangers, it has already become part of life. On the other hand, the number of people we see and recognize is very much reduced, especially among those who have already grown up, graduated from high school, and college. We may accidentally meet someone at work, but work is a specific context, not everyone is ready to leave it and communicate not only about work. And where to meet people for communication? Unclear.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
General events do not greatly contribute to this. Only good experience works when you are experiencing something together, and after that you have a contact. But there are very few such situations, because now we spend most of our lives at computers - and the need for contacts is very large. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- On the contrary, it seems to me that it has never been so easy to get acquainted. We have social networks, a lot of places where people gather. We are no longer wild and pose no serious danger to each other.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- I will return to the example of dating again. Today, getting up and talking with a person at a bar has become much worse than 30 years ago, because there is a Tinder for this. It protects you from a possible fail. Despite the fact that this feil, in fact, makes you alive, makes you feel brave, feel the heartbeat. This is the heartbeat that you are experiencing - it is very important, because if the contact is made, it becomes more significant - you feel yourself, overcome yourself a little. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All technologies that replace overcoming with comfort kill us a little. People feel it. More precisely, they feel a lack of something, but do not understand what. I think that the request for a new way of dating is also a desire to get this experience, communicate, feel, but with the necessary degree of comfort.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI agree that this is a defense, but I agree that it is killing us.‚Äù</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
- She simplifies. You can write on Facebook to people who are interesting to you, and invite them to meet, but this is still a discomfort. First you need to add as a friend, a person should be with you in the same city. You don‚Äôt even know what kind of person this is, because he writes something cool, but in fact he can be very gloomy or not interesting. Quite often it happens. Naturally, people do not want to encounter this. On the one hand, they can be understood, on the other hand, the situation is contradictory.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It would be very cool if people just came up, talked, knew how to smile at each other in the subway, react and interact easily. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it is difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is especially difficult in the post-Soviet space, we are all a little afraid of each other for a bunch of deep reasons. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I would be happy to live in a world where I can talk to anyone about anything and feel good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I would do something else, because such a problem would not exist. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would like the distance to be reduced, and the desire to be frank with each other, without fear, would grow. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a>)     .      , ,      .     1500,   10    ,   .          ,    ‚Äî       ,   ,      .  ,      .   ,      .       ,   ?</b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- We now live in the world of technology, it was created by engineers, and human interaction is reduced to a simple exchange of information. It seems that on this Facebook you will find out everything you need to know, see how people live, sort of even communicate. But this is an absolute lie. You communicate when you smell a person, when you look at each other, you see movement, reactions to words. It is very easy to confuse one with the other.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But in fact, the difference is huge. From personal communication you immediately receive a physiological feedback, you begin to feel physically different. The less such contact in life, the more stress it causes, because it is a physiological need. We can deceive ourselves that this is not necessary, that the need is closed by other means, and sometimes we may not be aware of the need at all. The number of depression is growing for a reason. A person has no way to feel. It sounds a bit arrogant, but it's physiology.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Judging by Tinder‚Äôs analytics, the main goal of about a third of its users is simply to get a match and see that someone likes them. Then they turn on the telly and fall asleep happy under the series. It is simply a satisfaction of vanity, and you can go no further. We don‚Äôt want that, we want to get people to go out to meetings. This is a very difficult task, because laziness comes out, but on the other hand, we communicate with our users and see that they are, that not everyone is lazy.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- Firstly, it‚Äôs definitely not worth talking about all the people. People are very different, someone really does not need a lot of friends and they will be fine. Another thing, this ‚ÄúI'm fine‚Äù is also a complex concept. People are very inclined to deceive themselves. If they are put in a different situation, they will say "damn it, what didn‚Äôt you say before ?!" Even if you know that a person is deceiving himself, you can‚Äôt tell him that. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is a stereotype that only those who don‚Äôt succeed do not want to communicate, it has a certain logic. This is such an instrument of psychological defense: if you are not successful in society, then you will most likely decide that you don‚Äôt need communication - you save yourself from this situation by avoiding it. Or you accept this challenge and start to do something with it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is another stereotype that successful people need to communicate less than unsuccessful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I was amazed when people in whom something happened in life and it turns out began to come to us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a very interesting phenomenon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have achieved something, then most likely you are different in something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You could build a life, you could develop professionally, but apparently there are no people around you like you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Basically, you are surrounded by people whom you hired to work or the family that you started. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you are very much short of people who have faced the same problems.</font></font><br>

<b>‚Äî (<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link">baragol</a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) You got an idea, you developed a design. How long did the development take?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
- The product is not made in the spirit of "guys, here are the layouts, make them." You come up with something, collect, look, it turns out garbage, redo it. This is all a long process with a wild number of iterations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A little over a year ago, we started without development. We launched the landing, looked at the reaction, collected the first set of comers - it took three days, because we can do it. Cool, cool and fast. It was nice to get 3000 instead of 300 people. Then you correct the concept, and then it becomes overgrown with details, development begins, then everything changes, and this is an ongoing process. You do, change, introduce, cut, return again.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This fall, we started and immediately heavily sawed through the mechanics. We called the first users and immediately realized that we created a tinder-like monster, which still does not work. They began to remodel. It was a rather painful process, which took two months. Now everything is fine. We are getting ready for scaling. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Are you not afraid that you are in a hurry with the exit? In reviews, people complain about mistakes and underestimate.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- There are 20 ratings, and that‚Äôs not something that you should worry about. People complain about the problem with downloading the photo, and I have a suspicion that it is wrong with it. Perhaps the photo is too large, we process it in the background, and the person should wait a little longer than he used to. At some point, he gets angry and goes to write a review, believing that the photo has not been uploaded. This is normal and it is easily repaired. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, I will not say that everything is so unstable here. In some places, the application is dumb. For example, it‚Äôs very annoying how the chat works, but at least it‚Äôs clear what to do with it. A new version will be released in a couple of weeks, and it will be a little better. A month ago, we tested the load. With the volume that we need now, the application works fine. At the maximum, it slows down a little, but not much.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If suddenly in one day several thousand people register, then we will withstand - this has already happened. Inside, after registration, a large number of invited users will be more difficult to withstand. But there isn‚Äôt much going on right now, we‚Äôre not in a hurry with this. In addition, users are divided by city, this also facilitates the situation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the guys who advised us on the load, said that he had two friends of the project, who at the start could not withstand the load and died. In fact, I suspect that they died before the launch, because for two years they could not start, they were wildly tired, burned out and did not want anything. Naturally, when they fell, they immediately decided, "Oh, I‚Äôll probably go to work and get a job."</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I also heard many stories about startups that made a prototype the night before the presentation, received investments, started up and died, because they spent all their money on rewriting and solving problems on the go, instead of growing and adding new features.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
- Any project that has just started is always in a state where something needs to be done constantly. There is no such thing that we will design, blind and it will just start working. Ten years ago, they came to me with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãproducts, and I wrote technical assignments for them. I thought, now I‚Äôll clearly write everything, and it will be cool. This is the worst thing I could offer. Developing something in advance and fully designed, you make a stillborn thing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Without feedback, without the ability to fix and change something on a living, a good product cannot be made. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The task of any small project is to make sure that you have the opportunity to tuning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we see that a lot of changes are being made with crutches, then I understand that it is necessary to take time, otherwise it will be impossible to change later. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a question of the process and how you organize everything. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is your application written on? </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- React native and Ruby on Rails </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) And who chose them? Why not native?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
- This is what many scare us. But while it‚Äôs hard to scare. Essentially, this is to make it faster. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- When people choose React Native, they speak not only about speed, but also that the application is everywhere - desktop, android.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
- We didn‚Äôt have fast and everywhere, because the pool of the audience on which we set were primarily people with iPhones. We were not going to cover everyone at once, and we generally do not have the task of being accessible to everyone with basic registration. We have a complicated registration. It is necessary to torment to pass it. Our task now is to check some key things, do them well, and then it‚Äôs logical to develop where it is logical to develop.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why ROR? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We once had an article about whether Ruby died, and people decided they kind of died. </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- Interesting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is rather a coincidence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did the previous Ruby project, so the choice is more likely connected with the expertise of the developer, with whom we have been working together for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But realizing that now - in such a configuration - this works fine, and then everything will change in any case, then what's the difference? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main thing is that it works now, it is stable and brings value. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) Do you think there will be a stage when you have to rewrite everything cleanly? </font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- I think yes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will be very surprised if this does not happen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will be cool if we can develop sequentially, but there is also the issue of scaling the team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I‚Äôm still not a developer, and I have never been one, so I understand that I won‚Äôt take such decisions without a strong, versatile development team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the application works, people have breakfast and are happy, now this is enough for us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in general, I do not know of a single project that would not correspond in the second or third year of existence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is normal.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
- Magic ruined everything. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a>)  ,  . -,   ,    .  5    ,    .    2,5 ,  .  ,     ?      .</b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- Not everything is perfect, it is true, and we understand that. Now you are given one chance in 24 hours. Two scenarios come out of here. Or you regularly throw announcements until you find someone you are going to have breakfast with. Or you liked the person, you quickly agreed on breakfast, and you can immediately get a new chance after that. An ideal scenario when you use the application as you wish. You understand that in the next three days I‚Äôm ready to have breakfast with someone, you press the button, you come across a person who also pressed it. We do not account for all the people that we have, we only connect those who also pressed the button and are also ready to have breakfast in the coming days. That is, we do not use the entire user pool, but a much smaller part of it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our task is to select people who are truly motivated. Now companies are a bit corrupted by the need to grow rapidly and grow their audience. They come to them just to try, and normal, average companies are happy about this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And we are not happy, we want people who are ready to invest in themselves and really go to breakfast with someone unfamiliar. Accordingly, such people are much fewer. So in your case there is a chance that you would simply not get into the application yourself, this is first. But of course we have people who just want to try and don‚Äôt know what will happen next. We need to learn how to better direct these people, to tell that on the other end of the wire is also a living person - and he wants to have breakfast. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And how are couples selected?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- We do not select people according to their interests or according to any one parameter. We are interested in a story about how to build a human community at the level of informative trust. Our life experience suggests that people like something simply because they like it. People may not have anything in common on an objective level, but together they are interested.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It‚Äôs quite difficult to create compatibility by matching rough parameters like a general profession. There is still a question of goals. Some people have no idea why they should communicate if they cannot discuss something at work. We really want this to change globally. But since now 85% of people do not know how to interact with their emotions, auxiliary tools are needed. So far, we rely on the fact that almost all of the members of Brekfast are cool. Since all people came from a waiting list or at the personal invitation of those who are already inside, everyone is at least normal with everyone, because they are already at a certain level of maturity and are able to have a good time with one another, one and a half or four (this is also It was).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Obviously, with development we will have to clarify some things. We will have both a sphere of professional interests and finer things, which I will not talk about so far. But in general, attempts to predict human behavior and thoughts have always failed. The whole system of human relations boils down to the fact that we like people who know how to negotiate, and who freak out less - that's all. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Curation of the waiting list is a way to select people who have already done at least something in their lives, have gained life experiences that can be shared. That is why they are interested in communicating with people not from their industry. In their own way, they know everyone they need, and they feel confident. They are interested in something beyond this. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúBut when a community grows, problems always begin.‚Äù</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- Of course. This is inevitable, but I do not think that we will refuse curation. Most likely, we just technology it. Perhaps, with a large amount of data, the machine will be able to create the best breakfast possible, but it is also possible that it cannot. Here no one knows, we must try. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, people have the expectation that they will now slip the perfect person, and they will be happy with him until the end of life. The problem is that when any relationship is built, the question is not ‚Äúwhat are you‚Äù, but the question, ‚Äúhow do we relate to each other‚Äù - what are we doing for each other. I don‚Äôt want to think about it, because it‚Äôs work, and everyone wants fairy tales to make it happen.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And in fact, the solution is simple - go for breakfast with a person, but with some good mood. Even if we do not do anything from the point of view of segmentation, I think that this may well work if everything is served correctly. We have a bunch of hypotheses, including non-trivial and slightly secret ones. We really want to try and break them in. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who is currently looking at profiles to issue an invite?</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
- We are watching, with our hands. Obviously, we can make a mistake, and that we do not perfectly convey to people how everything works. For example, an invite is not a viral mechanic in order to make a lot of people, but, on the contrary, to have few people, and to make everyone cool. People are not used to this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A person who is ready to tell about himself understands that the other needs to see with whom he is communicating. Therefore, he tries to formulate something about himself. And if a person puts only a smiley in his profile, then it is clear that he does not think about it. People are not accustomed to thinking about others. This is a big problem for all current applications - we are distant, we don‚Äôt understand anything about each other. This is a sick thing that we are gradually changing. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If a person told about himself, can you still not give him an invite?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúYes, it can be, and it is obvious that we can be wrong.‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We see that a person is from creative industries, that he creates something, and that he identifies with this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have a small percentage of people who write about their height, about the fact that they like to travel and have breakfast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a description that does not characterize them in any way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Either the person did not fully understand the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBrekfast, or he has nothing more to say about himself. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now we invite somewhere 5-10%, another 10% we doubt, and all the other people are simply not worn out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if you are not tired, what will you do at breakfast? </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) On your landing page for the press it is directly written that English proficiency is a selection criterion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Moscow, St. Petersburg and maybe in Lisbon, this falls into the right group. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But what about New York? </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- It‚Äôs hard to talk about New York specifically, because we haven‚Äôt felt it right yet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Americans even have different social media profiles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Russia there is a cult of social vanity, with us any person thinks about a personal brand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the West it is not, people live their own lives, for them Facebook is just Facebook. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is rather personal communication with friends. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Good question, how will our curation be arranged there. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) In general, what is the weight of this criterion - English? </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- Small. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it works rather poorly: to press the button - you do not need to know English. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some people cope with the interface, but what we asked them to do is simply ignored. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And of course, they think that they should get invites in any case, despite the fact that they have been written to them many times how everything works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For us, this is just one of the selection criteria. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) If this one has a minimum weight, then why is there no bilingualism? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just easier to maintain? </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúAnd that too.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) Or do you immediately mark there? </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- Yes, we just won‚Äôt be able to start simultaneously everywhere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have changed the mechanics very much while we work in Moscow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we launch a city in the country. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it is absolutely certain that the mechanics will continue to change. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We try to be as flexible as possible while we manage to do it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, I would like the people who are in The Breakfast to get everywhere a similar experience: in Paris, Los Angeles or St. Petersburg. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, I‚Äôm doing the application here, at the same time I have customers in the aircraft, and I live in general it is not clear where the last 4 years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is a pretty relevant situation for many people from our audience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want to combine them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">English for them is just a way of communication and work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is vital. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) And what is the base on the waiting list? </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we talk about the waiting list, then a total of 6000, we collected it in two stages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of those who received an invite, which is 5-10% of the waiting list plus invited by users, about half of the people subscribe and use, which is pretty cool. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">baragol</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) What do you earn? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or are you planning to earn? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because if you multiply, 200 pieces per month is not money. </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- Of course, not money, but we just started - in the current form we started three months ago. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And a year ago they published the first announcement, just to look at the reaction of people. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now our task is to configure all the basic processes within the product - this is the earliest stage, but it is very exciting and we manage to make it fun. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We value quality, product style, our audience, its reality - we focus on this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We really bother now and naturally believe that the contribution to the project is long-term.</font></font></div>
