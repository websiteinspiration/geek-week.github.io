<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, take the Scrum methodology, which many companies use today. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The central idea of ​​Scrum is to take no more tasks into the sprint than your team is able to complete during this time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first glance, it sounds reasonable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, too often in practice this approach slows down the work of the team in exchange for the illusion of planning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let me explain why.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Evaluations hinder team work</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Doing your job well is an absolutely natural desire for most people. At first, almost all developers are optimistic and underestimate the time required to complete the tasks. What inevitably happens next: they agree to implement the task for the period that they themselves have called, and do not have time. Even if no one reproaches them for this (which, incidentally, is not always the case), this creates a certain discomfort. As this situation repeats over and over, people learn to give estimates “with a margin”, because being late with the deadlines that you yourself called is not a very pleasant story. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Contrary to intuition, naming the terms “with a margin” does not necessarily help to fit into them. This effect is known as </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Parkinson’s First Law.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, here psychology plays against us. Imagine that you assume that the task will take a couple of days. However, taking into account all the unknowns and taking into account the past sad experience, you call the term “week”. Let's say your manager says “okay” and you get to work. The first feeling you have is enough time! You have just agreed on a term with a good supply. Therefore, the first half of the week passes either in a relaxed mode, or, more often, you switch your priorities to other tasks for which there was no time before. As the appointed time draws nearer, you take up the job thoroughly, and it is here that the very surprises begin to come up on which you, in fact, were laying a reserve. You work hard maybestaying up late at work and, as a result, hardly fit (or do not fit) into the period that you yourself called “with a margin”. The next time the same story repeats itself again.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Problems can arise no matter how you approach grades. If people underestimate, they often have to cut corners somewhere to meet the deadline. Surprisingly, if estimates are issued “with a margin”, then exactly the same thing happens, only later. As </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maxim Dorofeev</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> aptly put it </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in one of his reports, “the deadline is the deadline before which the task will not be completed under any circumstances.” </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Source: Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Human Factor</font></font></a></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Best performance is shown by teams that do not use grades. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The more often you ask your team about ratings, the more you slow down its work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If your team has to evaluate all their work in general, then this slowdown reaches its maximum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, people spend time on the initial estimates, then they discuss why the estimates did not come true and what to do next (the usual solution is to require new estimates), and then the requirements change, and voila - you need to evaluate how the change in requirements affected the estimates. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the team has to deal with the technical debt accumulated in numerous attempts to meet its own estimates, which slows down the project in the long run.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finger to the sky</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Complexity and uncertainty are constant companions in software development. Almost everything we do as developers is something new. Even if we did something similar in the past, now we do it in new conditions. This may be a new project, or new requirements, or our knowledge gained over the past time from past experience. If the task is typical and regularly repeated, then someone must have automated it and suggested it in the form of a finished product, library, or framework. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, developers have to give estimates for tasks with a high degree of uncertainty. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11d/5f2/619/11d5f2619969fc8978bcde15073110ff.png" alt="Figuring out what to do - Getting it done"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Source - </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Show Progress | Shape Up by BaseCamp</font></font></a></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It would be better if the developers had the opportunity to work on the task for some time before issuing the grades. In this case, they could better understand the problem and would be much more confident in their assessments. Unfortunately, this is rare in practice. As a rule, developers have very little time to study the task before they are required to provide an assessment. As a result, the scores are essentially poking a finger at the sky.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, all experienced managers know that ratings are just estimates, and they don’t try to interpret them as hard deadlines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, evaluations are still perceived as some form of promise. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If estimates didn’t mean anything at all - why would you ask about them in principle? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Issuing an assessment means a certain degree of readiness to complete a task in a specified time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not surprising that many developers do not like this - in fact, they are asked to subscribe to terms for what they themselves do not fully understand.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Estimates create dangerous distortion</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Poor accuracy is not the only assessment problem. In addition, they distort the idea of ​​how software development works in general. As Fred Brooks said, “carrying a baby takes 9 months, regardless of how many women are entrusted with it.” However, when people hear that “the project will take 9 person-months”, they might think that this is essentially 3 months of work for a team of 3 arbitrary developers. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
People and months are not interchangeable, and this is not only because some work cannot be performed in parallel. </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">performs work, is also of great importance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An experienced developer, who is also familiar with the subject area, could possibly fulfill it much faster and better than expectations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And June, for which the whole project is new, seriously risks not only not meeting deadlines, but also completely failing the task.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Initial development is the least cost</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c98/eb8/874/c98eb8874b84718f45b8d6f165740e28.png" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
People constantly ask for estimates for initial development, but few people are interested in estimates for subsequent support of a solution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is a big problem, support is very serious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Support can take up to </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">60-80% of</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> all project costs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, each new feature that you add to the product adds complexity and slows down subsequent development.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In theory, people should be very careful with the choice of tasks for development and work only on what is of the highest value for the product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, in project-driven projects, people tend to promote features that do not require large initial implementation costs and put off what seems complicated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, the most important work risks being delayed, and the product is cluttered with minor features and crutches.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to manage a project without ratings</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, let the estimates require sacrifice. They may be inaccurate, they slow down the team, and perhaps the developers sometimes do not like them. But we still need estimates for project planning, right? In fact, optional. Yes, sometimes evaluations are really needed, but in many cases they are not required to make project decisions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, evaluations should not be the main factor influencing priorities for the development team. Work on what is important, not what can be done quickly. If you do not have absolute confidence that this feature is important, it should not be considered at all for full development. Use MVP and product discovery to identify the real needs of your users.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Secondly, if you have a certain deadline or expectations from the business that you need to meet, let them know to your team, instead of asking for their ratings. There is a wonderful approach </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fix Time and Budget, Flex Scope</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Each problem can be solved in many different ways. Carefully prioritize requirements and work on them from the most important to the less important, and be prepared to start the project at any time. In such circumstances, working with deadlines is much easier. Even if you fail to fully complete the project by the deadline, you will have time to fulfill the most important requirements and will be ready to launch - and often this is exactly what you need.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thirdly, if you really need an assessment, let the developers work on the task for several days before asking it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are lucky, the task will simply be completed in these few days, and, accordingly, you no longer need an assessment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If not, by then the developer will have a much better understanding of the difficulties in this task, and you will be able to have a more productive discussion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Take into account not only the costs of the initial development, but also the subsequent support of the solution, which can be a much more significant factor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And again - if you are not sure that the task is important, it should not reach the developers at all, even to get an estimate.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Expectations management</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is perhaps the most difficult. As a manager or team leader, you will regularly deal with people who want to know how long this or that project will take. If you ask why people need this information, they usually say that either for planning, or just want to know what to expect at all. We talked about the planning above, now let's talk about expectations. Expectations are natural; it is common for a person to worry about the uncertainty in something that is not indifferent to him. Sometimes your manager asks for an assessment, and you cannot just say “I don't know” to him. What can you do:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>           , ,   ,    .      .           . ,        .       -  ,   ,    ;</li>
<li>      ,    .   ,      ,   ,       .      ,           ,    —        ;</li>
<li>       .                    —       ;</li>
<li>            ,   ,       .       ,         ,   . ,       ,         .           .</li>
</ol><br>
<h2></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Assessments may seem natural and even necessary, but very often they simply mislead people and slow down development. It’s natural for people to simplify things that are difficult to understand, but evaluations often make it easier to understand the software development process beyond measure. Scrum is able to cultivate this oversimplification with its Planning Poker (tm), Velocity dimension and Burndown charts.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most people agree that grades have their drawbacks, but grades give at least something measurable. It is difficult for many to imagine how to manage a project without having anything measurable. Unfortunately, not everything that matters can be measured, and not everything that can be measured matters. In this article, I shared my experience in project management without constantly relying on estimates. Of course, I am not saying that evaluations are completely useless. I want to say that most of the time you should rely on other, more important factors. At </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ivelum,</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> we have been using this approach for many years, and it worked well for our teams.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am well aware that these tips are by no means for everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I had to work with different organizations, large and small, and the vast majority of them relied on evaluations in one form or another. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, at the same time, development in the vast majority of organizations is far from effective. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The way the most productive teams work is sometimes very different from what most do. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps the approach to evaluations is just one of these differences.</font></font></div>
