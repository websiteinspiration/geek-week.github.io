<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In today's world, an instant payment using a bank card or even exclusively its electronic double in a mobile phone will not surprise anyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the card itself - a piece of plastic or - for extremal options - a valuable metal, continues to develop as an independent product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, for most of the planet‚Äôs inhabitants, it may seem surprising that bank cards appeared long before the creation of the Internet, and the squeezed out (embossed) inscription, which is used today rather to protect the card from forgery and to give it a ‚Äústatus,‚Äù was the first prototype of automatic input customer data.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That makes a bank card and glasses case related</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first prototypes of payment cards appeared at the beginning of the 20th century and were made of cardboard. They were not required to be too wear-resistant: they were not inserted into ATMs or other reading devices. They only needed to be presented when making a purchase in a store, cafe or gas station. It was not necessary to talk about some kind of integration of the card with a single information banking system: the task of the first cards was to identify the owner and designate his solvency in a particular chain of stores, gas stations or food chains. Today we would call these cards loyalty cards.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the early 1920s, payment cards began to spread in the fuel trade. In 1924, the General Petroleum Corporation in California began releasing what they called ‚Äúcourtesy cards,‚Äù and other gas station chains quickly followed suit. Cardboard payment cards have been issued to regular customers throughout the United States. With this card, the client could pay for gasoline, as well as buy related products at any of the network stations, which could be at a considerable distance from each other, which allowed to keep the client traveling around the country.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first cards, like other documents, were made of cardboard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since they were used much more often than, say, a passport, they quickly deteriorated and had to be changed, which caused inconvenience to both the organizations that issued the cards and the customers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A large-scale modernization of cards occurred in 1928, when the Boston-based Farrington Manufacturing company, specializing in the manufacture of engraved metal caskets and cases, released a prototype of a metal loyalty card - Charga Plate, which quickly became popular with retail chains.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Embossing as a step towards artificial intelligence</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the issued cards, the owner data was squeezed out (embossed). The buyer, making a purchase, handed the seller a card that, using a special press, the imprinter, imprinted the buyer‚Äôs card on the receipt. That is, the card served as a print confirming the purchase of goods by the card holder. Embossing simplified and accelerated the interaction between the buyer and the seller, as it eliminated the need for the seller to manually fill out the sales receipt and enter the buyer's data into it. If you imagine this operation in the modern world, then, in fact, with the help of such a card a stamp was placed on the check confirming the purchase of goods by a specific client. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Innovation, as </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">advertised</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, allows you to save time on dictating the name to the seller, allows you to identify the customer in any store, and reduces the likelihood of errors when filling out the delivery address and billing. And Charga Plates lasted until the entry into use of real credit cards. Here is </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a card</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (never used!), Which has become a rarity today, can be bought at auction: </font></font><br>

<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cards with the owner‚Äôs name and individual number stamped out have been preserved today and are used in places where trading is carried out in the absence of the Internet: as before, the card is ‚Äúrolled‚Äù in a specialized device that leaves a print of the data on a paper ‚Äúslip‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cardholder leaves with the purchase, and the seller goes to the phone and authorizes the payment by phone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The traveler is faced with such procedures in countries where the development of trade is ahead of the development of information technology.</font></font></blockquote><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chip is not a luxury</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Bank cards that appeared in the middle of the 20th century were already a more complex payment tool, the task of which was not only to identify the client, but also to provide the seller with information about the state of his bank account, as well as to ensure as soon as possible interaction with the bank and transaction. Magnetic strips containing the necessary data appeared on the cards, and later the cards began to be equipped with an electronic chip, providing faster interaction with the cash register.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In their form and appearance, until recently, maps did not significantly evolve. Created in the format of a standard business card - approximately 55 * 90 mm in size (today the standard indicates the exact size of 85.6X53.98X0.76 mm), they exist today, conveniently fit in a wallet. On the card, as before, the main details remain the name of the client and the number of the card tied to the current account. The account number encodes the type of payment system used, the bank identification number and the customer‚Äôs personal number. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The format of a credit card number today is determined by the international standard ISO 7812. In most cases, a credit card number consists of 16 digits. These numbers are used by the most common payment systems VISA and MasterCard in the world. In this case, there are card numbers consisting of 19 or 13 digits.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is in my inscription to you?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first 6 digits of the number are the unique number of the bank that issued the cards - Issuer Identification Number (IIN) or Bank Identification Number (BIN). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this case, the first character of the number printed on the payment card identifies the payment system in which this card works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Diners Club credit card ancestor card numbers, as well as the American Express system or the JCB regional Japanese payment system, start with the number 3, the number 4 indicates the card belongs to the VISA system, 5 - belongs to MasterCard (with the same number, Diners Club cards are issued in the first position in the United States and Canada). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the number 6 in the first place, cards are issued by Discover, Laser and InstaPayment payment systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Russian payment system MIR uses the number 2 in the first position.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The numbers in positions 7 through 15 form the Account Number - the account holder number that is unique to each client. The last digit of the number is the checksum (Checksum), calculated by a certain algorithm and necessary to verify the correctness of the entered data. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the front side of most cards, the surname and name of the card holder are printed. The name is usually put in Latin characters in international transcription, sometimes duplicated in the national language. On the front side of the card, as a rule, its validity is also indicated.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first four or 6 digits of the payment card number, which are displayed on checks and payment receipts, are duplicated under the first four numbers in ‚ÄúOCR 7b‚Äù font. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Other information may also be indicated on the front of the card to simplify card identification. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the back of the card there is a verification code: in the VISA system it is called CVV (card verification value), Master Card CVC (card validation code), in the MIR system it is called three-digit card verification parameter). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are an additional step in protecting the card from misuse, but now they are losing their relevance in connection with the development of multi-factor authentication methods.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Electronics Does Not Help</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Automation of the processes of interaction between bank cards and payment terminals allowed banks, when issuing mass-use cards, to move away from the principle of embossing, simplifying the process of personifying a plastic blank while expanding the possibilities of its electronic filling. Today, the magnetic strip on the card is duplicated by a contact and contactless chip, which allows for interaction with the terminals without the need to insert them into the reader. User details are put on the card less expensive than embossing by laser printing, engraving (indent) and flat printing (flat printed).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important that with the development of the sphere of remote payments using a mobile phone, again, like a hundred years ago, there is a need to develop and improve automation technologies for entering card data into payment systems where interaction at the chip level is impossible. The card again becomes a carrier of visual information relevant to the payment. Only now is the task to simplify data entry into the system not for the seller, but for the user. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Modern technology of automatic recognition of bank cards </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Smart CardReader</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, like the first mechanical machines affixing a card print on a slip, it is aimed at automating the recognition and input of details from various bank cards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The system automatically finds and recognizes the number, expiration date and name of the owner on cards of various formats and various types of printing.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Custom card: marketing or something else?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A bank card has long become a commonplace that is used by billions of people around the world. The bank card market is developing independently, and therefore banks are trying to attract customers with cards that are significantly different from competitor cards. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite the complexity of electronic identification systems in bank cards, visually they do not allow to significantly differentiate the client as a card holder. In the fight for customers and emphasizing their premium status, banks issue non-standard cards using special color and design solutions, creating a texture and mirror surface, using various methods of lamination and foiling.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the manufacture of cards, new materials began to be used - transparent and textured plastic. And again - like a hundred years ago - metal cards appeared, but not copper, but from precious and simply expensive alloys. In addition, some banks issue cards of a non-standard size, as well as with atypical placement of the main details: in the vertical orientation or on the back. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All of these non-standard moves, of course, have a positive effect on customer acquisition, but are a hassle for systems related to processing such cards. We are constantly developing our </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Smart CardReader</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> technology.</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and taught her to successfully deal with the difficulties of recognizing cards associated with arising artifacts when using unusual materials and with an unusual arrangement of details. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if you hold the card upside down.</font></font><br>
