<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sense of situation</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We started working on books in the year 87, plus or minus. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first, what we wrote was a complete crap, but it was already stolen from us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Come with comics in Funny Pictures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They told us: “The question has not yet been resolved,” and immediately thereafter, similar comics came out with the signature of a local artist, only with slightly different characters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, it turned out to be a great blessing, because we understood our low level and decided to redo everything from the very beginning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After that there was a qualitative leap. </font></font><br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrey Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was lucky that when we came to the Enlightenment with our version, we were given an art editor. An amazing woman Lyudmila Vyacheslavovna Antonova. Now she is our great friend, and then she explained to us who we really are. She understood that we had brought the diamond, but it was so unprocessed that all the work needed to be done in a new way. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before that, we had heard about actors, writers, how nervous they are, they can fail. When we wrote, I was a real psycho. Already lived in that world a little bit, when someone pulled me out of him, molested with his stupidities, I could react quite harshly. At night, he jumped up to write something and generally became different. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. T:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We often worked in a graduate student dormitory. They sat down in the corridor, all kinds of people walk past, life is in full swing ... “Let's discuss such an episode,” - I don’t feel like it anymore, but I need to add it. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. Z.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Hands fell very often. Well, that in turn, and not both at once! Sasha and I perfectly complemented each other. Almost all of the great philological decisions are his. I still remember the phrase Sasha uttered during one of the discos. Imagine: the Soviet Union, all the poor. "And this music was loved by John Smith, he is from a poor neighborhood where everyone washes his own Mercedes." Sasha knows how to find such phrases. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.

But without him, I would have stayed with this situation.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Assumption and arrogance of young authors</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Any of us alone would hardly have done that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even without psychological failures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are not Assumption, frankly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here he is, of course, an outstanding writer, although the person, to put it mildly, is not the most pleasant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once we came to an audience with the Great, somehow we organized it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He specifically mixed us with shit, right in the eye. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then we learned that at that time he was writing a similar book about Professor Chaynikov - also about computers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, this is a bad job for him, and by that time we had already written our own. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two little assholes who came from nowhere. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A letter from Alyosha, the protagonist of the book “I Was in the Computer City” </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. T.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We had neither a name nor even an understanding of where to go with this. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. Z.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Insolence was. In the "Enlightenment" we were later told: "Guys, this is the first time we have seen young authors who have requested a circulation payment." That is, young authors are always happy when they receive at least something. They gave a fixed amount - and rolled it off. We immediately asked: “If you will reprint our book, how can we get nothing?” </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. T.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Thinking about the future, we are still scientists. We looked at things more broadly, without complexes and roughly imagined how this world is physically constructed. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.Z .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We understood that this was the right book, we felt with all my gut. The reason we started writing it is still incomprehensible. They gathered to earn some money, but then it was not the first goal. The process is very captured. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I remember our laboratory, little one, the computer is standing. A little further - the printer. And someone complains about you: “Zaretsky scored a science. He is not interested. He’s doing some discos, something else. ” Energy is a lot of it. If somewhere close, it spills out in the other direction. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fact, Andrei’s huge plus is that he thought big. If a book, then let it be republished everywhere. If we write, then we write at the level. Set the task, as in science, and go! There are methods, tools too. We don’t find out what we don’t know. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.Z .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We did not expect that it would be so difficult. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even when there is a manuscript, where to carry it, with whom to negotiate? The Internet was not in the current sense, there was no normal software - all of them are unlicensed. Moreover, it was used by all government agencies. To at least somehow legitimize this, there was, for example, the Unix of Soviet authors. The usual Western Unix, but with a description in Russian - someone figured out and printed the instructions. This was considered normal. Buying software for $ 50 is difficult - it’s a waste of currency, a decision on which is made at the institute’s directorate level. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I typed a book in some kind of text editor. In the Lexicon, most likely. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. Z.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wrote only by hand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although we all created together, played the role of a stenographer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then they drove into the computer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When it became like a text, they made corrections. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Something was thrown away in pieces, changed in pieces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Errors of novice authors: the first time we tried to write sequentially. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, God forbid, one phrase remained from this kilometer of text.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Enlightenment Publishing House</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In Enlightenment, we were very simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My aunt’s husband, Viktor Nikolayevich Likhachev, worked in the government of the RSFSR. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I come to him, I say: “We wrote a book with a friend. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We don’t know what to do with it. ” </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He asked what the book was about, and right in front of me he called the director of the Enlightenment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He said that his nephew wrote something: "Look, right in the trash, or later."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I went to this principal, he immediately called the chief editor of the elementary school and re-kicked me. She took the book, made out that it might be interesting, and then proved it to her. When we later rewrote the text for the fifth, tenth and one hundred and fifth times, she was ready to conclude an agreement with us. When I asked about the draws, she went to the director to punch them. Then we already discussed the story with sequels. On the one hand, of course, they helped us. On the other, I’m thinking now, if there hadn’t been a call from Uncle, we probably would have gone to Enlightenment anyway. Because before that they already went to the "Funny Pictures" and we were a little fooled there. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Not a little, but completely. But it benefited. We rethought a lot. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. Z.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, such strikes are necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A boxer will not become a boxer until his entire jaw is broken. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyway, we would go. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Theoretically, it could turn out that we would go the wrong way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The worst thing is if we got to someone who would say, like Assumption, that we are shit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then, as in "Funny Pictures", I would rewrite the book for myself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are fortunate to have come across decent people. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. T.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The idea was so unusual that a traditional writer would not have accepted it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think he would have gotten another book, artistic, albeit stolen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All these breakthrough cases - feedback, computer, cutouts - this would not have happened. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">None of the then authors needed this.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artists</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We came to Enlightenment with a book already drawn. The comic book format was then popular, it was used both in Murzilka and in Funny Pictures. Initially, our nugget friend Pasha Okolev was to become an artist. We hung out at discos together. Pasha is a tall handsome man; the girls loved him with terrible force. He went to ballroom dancing, and to art school. I drew beautifully. But Pasha drank. The publishing house realized that because of this he would not draw a book, and they found us a professional artist Elina Desyatnyk. Based on the images developed by Pasha, she certainly did everything in her own way and very professionally - the pros are the pros. But initially all the sketches and heroes were Pasha. We really wanted to draw with him, but it didn’t work out. </font></font><br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pasha was not a professional, but as an amateur, he drew only when there was a mood. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He painted perfectly, masterpieces turned out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But when the mood disappeared, he did not work, he also drank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The technological process was violated, this is unacceptable for the publisher. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. Z.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> All the first visual images - both the professor and the cat - Pasha. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He invented Fortran absolutely brilliantly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Professor - therefore, bald, gray-haired, with glasses ... A bit like Dr. Aibolit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A canonical such professor for a child. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bright memory of Pasha, unfortunately, he still drank. </font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Popularity</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> After the release of the book, we received a huge number of letters. Publishing House "Education" even had to allocate a separate room for them. At first I answered all the letters, then I realized that this was impossible. Compiled a few templates. “Dear Vasya!” Then the template - bang, and at the end: "I'm so glad you said such and such." To personalize it. I sent five hundred such letters, and read about a thousand. “This is the first book I read with pleasure.” "We take this book away from each other at home." There were a lot of kind words. Including, about computers: "I'm so glad that I finally got a computer." Though such, but he has it. People cut printers, inserted floppy disks. Everything that we offered them, they did. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrey Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Children asked for advice from Kadabra, from the Professor, asked for advice, finding themselves in difficult life situations. One girl wrote that she had lost a book that belonged to her older sister, but could not find another anywhere. There were such sentimental stories, as many tears welling up. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. Z.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At first I did not think that it was difficult to answer even 100 letters. But two hours a day at the computer was only enough to write 30 pieces. We must read, come up with something personal. It would be terribly interesting for me to see those 500 people who still received these letters. </font></font><br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I still accidentally meet people reading our books. For example, at an exhibition in America, at the stand of his friends, he talked with a lady manager. I say: “But I am such and such. I used to write books. ” - “What books?” “Yes, these are.” She: “It can't be!” It turned out that she moved to America and has been living there for a long time, but she has a book, and she shows it to her children. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. Z.:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Only in those circulations of which we know about two million copies of the book were published, and according to some versions, they were twice as many. In Belarus, a different cover was made. How much is published there, I do not know. But to be honest, we are only happy about this. </font></font><br>

" </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was told that 3 thousand rubles is the average price now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were calls to print a few more circulations for some events, but first you need to deal with copyright.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fight for survival</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrey Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perestroika has everything shattered. The real question was about survival. Thank God, they still paid me a salary at the institute, although it is clear that at that time it did little. Prices soared constantly, everyone was looking for ways to feed their families. When we left the institute, Sasha began to do his own thing, I decided to open a publishing house. He called it "Children's Academy", even managed to raise money by subscription. He promised people that we will write books about robots and a bunch of other things. But the money came in 1992, already turned into candy wrappers. It was no longer possible to print books normally on them - I made smart coloring books and thus got acquainted with printing. In smart coloring, it was also about computers and programming. Since there was no money for colored books, this idea came up - we will draw, and you guys should paint. One part is based on our books with Sasha,I just thought up another one later. About the numbers, something else. There were very good books for that time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Good people helped. One started up, another gave money for paper and print. Pashin, a friend of Lesha Syrtsov, painted pictures. I sold these books in the subway and due to them my family lived for six months, probably. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I remember how grandmas and police drove me. Some aunts did not believe my stories and were touched. An intelligent young man is selling coloring books. Maybe stole. For the author to stand and sell - then it was hard to imagine. Yes, and with an earring in his ear - a suspicious type. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was asked to leave the institute earlier than Andrei. There was no money, no prospects. At that time there were also adventurers who dropped the weight on the ice from the bridge, it cracked, and these unfortunate scientists wrote down how many pieces were split. Mathematical models of the proton subsystem of ice were made in Chernogolovka by our friend theorist Vanya Ryzhkin. The Finns invited him. They have icebreakers, billions of revolutions, some special ice fields are frozen. Russian Vanka arrived for two weeks, painted everything for them, received sneakers and a bottle of brandy as a fee. We then drank it together, and you, Andrei, traded sneakers for him. He said: "You are as healthy as a moose, you don’t need sneakers." </font></font><br>

At VDNH, half of the Moscow pavilion was rented. His wife - a young girl - was engaged in art galleries. I accidentally heard their conversation. “Let's buy this picture, and then we will realize it. What a business! ” “What do you know about business?” I’ll bring two Royal trains now, I’ll sell them - this is business. ” </font></font><br>

In 1994, I founded my company. After some time, the bandits came. They said: “Guys, we will protect you. It costs $ 500 a month. ” Every month two such cabinets came, we even made friends. At one point alone comes. I ask: “Where is Serge?” - “But Serega was overwhelmed.” Everyday answered so. "We will now go with Peter." At the same time, I was a small businessman. We are reading now what happened in big business - hair on end. How many people were shot then! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, we wrote a book in one country, and it came out in another. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We received neither fame nor money and were virtually out of work. The structure of the Academy of Sciences at that moment was covered with a copper basin - the area was leased. In the former laboratories, they even made moonshines with processors for sale, because out of work there remained hungry cool electronics engineers who could automate any process. When all this was boiling over, a more or less stable period began, I met a person in the bookstore who sold comics about Pencil and Samodelkin and claimed that he was the author’s son. We talked, he said that taking a character and selling rights to it is more profitable than writing books: “So I survive. Not from the books themselves, but from the rights to the heroes left from the father. ” </font></font><br>

When I am about to die, I will definitely know that we have done something good in life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although now each of us has his own business and we live a very interesting life, Professor Fortran Encyclopedia is the pinnacle of our human career. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We also have plans for the future, but we are still in a position to search for the ideas people need in today's world, which is so full of information.</font></font></div>
