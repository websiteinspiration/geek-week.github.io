<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4G live broadcast: Peregrine Falcon return</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/s9/-7/ogs9-7-ulh_ygmic8vsvamyzwgm.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As part of a partnership agreement between the Nature Conservation Society, the Stockholm Ornithological Society and Folksam placed four peregrine falcons on the roof of the main Folksam building in Stockholm, on a site specially created for this purpose. The goal was to restore the bird population that disappeared from the capital of Sweden more than 60 years ago due to environmental degradation, as well as extermination.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order to allow everyone to watch the life of the chicks, it was decided to fix two webcams on their nest, the video stream from which went to the Internet. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But when planning live broadcasts, one problem arose - on the roof there was no way to organize a wired Internet connection. InDuo considered this project important and provided the Conel LR77 v2 router, which could provide the necessary speed for broadcasting from webcams in the summer. Despite the very high average temperature that summer, on the Folksam roof, the router worked stably, the connection was excellent and the video stream from the webcams was not interrupted for a second.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
New birds quickly attracted the attention of gulls that had never before seen such birds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On July 5, at 14:22, one of the peregrine falcons spread its wings and flew over the top point of the Folksam building. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was the first peregrine falcon flight in Stockholm in the last 60 years. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Due to the nesting of gulls close to the nest of peregrine falcons, three out of four chicks were caught and taken to Vasteras. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fourth to catch failed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He learned to get away from gulls and fly at high speed over S√∂dermalm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, a new era of peregrine falcons was launched in Stockholm.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Organization of direct radio broadcasting of Vasaloppet using 4G networks</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Every year, live radio Radio Vasaloppet during the ski competition "Vasaloppet" broadcasts both from the arena and from the ski run. Not only the main part of the competition is broadcast. Throughout the week, various events taking place around Vasaloppet are covered. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v-/qq/jb/v-qqjbdfgxulmbxiftwkcnsy0ce.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
UE Teknik has been responsible for broadcasting for many years, this year was no exception. The task that the company had to solve was to organize a live broadcast throughout Vasaloppet (about 90 km), which stretches from Selen to Mura, and has at least nine control points along the route from which the broadcast should be conducted.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Previously, a car was used with a Net1 router, which provided wireless communication with reporters. A car equipped with powerful antennas had a drawback: it had to be relatively close to the reporter. This year, the task was to place a mobile transmitter on the back of the reporter. To accomplish this task, it was necessary to organize data transmission over Wi-Fi and 4G networks with the possibility of using data transmission channels of all available mobile operators in the venue. Wi-Fi was considered for use at the beginning of the route, and on the remaining sections of the route data should be transmitted via 4G networks of available cellular operators. UE Teknik was able to provide coverage of all routes, and this was done with the participation of three mobile operators at once: Telia, Telenor and Net1.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k-/_h/1c/k-_h1cxni_qg4vfzaiyuefuzk68.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To implement the solution proposed by UE Teknik, you need reliable coverage by a mobile network, routers with support for 4G and Wi-Fi, as well as a computer and a power device. To solve the problem, it was decided to use two Conel LR77 v2 routers as the most appropriate technical requirements, such as support for operation at a temperature of -30 ¬∞ C and monitoring channel status and Net1 D35 router for Wi-Fi networks. The data stream on the computer is divided into 2 or 3 streams and transmitted on three different carriers (2x4G and 1xWi-FI), the aggregation of which is carried out on the server. The high-speed audio stream is transmitted to the broadcasting studio. The reporter‚Äôs microphone is connected via USB to a computer, from where the digital audio stream is transmitted wirelessly to the studio.From the studio, the signal is already delivered via fiber optic to the radio transmitting center and to the IP codecs. The advantage of this separation is that the studio has the ability to independently process the audio stream from different sources. The portable equipment is powered by a battery with a capacity of 10 ampere-hours and works for about five hours without recharging. On the day of the competition, there was a need to ensure continuous operation of all equipment for eight hours. For this, the batteries were replaced while moving from one control point to another.On the day of the competition, there was a need to ensure continuous operation of all equipment for eight hours.

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This innovation was well received by users, as it gave more freedom in broadcasting, eliminated the need to do work that is not related to their main activity. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the future, mobile transmitters may become lighter and consume less power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And, perhaps, they will find application in carrying out video broadcasts.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Organization of live video broadcasting</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The FKDV company, which creates video content for publishing it on the Internet, in addition to pre-recording videos, often organizes live broadcasts. To transfer high-quality streaming video, the most stable and reliable connection to the network is required. In this case, it is desirable to have a backup communication channel that allows you to not interrupt data transfer when the main one falls. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2014, FKDV set itself the task of developing a solution that allows data transmission over a cellular network with high reliability. This solution should also make it possible to transfer data through fixed networks, which would allow the use of existing wired infrastructure.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the spring of 2014, FKDV developed a solution based on Debond software. Debond allows you to use Modem Bonding technology supported by Conel LR77 V2F routers, which allows you to connect them to each other and provide load balancing when transmitting streaming video over data channels of cellular operators. When servicing LR77 V2F routers by different operators, data transmission through different networks is possible, which increases the reliability of the connection. This solution does not have a geographic reference, as simply switching between SIM cards (Conel LR77 V2F has 2 SIM card slots) or replacing a SIM card will allow you to connect to a local operator‚Äôs network anywhere or quickly switch to another operator in automatic mode.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nq/g_/1o/nqg_1owsfbgtpwig47gbklfxw1g.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And literally right after the development of this solution, FKDV started organizing an online broadcast of the Helsingborg talk show, held as part of the Almedalen week. Using wireless equipment in this situation is the best suited, as it allows you to access the network anywhere, if necessary. Ultimately, this solution should allow the video stream to be transmitted in high quality from locations remote from settlements at the lowest possible cost. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to Kim Svensson, CTO of FKDV, their task was to create an online UPS. In other words, this is a solution that can reserve a connection, or create it where access to the network through the infrastructure of conventional service providers is impossible.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The technology used is called Modem Bonding and consists in connecting several Conel LR77 V2F routers with each other, which provide data transfer speeds of up to 50 Mb / s (UpLoad) each. To implement this technology, server software, the main ‚Äúmaster‚Äù router and several ‚Äúslave‚Äù routers, which are connected in cascade, are required. This solution allowed FKDV to get as reliable and high-speed Internet connection through the networks of mobile operators as possible, taking into account modern technologies. When several LR77 V2Fs work together, the router that is connected to the operator‚Äôs network with a higher signal level is loaded more than routers that receive a weaker signal. The software used allows you to optimally distribute the load between all routers.On the receiving side is a Debond server that aggregates data received through networks of different operators. Also, through the web interface of the Debond server, you can observe the statistics and status of each router and monitor the status of channels in real time.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This solution was later used for TEDx conferences. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
# internetv√§skan allowed to broadcast lectures on the Internet. The conference was held as part of the Almedalen week and the shooting was carried out on several stationary video cameras connected to a computer that served as a mixer. Real-time video streams were created on the computer and transferred to the network. Initially, it was planned to use the Clarion hotel network for the broadcast, but the low connection speed forced the organizers to use # internetv√§skan, which provided high-speed data transfer to the Internet throughout the event.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúNon-alternative use of the hotel chain would be a disaster for us,‚Äù says Fjk Bj√∂rn Falkevik. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe drop in connection speed, invisible to the rest, is critical for us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Broadcasting should not be interrupted, no matter what quality of communication is currently provided by the service provider, ‚Äùsaid Kim Svensson (FKVD). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also # internetv√§skan allows you to transmit a video stream, for example, from objects moving at high speed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, according to Kim, they broadcast from a car on a freeway between Norrk√∂ping and Stockholm. </font></font><br>
