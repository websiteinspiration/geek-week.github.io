      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/489970/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, if you look impartially, I am a very poor worker. And as a programmer, and as a manager, and as at least someone. But they don‚Äôt kick me out of work. They even raise it periodically, provide resources, opportunities and a TV. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are two reasons (just don‚Äôt tell my boss): I can build relationships (= make intrigues) and cook a ‚ÄúKorean breakfast‚Äù - quickly get into the context of any problem and find a solution. Actually, they hold me for this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But it was not always so. Exactly the opposite - from the first three works I quit myself, and precisely because I did not know how to weave intrigues and quickly delve into the context of tasks, both technical and managerial. And then something changed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, changed and changed - I just enjoyed the result until I read a book about the work of the brain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then everything fell into place. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out to be the default system of the brain.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The default system of the brain</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So far, little is known about the brain default system (DSM), or the network of the passive mode of the brain (SPRM). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was open only in the 21st century. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not a section of the brain, but a kind of network that unites different sections, existing either physically and stationary, or only as a network of neural connections, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">flexible, capable of serious development. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Different functions are attributed to DSM, as a rule - something about wandering in one‚Äôs own thoughts, reflection, fantasies and internal dialogues with fictional characters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs a kind of inner world in which you can travel, communicate, win and lose (if you like to lose).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">JSM is about society</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there is a version that hooked me and made me rethink my own professional experience. According to this version, DSM is a patch made by nature in the last stages of evolution to ensure the existence of the pack. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The more developed some kind of pack animals, the more complicated the relationship in their society. There is alpha, his "women", omega, a bunch of "simple units", someone helped you, and now you owe him, there is your couple and her relatives, etc. There is some kind of relationship between all these individuals. For normal survival in the pack, it would be nice, nature decided, to keep these relationships in mind and track their changes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Animals like monkeys needed this not for fun, but for survival. The more complex the structure of the pack and the relationships in it, the more restrictions on behavior apply. You cannot kiss the beloved wife of an alpha male, otherwise you will quickly become an omega, or a dinner for hyenas. But in time to punch alpha in opening a coconut, while his wife is busy with the morning toilet, and the rest of the guys pick their nose - that‚Äôs it, it will come in handy later. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, according to one version, the DSM was created to perform the work of collecting, updating and maintaining the context of the ‚Äúflock‚Äù. The fate of this in the pack depends on its development in a particular individual.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to research, DSM in nature has one significant limitation - no more than 250 objects are placed there, or rather, subjects, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">members of the pack. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interestingly, a similar figure was called a limiter in the book ‚ÄúLeader and Tribe‚Äù - so many people can be kept in mind normally, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">remember not only their names and surnames, but at least some biography and, most importantly, position and relationships in the tribe.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">JSM in humans</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, sort of, why do we need these monkeys? Wait to run away, then the fun part. People lived in the forest, didn‚Äôt bother, they used DSM as a patch from nature, and everything was fine with them. And then, abruptly, quickly (in terms of evolution), they began to develop. They fly into space, build nuclear power plants, build entire cities, write millions of lines of code. In short, they are engaged in highly intellectual activities related primarily to the construction of complex objects. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then embarrassment: nature in our brain was not provided for anything for such an activity. The most difficult thing that a monkey had to think in his head was the relationship in the pack. To solve the most complex problems facing the individual, the DSM was intended.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, according to one version, a separate patch for solving complex intellectual problems has not appeared in our brain (yet). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Too little time has passed for serious evolutionary transformations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And all the fantastic achievements of mankind are the result of the work of the DSM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The very DSM, the purpose of which is to think about who can collect fleas from the back, and who should not. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And what happens? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have in our head a system designed to solve the problems of survival in a pack. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Optionally, it can be used to build complex systems and objects, load a large context into the brain, analyze relationships and anticipate the development of a situation for different scenarios. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A multifunctional such system is obtained.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ways of development of the DSM</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now the question is: how is it better to develop it? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a traditional way - more precisely, a way that has become traditional for us - through pumping exactly the optional way to use DSM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And there is a way provided by the DSM developers - through understanding the context of the pack. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, the hypothesis is that for pumping yourself up as an engineer, programmer, analyst, architect, manager, prime minister or even president, it‚Äôs better not to read books, write code, or watch videos, but to delve into the processes of relationships in the pack . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Again, this is a hypothesis.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About my JSM</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Back to me. I‚Äôm not here to show off, but as an object of study. Relations in the pack, I always ignored. As soon as the flock began to climb into my space, one way or another, I just quit my job because I did not want to delve into its device. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then, at one of the works, something changed. In fact, everything was simple - there was a man, the owner, who explained to me the importance of understanding human relations. More precisely, he didn‚Äôt explain, but convinced that it was important, and I believed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And since then he began to observe. Fortunately, that company had a large staff turnover, especially in the management team at all levels. This gave an advantage - it was possible, in fact, to observe several different flocks in a few years. From birth to solemn destruction.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And, what already there - it began to turn out. It turned out that living in a pack is not difficult at all. Then it turned out that moving up the pack is quite simple. The main thing is to understand who is who. Who is alpha, who is his ‚Äúbeloved wife‚Äù, at least for the coming months, who will die on the next hunt, because he burrows too much and jumps on a mammoth, and who should learn from. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then miracles began - I suddenly became faster and better at solving programming, designing, project and people management tasks, organizational changes, etc. All these stories began there, accelerating the work of programmers, ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with the owner, strategic development, etc.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I even got such a function as drawing psychological portraits of managers and employees to order. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps because I began to delve too quickly into the context of not only tasks, but also packs and personalities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, by God, the owner ordered me portraits of all the leaders. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I ordered my own portrait, and then a misfire came out - I overestimated my understanding in the pack, and wrote everything I think, and the relationship went cold. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I still work as a full-time painter of psychological portraits, in great secret, and, of course, I no longer ‚Äúpaint‚Äù my boss.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main tool for the development of DSM</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Important functions of the DSM can also include reflection, that same wandering, playing real and predicted situations in relationships with people. You know how it happens - for example, a conflict situation has appeared, or an episode in which you showed yourself not in the best way. They said the wrong words, they made the wrong emphasis, they explained everything wrong. And then, in private, you lose this situation in your head, in a variety of variations, but with one outcome - so that you are the winner.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is also the work of the DSM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if one removes one‚Äôs beloved from the equation, then such walks will be quite useful for oneself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, if during the day you observe the behavior, actions, words, gestures and facial expressions of people, and in a state of reflection - try to understand what motivates them, what are their true motives, who is friends with whom, and who are with whom - ‚Äúfriends ", Or, as women say, who are friends against whom. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important only to consider situations that are not related to you, otherwise the brain will always lead to the side of personal victory, this is not very useful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will be useful to reflect on fictional characters in the same way, from books, movies and TV shows. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only, of course, not from soap operas, but from quality work.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">John Steinbeck</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Personally, I would recommend reflecting on books by authors such as John Steinbeck - for example, ‚ÄúThe Winter of Our Trouble‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Bunches of Wrath‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wrote essays poorly at school, so now I can be mistaken, but, in my opinion, Steinbeck‚Äôs key ‚Äútrick‚Äù is not to tell what the characters think and are guided by. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He simply sets out the events as they were without getting into the character‚Äôs head, leaving the reader a huge space for imagination. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is its difference from, for example, Dostoevsky, who is not fed with bread, but let me tell you what Raskolnikov is thinking about. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All his motives, concepts of understanding the world and his place in it, and most importantly - the development of these ideas in time - are shown with maximum detail and cause-effect relationships. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Roughly speaking, the reader has nothing to think over - everything is laid out on a silver platter.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Total</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, the hypothesis is clear. If you want to be a cool programmer, analyst, architect, manager, minister, prime minister, president - develop DSM in a natural way for her, i.e. through cognition, understanding and influence on the flock. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The success of most managers, if you look, is connected with the developed DSM. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs always been called differently - ‚Äúrelations with people‚Äù. Who understands and builds relationships with people, i.e. develops JSM, rises higher than those guys who are smart, but no one knows about it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I say right away: I do not say that success is a career and the position of manager, minister or president. In this case, I use the term ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù as moving up the hierarchy in a pack ‚Äî exactly the same way as ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is understood in packs of animals. Surviving and moving higher are two key instincts.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although, perhaps I‚Äôm just pulling an owl on the globe, and this article is the result of my excessively played DSM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not excluded. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, I do not affirm anything, I simply suggest that you look at yourself and your environment from a new perspective. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs probably not going to harm your DSM.</font></font></div>
