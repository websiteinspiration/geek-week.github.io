<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is not the first year that we at the SRI SOKB have been organizing remote access to corporate data from mobile devices and we know that remote work is not an easy issue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Under the cut, we will tell how our solutions help to safely manage mobile devices of employees and why it is important for remote work.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does an employee need to work remotely?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A typical set of services that you need to provide remote access for full work is communication services (e-mail, messenger), web resources (various portals, for example, service desk or project management system) and files (electronic document management systems, version control etc.). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We cannot hope that security threats will wait until we finish fighting the coronavirus. Remote work has its own safety rules that must be observed even during a pandemic.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Information that is important for business cannot simply be sent to an employee‚Äôs personal email, so that the employee can easily read and process it on a personal smartphone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can lose a smartphone, you can install applications that steal information on it, in the end, children who are at home all because of the same virus can play it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So the more important the data the employee is working with, the better they need to be protected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the protection of mobile devices should be no worse than stationary.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why is antivirus and VPN not enough?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For stationary workstations and laptops running Windows, the installation of an antivirus is a justified and necessary measure. But for mobile devices - not always. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Apple device architecture interferes with the communication between applications. This limits the possible scale of the consequences of infected software: if the vulnerability of an email client is used, then actions cannot go beyond the scope of this email client. At the same time, such a policy reduces the effectiveness of antiviruses. Automatically check the file that came by mail, no longer work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the Android platform, both viruses and antiviruses have more prospects. But still the question of expediency arises. To install malware from the application store, you will have to manually give a lot of permissions. Attackers gain access rights only from those users who allow applications everything. In practice, it‚Äôs enough to prohibit users from installing applications from unknown sources so that tablets for free installed paid applications do not ‚Äúcure‚Äù corporate secrets from confidentiality. But this measure goes beyond the functions of antivirus and VPN.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, VPN and antivirus will not be able to control how the user behaves. Logic suggests that at least a password should be set on the user device (as a protection against loss). But the presence of a password and its reliability depend only on the user's consciousness, which the company cannot influence in any way.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, there are administrative methods. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, internal documents, according to which employees will be personally responsible for the lack of passwords on devices, installing applications from untrusted sources, etc. You can even force all employees to sign an amended job description containing these items before going to remote work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But let's face it: the company will not be able to verify how this instruction is executed in practice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She will be busy with urgent restructuring of the main processes, while employees, despite the implemented policies, will copy confidential documents to their personal Google Drive and open access to them by reference, because it is more convenient to work together on a document.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, the sudden remote work of the office is a test for the stability of the company.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Corporate Mobility Management</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From the point of view of information security, mobile devices are a threat and a potential breach in the security system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To close this gap are solutions of the EMM class (enterprise mobility management).&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Corporate mobility management (EMM) includes the functions of managing devices (MDM, mobile device management), their applications (MAM, mobile application management) and content (MCM, mobile content management).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
MDM is a necessary whip. Using MDM functions, an administrator can reset or block a device if it is lost, configure security policies: password availability and complexity, disabling debugging functions, installing applications from apk, etc. These basic features are supported on mobile devices of all manufacturers and platforms. More detailed settings, for example, the prohibition of installing custom recovery, are available only on devices of individual manufacturers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
MAM and MCM are the carrot in the form of applications and services to which they provide access. By providing sufficient security for MDM, you can provide secure remote access to corporate resources using applications installed on mobile devices.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At first glance, it seems that managing applications is a purely IT task, which boils down to elementary operations such as ‚Äúinstall the application, configure the application, update the application to a new version or roll it back to the previous one‚Äù. In fact, here is not without security. It is necessary not only to install and configure the necessary applications for the devices on the devices, but also to protect corporate data from loading into your personal Dropbox or Yandex.Disk.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/km/zw/n3/kmzwn3xrgpuk23_1m11vfk4ru2k.png" width="200"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To separate corporate and personal, modern EMM systems offer to create a container on the device for corporate applications and their data. The user cannot unauthorizedly remove data from the container, so the security service does not need to prohibit ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù use of the mobile device. On the contrary, this is beneficial for business. The more the user understands his device, the more efficiently he will use working tools.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's get back to IT tasks. There are two tasks that cannot be solved without EMM: rollback of the application version and its remote configuration. Rollback is needed when the new version of the application does not suit users - it has serious errors or is simply inconvenient. In the case of applications on Google Play and the App Store, rollback is not possible - only the latest version of the application is always available in the store. With active internal corporate development, versions can be released almost every day, and not all of them are stable.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Remote configuration of applications can be implemented without EMM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, make different builds of the application for different server addresses or save the settings file in the public memory of the phone, then change it manually. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All this is found, but it can hardly be called best practices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In turn, Apple and Google offer standardized approaches to solving this problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is enough for the developer to build in the necessary mechanism once, and the application will be able to configure any EMM.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We bought a zoo!</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not all mobile use cases are equally useful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Different categories of users have different tasks, and they need to be addressed in their own way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The developer and the financier need specific sets of applications and, possibly, sets of security policies due to the different confidentiality of the data they work with.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is not always possible to limit the number of models and manufacturers of mobile devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the one hand, it turns out to be cheaper to make the corporate standard for mobile devices than to understand the differences between Android from different manufacturers and the features of displaying mobile UI on screens of different diagonals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, the purchase of corporate devices in a pandemic is becoming more complicated, and companies have to allow the use of personal devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The situation in Russia is further aggravated by the presence of national mobile platforms that are not supported by Western EMM solutions.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All this often leads to the fact that instead of one centralized solution for managing corporate mobility, a diverse zoo of EMM-, MDM- and MAM-systems is operated, each of which is serviced by its own personnel according to unique rules.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are the features in Russia?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In Russia, as in any other country, there is national legislation on the protection of information, which does not change depending on the epidemiological situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, in state information systems (GIS), protective equipment certified according to safety requirements should be used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To meet this requirement, devices accessing GIS data must be managed using certified EMM solutions, which include our SafePhone product.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d8/zm/mj/d8zmmj7kpbi_9cqzmdmgwyjrqzi.png" width="200"><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Long and incomprehensible? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not really</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Enterprise-level tools, such as EMM, are often associated with slow implementation and lengthy pre-project preparation. Now there is simply no time for this - restrictions due to the virus are being introduced quickly, so there is no time to tune in to remote work.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In our experience, while we have implemented many projects to implement SafePhone in companies of various sizes, even with local deployment, the solution can be launched in a week (not counting the time for negotiating and signing contracts). Ordinary employees will be able to use the system within 1-2 days after implementation. Yes, for flexible product configuration, you need to train administrators, but training can be carried out in parallel with the start of operation of the system.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order not to waste time installing in the customer‚Äôs infrastructure, we offer our customers a cloud-based SaaS service for remote control of mobile devices using SafePhone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, we provide this service from our own data center, which is certified to meet the maximum requirements for GIS and personal data information systems. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
