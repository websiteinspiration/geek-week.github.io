<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hello everyone, thank you for being able to organize this. Eduard Lysenko and his colleagues are in touch with us. Eduard, probably imagine for a start those who decided to phone with us on a zoom basis, and then I will tell you how it all began and how it will go today.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Come on. Lysenko is me, as many probably already know, it means that against the background of bricks we have my deputy who is responsible for the data center infrastructure - their name is Aleksey Mikhailovich Anisimov, against the background, respectively, the blue lock is Aleksey too, but Butov, this is for senior information security, between them is Dmitry (middle name I don’t remember) Ivanov, who is responsible for public services and e-government in Moscow for many, many years. If another person joins, then I will introduce myself.</font></font><br>

If you don’t mind, I would say so that no matter how our acquaintance and our dialogue begin, it would be nice to continue it, at least once in a period of time, and if you do it in this format or any another, if the questions in the live format will be of interest to the community, I am always in favor of [them] left. I think that there is, for example, a question on [inaudible] of 14 pages of one answer, it requires a separate meeting even with you ... Then we will appoint another time in a week, we’ll talk. A masked man joined us, this is Mikhail Mishakov, the only one of us in a tie. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have such an ... informal meeting.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, I can see from the background of your venue, this is a normal story, so I say thanks again for organizing the dialogue, let’s start, have time, let’s do it, continue, set the time and also move. We can start later, at 17:30 it’s dangerous to start with me, it’s just that time is blocked by all kinds of meetings. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">See that there is something to build on, let's probably outline how everything in the department is arranged from the point of view of the development team: are these in-house teams or outsourcing more? Tell us how it works and then we’ll go along the list made up by readers.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are different [teams], we have about 30 areas of such, so-called product lines, by analogy with business, respectively, even now there are even more. Completely own development, generally a full production cycle. Somewhere there is mainly architecture, technical support, project management, of course, analytics, well, that is, the main core of competence from which everything comes. And then we actually outsource the developers with either tasks or outstaffing, everything depends on specific tasks there. Since there is so much going on at the same time, various such methods are used here.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Okay, then we’ll start from here. We probably have the largest category of questions, which we conventionally called “painful”, this mainly concerns the “Social Monitoring” application, there were most of these issues, let's start with them. The main question is what is the whole point of the application, which requires you to send a selfie and generally take some kind of active action to confirm the location, if the location is already tracked using geolocation; if you got in a car and drove somewhere, a camera will see you and so on. Maybe it could be done somehow thinner, more technologically advanced?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Only selfies bother?</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Selfies ... As far as I understand, this was corrected only in May, before they asked for selfies to be sent including at night. When you are sick, it’s bad for you to send a selfie at night, and if you didn’t send it, getting a fine is not fun, agree.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It’s not cool, so we got better, but look, first of all, according to the plan and purpose, if someone remembers how everything developed in February and March, especially at the end of March, only then in April this infection curve went, how it penetrated actively into society and when what managerial decisions were made, self-isolation from the beginning of April and so on. You must imagine that the main task of the city leadership was to minimize the number of social contacts of precisely those people who are diagnosed carriers of the virus, that is, they should be in good faith at home ideally, if this is a mild form; or if in a problem situation there is already a temperature or some kind of developing pneumonia, then move around and be hospitalized. When it comes to those who are at home in this particular time period,and then, relatively speaking, a few hundred such people were added to the day first. Then it came to, if I remember correctly, up to 7 thousand a day, even from the position of the city, we simply do not have the right to sit still and not do anything, it’s just our duty,</font></font><b>        </b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">if this story will develop uncontrollably. In order to prevent this scenario (I don’t know if our viewers and listeners are familiar, this is the Italian, New York scenario, when the city did nothing, it didn’t do anything in Italy and when the trucks with corpses were there), you need to make efforts so that the person is in place. We studied about 16 different applications. In general, different people studied the means, probably one of the directions could be the introduction of some tough measures: not to be let out, troops to be let out or something like that, but as a result, we made decisions to limit as much as possible from contacts with if possible, by such sick (technical means) healthy people who walk on the streets and, accordingly, social monitoring was born from an analysis of these applications.There were the most extreme options, for example, in South Korea, the software that they made back in the previous epidemic and developed all these two years, he generally collects transactions from them, tracks - whatever he collects about a person. And people have no way to refuse this, moreover, he even shows these people on a map! Imagine for a second, if [we began] to show really the person who got sick on a public map, like they have in Seoul. This is a totally unacceptable story for our mentality. Or, for example, Qatar, where for going out into the street for three years a man is sent to prison (kovidny accordingly). Or there’s another option like Israel, where they simply legitimately monitor people. That is, what only law enforcement bodies do in our country, it is directly registered in the software. We chose the optionwhich, on the one hand, would allow a person to exercise some self-discipline, on the other hand, be sure that the person is at the quarantine address where the doctor brought him. In order for this address to be documented, that is, in a resolution that he signs himself, so that he signs as much as possible under those provisions that he must consciously observe. I mean that "yes, I am in place, yes, I am sick and must be in place for 14 days" - this is an indication of Rospotrebnadzor, and it’s as if in the end it’s easy to take and not spread the disease. And at the same time you need to make sure that the person is in place.so that he subscribes to the maximum under those provisions that he consciously must observe. I mean that "yes, I am in place, yes, I am sick and must be in place for 14 days" - this is an indication of Rospotrebnadzor, and it’s as if in the end it’s easy to take and not spread the disease. And at the same time you need to make sure that the person is in place.so that he subscribes to the maximum under those provisions that he consciously must observe. I mean that "yes, I am in place, yes, I am sick and must be in place for 14 days" - this is an indication of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and human trafficking, as it were, in the end, just to take and not spread the disease. And at the same time you need to make sure that the person is in place.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If someone is in crowdsourcing right now, by the way, I spoke at Echo and now I just would like to announce, you can even propose an idea. If you come up with how to make sure that a person is located, and not his SIM card is in this place. Many errors with the application and fines, including canceled, were due to the fact that someone gives the phone, or the phone incorrectly enters. It is the man in the place where he is. Who is this man? Actually, the only thing we can take is his photo. Therefore, this very simple functionality was invented, proceeding exactly from these considerations, proceeding from analysis plus proceeding from this story. If someone comes up with a more subtle story - Wellcomes are actually ready to even tell you how to get a startup grant through an innovation cluster.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, Edward, but look at the story: in the comments under that post we rightly noticed that you can do these selfies in advance and send them.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Impossible. There are events that are randomly generated now in the daytime. Look, I [use social monitoring] from the first day of the app’s application, I just don’t have another ... I get about five on average a day of pushes, plus a few days ago we did sms, they are clearer. We worked on SMS functionality for about a week, for sure this whole week. No, a little earlier, last week. I go here, take a photo for 15 seconds and end this story, everything, I forgot about the phone. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the main complaint was, of course, at the time at which [request] comes ...</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Time, yes, we had a nuance on the first version on the Android version: it was generated by us, according to the standard it was possible at any time, but you know, when you work 24/7, here are all the people you see here, in this row They work and their teams work 24/7 from the moment when it all started with us, this is about mid-January. I don’t know who, as I noticed, when COVID came to Moscow, in reality it was mid-late January. When China made its first announcement, actually COIVD was already here. And yes, not all of us can make super cool right away, unfortunately. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, but still this is a fair question and righteous anger, understand? Why did it take months to fix this annoying thing? Maybe if it weren’t for this, it wouldn’t have bombed like that?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, they fixed it in two days, the android version was released in the store on about April 27 or 28, on the 29th there were pushies and on the 30th we copied, re-published. There were two days in total, or rather two nights. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, then another question: you say that the team works 24/7 (I hope that people still sleep). Tell us about the team, how big is the team working on such an application?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now this application, together with all the volunteers who code, is explained to people, several hundred people work a day with the call center. That is, today, for example, we had one of the infrequent situations when 0 people were generally in line at the call center for almost the entire day. Oh, on the other hand, we had about 350 operators who were waiting for calls, this is only the first line.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if we talk only about the developers?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The developers of about 30 people. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These 30 people work 24/7, a complex product that is made in a short time. When did you arrive (and from whom, incidentally, it is interesting) such a task, and in what time period did you need to develop such an application?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, they were developing the first version for about 3 weeks from the beginning of April, and the task is not that ... A forecast was made for the development of infection (almost got into it actually) that there would be a sharp surge in late April, and by the end of April it was necessary to come up with something that which will help to maintain discipline, at least for those who have to sit at home, to light patients. By the way, you know, in fact there are people, of course, who are unhappy, screaming and so on, but in fact, almost everyone uses them in good faith [“Social Monitoring”]. A lot of people who are completely calm, like me, click five times a day (3 to 5 notifications are sent by the system). All these developers, all marketers and all the people who are connected with this, they also have android versions there and so on, all the testers actually work. Therefore, you need to be calm about this,because there are things that need to be done in such a period. This is a difficult situation, for us it is generally like a military situation, because, indeed, there are many events that never happened anywhere.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tell me, did you say before that they were mainly outsourcing teams, didn’t in-house work on social monitoring?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Both those and those are. This is mainly in-house, but we use coding if necessary. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Value maybe? These are just such everyday questions [of readers] - it is not known how this works and why.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you need to expand a programming resource, we expand it through outsourcing. Well, as you usually buy programmers, that's all. So often do. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Okay, then there is another question: people are interested in what kind of background these specialists have, where they come from, what kind of outsourcers they are, where do they go then?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You know me ...</font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">... for two weeks now they’ve been trying to hack all my accounts in all services in which I’m not. They send a lot of SMS messages for repeated two-factor authorization, if those who are now in the audience are doing this, you will stop, please. I do not have these services, sometimes I delete 100 cm. Oh well ...</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
... in general, the corresponding background. If it’s an app-based application, respectively, it’s mobile developers, the backend is spinning on different technologies, we have mostly open-source, for almost three years we have practically removed it ... Here, in general, open-source. According to android, well, android developers, normal developers. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So you will not name a specific team?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, now I won’t call, then they will start trolling, something else ... People work, they understand what they are doing, they do it with the maximum quality that is possible in such a short time, this must be respected, this is normal. I’m a programmer myself, I’ve programmed that way, I understand that there are different situations, you don’t need to do such things. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, since there was a talk, there was another question for you personally: when did you write your last code yourself and what?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I wrote normal code a long time ago, somewhere in 2004-2005, it was C ++, I specialized in network programming. Plus, stories related to ATMs, as he once worked in a bank and was a system administrator. And accordingly, since then nothing has happened, apart from the fact that when I accidentally got to the hospital, I programmed a bit on python, there was free time. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then we go further. Tell us about the average and median salaries of developers.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
... everyone sends me sms ...</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So look, I won’t give absolute numbers, I’ll tell you so that we have the price of people inside, because we have all the people who are built. The department is a government body, we have a restriction for civil servants there, and all civil servants are visible on the declaration. There is a state government agency, where we mainly have people located. In our country, just to make it clear, in public institutions the salary is always lower than the market. Taking into account all the opportunities, we keep about 20-25% of the market there, and basically the people who work ... Well, that is, the one who works for wages can work in business, there are no questions. Those who remain here are people who are associated with some serious competence. I’m not talking about coding now, because this, of course, is a serious competency, but from the point of view of creating the system as a whole,especially when your tasks go from year to year, it is a matter of keeping such a center of competence as a team in the long run. These people are motivated not only with money, they are motivated to really implement the plan, which is proved, needed, tested, this applies to all long stories with public services, services and so on, and this motivation is much more important for people who work with this side. Here, everyone has their own choice, you can go into business, get 30% more, maybe even more if it is a management link, but then you make money, you work for profit and something else, but at least in state projects you you will see only a piece of it. Or you work from here and you try to do everything.These people are motivated not only with money, they are motivated to really implement the plan, which is proved, needed, tested, this applies to all long stories with public services, services and so on, and this motivation is much more important for people who work with this side.

This is mainly outsourcing, of course, this is such a specific marketing ... I’ll tell you this, it's like design, you see, there’s a designer who keeps the same style, and for a while people like it, even inside, even in presentations like this style . But sometimes it is necessary to juggle this matter, therefore, such things should definitely be attracted from the market, this is a much more effective resource, as well as, for example, a resource associated with some deep technological knowledge, specific knowledge that we do not use every day, let’s say so. Here are sociologists there, psychologists are the same story, which is connected with the understanding of a certain audience or something else, we always attract it from the outside.

comment right away.

The fact is that the question here is not who is responsible for the GPS not working - the person must be in place anyway, the mat should certainly be where he wrote, and it is advisable not to deceive even when I signed documents, this also unfortunately happened ... why do people act like that, they want to be fooled and try to deceive people like life hacks - well, there must probably be some kind of inner different life position than for example how I feel about it. With us, you know, everyone lives in that state and in the country where we live, and I think that you understand that we are responsible for any of our actions. In this case, in particular,established liability is a regulatory document for this particular period. The period is not long, two months, if you get sick, you just need to comply, and such funds, even if there is a mistake, even if there was a penalty, in any case, we are all considering with the main control, they are all if it’s of minor importance or something else something, recall.

One hundred percent evidence is probably not my quote, I did not say that.

There is no 100% clear evidence, but there is always some evidence.

I’ve already made an endless amount of video calls with this closet over the past two months, because I’m practically not at home, I’m here where I am.

And this, sorry, is not for me. We have a code of administrative offenses, and the Moscow City Duma and the federal Duma adopted during the April raises and infections. I think it’s clear where it came from, from a common understanding that if this goes on, then, generally speaking, it will be bad on the streets of the country, not like the city; by the way, the country continues to gain momentum, if anything, it's all here, as it were tired and want to walk, and it’s understandable.

I agree, I do not argue, I mean that in this sense I do not dispute the situation, I agree that this is a terrible story for everyone, but the infection is growing so far and mortality is still not falling. And God forbid that everything was good. Now, if we return to fines for a second, we have a whole study, they showed it on TV. I don’t know whether people who are sitting on the Internet watching TV or not are unlikely, but at least they can see broadcasts and google, for example, fines in other countries for such things that we think are fantastic here.

[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, I don’t have one. This is the main control in our country that leads these stories, but I think that we need to rely on the numbers that they gave, there were 57,000 fines last week, but I think there’s more now, of course. But in general, I can say ... The main problem is in this story: people do not have enough information, we understand this, of course, but it’s impossible to distribute everything there so quickly, and the landing page was recently released completely, and there people who are volunteers are walking right now specifically tell help install there and so on, it's all not easy. Because volunteers are also scared, especially scared of coveted patients, no one wants to get infected. This is when you sit there somewhere far away at home, it seems to you that it is so ... when you really go to people who are sick or know people whose someone has died, it looks very different.And it’s not so simple to actually organize all these processes. Therefore, this is a complicated story. Gradually, including due to the negative of this surge, maybe many found out there [about the application], and this significantly added users who live normally and significantly reduced the number of violations, oddly enough it could be so, but and therefore, in general, the percentage of fines it somehow grows there, but I did not hear from the main control that there were some transcendental things.strange as it may be, it should be so, but therefore, in general, the percentage of fines is somehow growing there, but I have not heard from the main control that there are some transcendent things.strange as it may be, it should be so, but therefore, in general, the percentage of fines is somehow growing there, but I have not heard from the main control that there are some transcendent things.</font></font><br>

We looked at this question, thank you for sending it in advance, we can imagine this situation with difficulty, because this person must move for some purpose himself, which means, accordingly, if a person himself knows how to move around the city, then the probability that he has no means of communication is practically no, but even if he cannot call, relatively speaking, from a neighbor, then probably someone is who helps him, but honestly this is a very critical situation. We have been living there with these passes since April 13, for every one there was, yes, there was some getting used to it and this is also a non-standard story for everyone, but there are no such issues in real life, they just don’t exist, that is, if a person cannot do it [pass]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
he himself means someone helps him necessarily, or a social worker, by the way, they no less selflessly than the doctors continued to go all the time to help their wards and still continue, and they deliver some kind of firewood and carry medicine, they help everyone, we are They are constantly in touch, our volunteers go help.

There's a different decision sequence, Ivan. When a person is diagnosed with a situation, already our employees fell into this and went through all these cycles and communications, and so on, the first decision that a person makes is whether he is ready to go for an observation or not, if he has a light form. We are now talking only about the mild form, because when the form is severe, there are no options there, the person is hospitalized and thank God that in Moscow, despite all these screams by mid-May, especially, despite these peaks, there were still enough places for hospitalization and they didn’t lie in other regions or other countries in the corridors, and so on. If the person is in a light form, the first choice that he makes is to go to the observant, now the procedure is already softening there, and the observation is the place where you will just live on government grubs for two weeks.Somehow they will be watching you, but it’s real, since the light form, until the temperature rises, in general, you will simply eat and sleep there. Probably there is a TV I do not know. Or to stay at home, but if you stay at home, then you have to accept certain conditions and this was written directly in the documents. The documents were of different levels of maturity and old age, somewhere it was more clearly prescribed, somewhere less, but the decree did not change, according to which all these rules acted. And in the decree all this was clearly spelled out in 3-4 paragraphs.

There are so-called outliers of positioning points, for example, they must be leveled all the time, otherwise a person will get a bunch of failures and get a lot of fines. Therefore, the algorithm is complex there, it takes into account many factors, including your colleagues there who asked the right questions related to the time factor, the time factor is also taken into account, that is, this does not mean that this is just not a one-time reset of the point, but it should be time-out from a certain radius that is fixed at the address of self-isolation.</font></font><br>

hours of course ... Let’s still we will not disclose the algorithm that we use inside the information system, but the grandson’s case is completely understandable, it uses a special system for changing geo-coordinates, that is, their substitution. Naturally, if we all have these coordinates ... </font></font><br>

Wait please, I just got a push like that, see? You can see that the push has come, the application is working, and sms has come ... Listen, stop bombing me with unnecessary sms, who is bombing there. Here's another link came. Accordingly, here’s all I do is press the button “take a photo”, then he tells me to take the right position, excellent, take a photo, send a photo.

[MM]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Good. Let's not open the algorithm, there are certain features, but in case if the coordinate really goes to grandchild or there are some other outliers of the point, they can be individually considered in any case because we store this logging for later consideration with citizens and there are cases when we are those fines that are for automatically violations that are automatically set, we including them revoked when people spoke</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"I was not there, please understand." We lifted archives, looked at the logs and calmly said that this was a technical feature of a particular territory and, relatively speaking, these violations were canceled in a quiet mode without any problems there. That is, everything that is incorrectly displayed is everything in the dialogue and now every day we look at these cases because Moscow really, who knows how the Yandex navigator works, that it brings this point all the time along the road, otherwise it would dance there all the time plus or minus 20 meters in Moscow, and actually we are calmly considering this, we will cancel violations if there are any problems. But the algorithm is widespread, we have good experience in photography just, the algorithm works quite clearly, so no massive complaints have been recorded right now. They are, we process them,but not mass.</font></font><br>

We were issued with two types of devices: huawei y5 2018-2019 and nokia 1, that is, they are the simplest smartphones, they are actually certified by Rostest for sale in the Russian Federation, they were provided to us by telecom operators and we gave these smartphones with sim With the cards provided by the city, all the operators were involved in this: the megaphone, and the MTS, and the Beeline, and Tele2, and, as a matter of fact, issued them to users. Users first install the application, and use it if they don’t have a smartphone. Despite the fact that we tested these smartphones in advance to ensure that the application works correctly there, I can say that our employees in the department have about 25-25 phones distributed, which we give out to residents, and they also go through identification every day, look for errors and give feedback to developers</font></font><br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well thank you. Here's another thing that people care about: why city servers do not have an open API, and why are access requests for this API usually denied? What does it mean about services, and not about access to data, these are two different things.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[meets Dmitry Ivanov]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Good afternoon, here we are probably talking about APIs not of servers, but applications and the possibility of receiving some kind of advertising services in third-party applications, we started this practice and in fact, as part of the pass system, we did not give the general public, but we gave such an API to a number of third-party applications. A clear example is our API for checking passes, taxi cabs use it for sure if one of you went to Yandex taxi, then taxi drivers asked you to check the pass and scanned the QR code with your application and saw if the pass was valid or not valid. As part of our ecosystem, we also issue this API, for example, the Moscow Transport application was launched today, in which they also made it possible to obtain a one-time pass, it all twitches through the API. While the API is used, well, let's say, in internal projects, but we are preparing forto give out our city services to external environments for general use.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's about organizations. And if I want to make a conditional application of my dreams that works using your services, can I contact and get access or not?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[DI]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It all depends on the application and the service, because when such a question comes up, most often we are talking about the so-called electronic services of electronic services, and there are some simple services, for example, checking a taxi license, which I just took, pushed and saw the result, it’s you can really embed it in various applications, but there are quite complex services and not all of the business logic can be implemented at the API level, but at the same time, since the city as a whole is responsible for the quality and result of the service, we cannot give this API fully , because part of the requirements are implemented both at the API level and part is implemented on the front side. Naturally, all this is solved, at the level of requirements, at the level of an agreement on interactions. We are going to this, I repeat, and I think in the near future we will begin to share such APIs.Technically, we are ready for this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, technically, a lot of work has been done over the past two and a half years, we have essentially transferred well systems of this type to a microservice platform, so our overall trend is of course there. It’s another matter that Dmitry correctly said, and we faced this earlier, while business is guided by its own interests and rarely, so to speak, by the interests of the state, to say the least. It is very rare for the interests of the state that the junction goes on, is it a socially oriented service or is it a more monetized service for them. All, of course, are guided by monetized stories with flows like fines there, of this type. You see, we can’t afford it, we must give maximum services for a person at the endpoint. If, relatively speaking,the front that wants to come to us through the API and do good for itself because it either receives traffic for itself, or tasty services, while in response it is not ready to do anything, or is ready to do it, but with a significant delay, then the question is, actually why such front, and this is actually the main discussion. Technically, this question is understandable that it is possible to implement, but now every business considers this point in its own way. Someone says some services, I’m ready to take the load and, reducing the profitability of my main service due to your flow, take over. Someone is not ready, but so far so globally everyone is only guided by what they want to pick up, and not by what, a person should generally be given, even taking into account our statistics on socially oriented services. Therefore, this is not a technical issue. With all due respect,it is not a question of the level of technological maturity of the habr, the specialists of the people who are sitting here. This is a question of the ideology of this mission, if you will, in the end, of those or other fronts that the potential partners of the city make. Therefore, here we are somehow moving. Technical on this platform, we are able to do this and do it with those who fit into such designs organizationally.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's continue a little more about the API. If you remember, at the very beginning I lamented that it would be possible to make everything finer, without the need for pictures and all that. First: have you heard about the existence of APIs from Google and Apple that build social links between infected and non-infected based on GPS and Bluetooth? They opened this API. Have you considered using such a thing? And if they finally came to the decision not to use, why?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Do we know about this? Yes, we know everyone reads the news. This is exactly what google and apple did after it did not fly in the form in which it was declared, in the Singapore application trench together. Because a beautiful good mission was dying due to the fact that the application simply did not communicate with other phones on the screen off. Accordingly, if someone reads the specification of this service, of those who listen to us, who wrote the question, they could see the version of which operating system on this or that vendor it is supported. We just had such questions, why did our social work with the sixth version of the android and ... Since the 9th version of iOS and that we are not covering people enough. In fact, according to the statistics that we collected there from both google and apple, we thus covered about 90% of potential users in Moscow.If we look at the specification of this service that Google and Apple announced, if I’m not mistaken, a couple of weeks ago, then there is a tag in apple, I don’t remember which [version of Android]. This is certainly a cool thing, probably, it is very convenient for manufacturers, for vendors. Thus, now everyone who has updated, everyone is distributing their encrypted keys of their mac addresses to all the devices around, which means, but it certainly does not solve the problems associated with the task that the social community is solving. Well, just doesn’t physically solve it. There is another important point that needs to be understood, it is already connected with those people ... People who read the license agreement for this service, probably they could see that such a service can be implemented only for one application in the country.Of course, Moscow can make the only application of social monitoring for the whole country, whether it needs to be done for the whole country is a separate issue, therefore, especially considering the first factor, the second factor is less restraining, but the first factor, when the problem is not solved, and at the same time it’s just conditionally speaking to stimulate sales of newer versions of Apple and Google hardware in order to upgrade to these operating systems ... Well, probably, the vendor is solving its problem correctly. But from the point of view, the task of combating the spread of coronavirus is not completely correlated things. Although the idea is cool.when the problem is not solved and at the same time it’s just conditionally speaking about stimulating sales of newer versions of Apple and Google hardware in order to upgrade to these operating systems ... Well, the vendor probably solves his problem correctly. But from the point of view, the task of combating the spread of coronavirus is not completely correlated things.

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
[MM] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I’ll fix it a bit, it doesn’t use GPS technology, it uses Bluetooth (BLE) and there is no "jeepies" there, they prohibit it in the license agreement. That is, there are only bluetooth tracks that are stored on the server and the user must confirm it himself when he gets sick, that is, it is like a message, that is, no one forces him and no one searches for him there. If he himself confirms and sends that he is ill, the server will push “you are in contact” to everyone.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in the current situation, no one forces anyone in general. It's all at the mercy of common sense. Tell me this thing: this is also my personal pain, because I tried the third day to find out if I can walk, and when to walk, and where is this radius of two kilometers, and all that. I went to mos.ru, there was a wonderful message saying that "everything is ready, look when you can go for a walk." But something did not take off, did not start, I enter my address - nothing happens. I poke into my house - nothing happens. The question is very simple: do you load test new products?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course we produce. But it’s all the same ... We’re not Yandex, when 8 million people come in at the same time to see where is the address of the walk, although everyone says “well, why this schedule, nobody needs it, and we want it without a schedule”, and then a couple of millions in an hour ... Then you found your schedule? </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was a bit inconsistent, because on the desktop version it has one look, in a mobile application it is a kind of chat with some bot that I personally didn’t want to talk to at all - I wanted a map. As a result, of course, I found it. But did I feel angry for 10 minutes? Of course.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No need to be angry. Moreover, you are a specialist who understands that ... </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, how it is not necessary, I am also a person, not only a specialist.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everything is simple. The My Moscow application is, in principle, built using chat bot technology; for those who love chatbots, this is the very thing. As for the high-loaded services, it was true that mos.ru had a million calls at a time for a map service; it is not very adapted. But here, thank God, both Yandex and 2GIS were published, and everything can be seen freely there.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, with regard to consistency. Well, yes, it could have been possible, if we had been preparing for this, I don’t know, since January, probably, we would have done it all better, and that would have been normal. Unfortunately, I say again, believe it, don’t believe it, but the people who are sitting here and the teams behind them are people who also faced this. Also, at about the same time when we released releases, a few days before. This is all done like this, openshift'e constantly spinning one release after another, and accordingly physically everything that they could - they did everything. And in principle, when two million people tried (then stopped trying), everything went away and for non-Internet users up to 50 or how many thousands of these posters were printed in advance so that everything would beat along with the Internet. And everywhere all the prefectures hung [these posters],so that there are no problems with understanding infographics.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will take advantage of the situation and ask another question that only concerns me perhaps: why should I know about the existence of 6 groups [for walking] and what will it give me?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is a good, right question. The answer to this question arises when you do not know who else is walking. People asked on “tricks” who have nothing to do with this at all: “How is it that I won’t know when my neighbor is walking? I want to understand, because it’s dishonest if I don’t know when my neighbor is walking! ” Means in the next house. </font></font><br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Okay, but here is my feedback: I would have hidden it a little deeper, because it is simply confusing at first. Let's get back to the issue of loading. Many people are interested in how often you are attacked, whether they are attacked at all, and do you use services to protect against DDoS attacks like Qrator, which, for example, we use?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Alexey, let’s tell you as a whole, but you don’t have to talk about the services we are protecting everywhere </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
[Alexey Butov enters]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, we are constantly attacked, which cannot be impossible, because our portals are publicly accessible and everyone goes there. Therefore, attacks occur every day, sometimes several times a day. But if you look at the statistics, then from the beginning of this year, parts of ddos ​​have attacked us several hundred times there. But it’s I who take such significant attacks that could have consequences if appropriate remedies were not taken. In terms of attacks on web applications, they are also [attacked], they are constantly and every day. If we consider some statistics - what and how - then basically these are, of course, DDoS attacks, because they are the easiest to implement, they are cheap, there are a lot of services for selling these attacks, and when the main goal is to do them system unavailable.The second largest attacks are the selection of some credentials on our portals in order to compromise the goal, to seize user data. In a lower priority, attacks that are already aimed at unauthorized use: SQL injections, XSS attacks and more.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If for DDoS attacks, what size attacks are we talking about? How much traffic?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[Ab]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From several hundred megabits and higher. The statistics are inconsistent, that is, everything depends on time, on the stars in the sky, desire, on the actualization of certain teams that are trying to work not only against us, that is, it can be directed entirely at the industry, entirely at the region, at Russia and etc. Now the background for attacks is much higher than it was in the same period a year ago: this is, of course, associated with current events in the fight against coronavirus. In terms of protection, I won’t tell you specific means, but the protection system in our country is being built in several echelons. Starting with equipment and security equipment that are at the provider level, and ending, respectively, with our security equipment, which is also used along the entire route of traffic, and security equipment in the information systems themselves. Thatwhat did you say about Qrator and other cloud technologies: from the point of view of “normative”, we should use certified plus import-substituted means, therefore cloud technologies are not really about “state” and not really about us.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What if Russian cloud technologies?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[AB] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Great. You yourself know that for Qrator to work, it needs to give a certificate. We are not ready to give a certificate to decrypt traffic to anyone else's hands, except ours. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps, on a tangent, a little to the topic of audit: do you have your own Bug Bounty program, search for some bugs, errors?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[Ab]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I won’t say what exactly Bug Bounty is, but the application security analysis program exists. Moreover, it is, let’s say, built of several levels, but again we will return to the legislation: necessarily one of the stages of building a system of protection and certification of a system is the analysis of the security of this information system. It is carried out by the FSTEC licensees, whom we use to conduct certification of information systems. There is a second level of security analysis: these are targeted pentests of specific information systems, which we also conduct on a periodic basis. This is a more creative process, which is not quite regulated as in the certification process, now there are white hackers who are trying to touch our information system from the point of view of real security from all sides.And we carry out such an analysis on a periodic basis both for existing systems and before the conclusion of information systems in production. Or before the release of any release of information systems in production. This is a constant process, several teams work on it. I will not name the personalities, but in principle there all the Russian teams that are somehow connected with the pentest are more or less significant, they participated or are participating in our projects. At the same time, we try to rotate the team so that there is no stagnation. Because, as I said, this is a creative process, so what one team has found or not found can be found by another team. Therefore, if according to the information system one team of pentesters first went there, then the second team of pentesters, which can find something, will do a second check.that the first team has not yet found. All significant vulnerabilities are fixed in a certain time, depending on the criticality, importance and so on. That is, it is laid in the development of information systems, including a certain SLA to eliminate the found vulnerabilities of developers.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This, as I understand it, is about some planned activity. If an enthusiast decides to feel your security, some lonely pentester, then where should he send such information if he suddenly finds a bug, or vulnerability? And who will consider his application, and will he not receive any responsibility for the fact that he felt your safety? From, of course, the kindest considerations.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[Ab]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Look, we don’t have a Bug Bounty program yet. Perhaps we will come to it after some time, because the question is very delicate from the legislative point of view. Enthusiasts also treat understanding of information systems with understanding, because it also sometimes brings [benefit]. Here, again, there is also a fine line between legislation. That is, any this action, if it was not authorized by us, falls under the requirements of at least the administrative code of offenses. Naturally, we take this with an understanding that if the system was not harmed, and as a result, no pentest was planned there, the system did not fall, just something was found, we will gratefully use this information. If the system in the process of this illegal, so to speak, pentest was damaged, naturally, to the one who did it,will have to answer in accordance with the requirements of the law. Because any pentest that we carry out (precisely planned) is carried out in a limited period of time - usually during a period of unavailability of systems or a confident low availability of the system under the supervision of technical support teams, so that in this case, if the vulnerability found leads to degradation of the system, restore the system in the shortest possible time.It would be possible to restore the system to work as soon as possible.It would be possible to restore the system to work as soon as possible.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is what people really care about. The question sounds like this (he was asked one way or another in different ways several times): why are projects that are sponsored with budget money not public, including a code? I would like to look at the terms of reference, roadmaps.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The terms of reference are all on the public procurement website, there is nothing hidden there. We physically cannot hide this, even if someone wanted to. As for the code: the source code is completely stored in version control systems inside, as belonging to the city. As for “making open-source from it or not doing it”, we don’t do it and usually pass the code to some state bodies if necessary, because there is a right to it under the budget code and so on. And so we simply do not have the right to distribute the code. That is, here you need to do some special model when using, if you somehow give the source. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So you don’t think this way?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We haven’t thought about it yet, but the idea is interesting, because at least in some services at the microservice level you probably could have done something like this, they posted the code on github for voting, it’s clear that what lies there on the blockchain is fair weekend, it all lies in this grid, so please, you can take it, but so basic is the story that needs to be changed normatively in general. Now we have what belongs to the state, should be with the state. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such a ... philosophical question. Okay, do you use any open source solutions?</font></font></b><br>

Let me tell you. Probably the most understandable example is how an electronic service is created. Not only does DIT create services, our team always has together with DIT the so-called [inaudible] - this is education, health, construction, and so on. Anyone who understands business processes, as well as our colleagues, we in the Moscow government have a separate body, a committee of public services, and there are separate "sums" that deal with the methodology for presenting services in electronic form. In fact, they give us the upper level of technical requirements with the requirements of the business process, it is advisable not just to convert the paper process into electronic, but to make it convenient. Accordingly, we get this business statement, representatives of DIT, analysts, participate in its development, if there is time, if there is an opportunity,we are trying to test that business logic and the user path that is proposed, developed and so on.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Often, we run into some kind of legislative restrictions and cannot make it really comfortable, but still try to make it convenient. Actually, when the production was finalized, we begin the standard design stage. We already have a fairly large number of developments, a typical system architecture, and we essentially add up the majority of services or services from those cubes that already exist. We further decompose the designed solutions according to the teams that need to run this product. Basically, this is a front-line team, which is engaged in either an interactive form on the portal or the implementation of services in mobile phones, this is an integration layer and this is the back-end part, in fact a departmental system in which the main business logic takes place. Decomposed, agreed on the timing, went for revision,returned to debugging and integration testing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After all the teams have developed their parts, we meet on integration testing, when it is all assembled on a test environment, we already conduct a series of tests, then we drive to the preprod. And when all the organizational components are ready (because launching a service is not only filling up, but also preparing government employees to provide services in a new way. To prepare users somewhere, to develop some kind of information materials for this), when everything is ready , roll in the prod. In general, this is a fairly standard story. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And more specifically, if at the stage of discussion / receipt of the terms of reference you understand that the task cannot be completed in the desired time frame, can you simply say “no” or adjust the time frame? How does this moment happen?</font></font></b><br>

I think many of us participated in various projects and understand that it is always different. Somewhere you can move the deadline, and indeed, we come to our functional customer and say: “Listen, you came up with a cool idea, we don’t have time to do it, because 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's move the deadlines.” Where circumstances allow, we adjust the terms, adjust the plan, but there are services or, for example, school services where September 1 is, you cannot move it anywhere and you have to agree there, or adjust the business setting, simplify something in order to be in time for target date.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thank. Friends, as I understand it, our hour and a half came out, and I read the comments in a chat room on YouTube in parallel. We are doing our best to add deeper technical specialists to such a Zoom-phoning. And at the very beginning, Edward offered to transfer all unspoken answers to the next time. Therefore, I have this offer, only today and only now. How do you look at making the next call even more open (if it takes place at all) and inviting there not only me, because I am not deeply immersed in technical issues? I write well, but I can very badly code. Accordingly, if we invite specific representatives of our community, are you ready for another meeting?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL]</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, of course, invite, otherwise they trolled you there, they consider that you already work with us almost for money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People don’t know that you issued an ultimatum to me that if I don’t go on the air at 17:30, then there will be no meeting with the community at all. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, yes, because simply ...</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
[EL] </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, okay, there are no questions, it’s clear here. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, it turns out that this time is all, I'm sorry that I'm not cool enough in hardcore programming stuff. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps I could ask more tricky questions, but I found this way out of the situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was said live, so we are waiting for the next post from DIT, tell me when you are ready, as I understand it, the community is always ready.</font></font></b><br>
