      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/company/lanit/blog/496236/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the dollar soared in 2014 and the country headed for import substitution, I had to replace the old team of external testers, paid in dollars, with the new one, paid in rubles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this article I will tell you in detail how we organized this transition process, what difficulties we encountered, how they were solved and what economic effect we got.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a64/7aa/42b/a647aa42b3ae20d24b8f9d7f8ecb7ad0.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did the need for outsourcing testing come about?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have been working at LANIT for 13 years. At first, the testing volumes in my department were small, and I could combine testing 2-3 small projects. Then there were new customers and projects used </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">for</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ng bigger scale, and I started to burst. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Just at that moment, a company came out to offer us outsourcing testing. Its main specialization was testing, employees were relatively inexpensive compared to experienced testers from Moscow, but despite this, settlements had to be made in dollars. We began to work together and grew together as tasks on projects became more complicated, shared our experience, and I learned a lot from my partners.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But in 2014 there was a crisis, the dollar soared in a very short time from 32 to 50 rubles, then to 70, and at peak reached about 90 rubles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such a rise in the dollar directly affected the cost of outsourcing employees.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are looking for "ruble" testers</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, at the same time, the country's leadership set a course for import substitution of foreign software. Import substitution was also required in testing, since the teams involved in outsourcing were not Russian, and mutual settlements in dollars quickly scooped up the entire testing budget. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Due to the increase in the number of projects in the department, the question arose of expanding the testing teams. The needs of the department for testing specialists could no longer be provided in full by our dollar contractor and we had to look for options for cooperation with other companies. The situation with the growth of the dollar even more quickly pushed us to search for partners in the Russian market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Along with import substitution, new challenging tasks also came. It was necessary to find companies on the Russian market that provide testing outsourcing services with high quality work and the ability to quickly scale up, since the testing needs in our department were constantly growing, the package of projects was expanding and it was necessary to find “ruble” testers that would satisfy our needs as soon as possible requests.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We began to research the market, interviewed colleagues, including those working in other companies, asked for recommendations, held a huge number of meetings with different companies. As a result, those were found who corresponded to our requests for competencies and with whom we were ready to work in the Russian market. Most importantly, they were ready to sell us not just testers, but a range of services.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then, preliminary calculations of costs, terms of import substitution were carried out, a work plan was drawn up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the approval of the import substitution plan by the director of the department and the project manager, work began with Russian teams, their leadership, discussion of the terms of cooperation and my requirements for the team and the quality of work.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Growing frames</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The service, which was very important for us, was the ability to quickly grow testers from interns. Of course, these services were provided by the old dollar partners and we did not have a question about the quality of services, the question was their cost and our need to reduce costs. Our new partners had internship programs, competent coaches, a psychologist, a competent HR specialist and quickly found, taught and implemented people invisibly into the project. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When these people completed an internal internship, they showed them to me for an interview. If the immersion in the project, knowledge of testing theory and the implementation of practical tasks on the project were "excellent", we took them to our project team.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And so the team was assembled, and I was convinced that the new contractor is reliable, independently closes many activities in working with personnel (training, implementation in the project (by agreement it was a minimum of two weeks training at the expense of the contractor), motivation, assistance in solving problems, professional programs development), guarantees contractual relations the stability of rates in rubles in the long term, and also demonstrates customer loyalty. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now it remains to solve the most difficult task - to replace more expensive specialists with cheaper ones without losing quality.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We form a set of metrics</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, the goal was clear - to replace the team, maintain the quality, the existing process, good relations with the previous contractor, with whom we worked at that time for about five years. The realities of the business are such that it required changes, concessions, flexibility on both sides for the sake of long-term cooperation. While the management of the department and our long-standing partners were trying to look for options on how to continue cooperation in the new economic conditions, the question arose before me: how will we measure quality in order to understand whether it has become better / worse or everything is stable. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In parallel with the process of import substitution, the production process in the department on large projects grew and improved. Therefore, the issue of quality control on a regular basis was especially relevant for us during this period.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To begin with, it was necessary to understand the “total temperature” of the project, what we have for a certain period and what we can measure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Metrics were taken over the past six months, since this is a rather long period for which there have not been any global changes in the composition of the working teams of analytics, development and testing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such metrics were as relevant as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We were able to measure indicators in the work of the current team, as well as indicators in the context of the project. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Team performance was measured monthly by the Jira bug tracker. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main ones were:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">number of registered defects&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">how many of them are closed in resolution not a bug,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">what are the priorities of defects&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">how many duplicates are among them,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">feedback from analysts through a questionnaire, where they evaluated the work of each tester according to different criteria,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">similar feedback from development,</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">% missed defects in the production environment for the month / release,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">number of tasks tested&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">average time for defect registration,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">average time for defect validation,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">average time for incident handling from escort,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">% of errors uncorrected in the release,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">regression coefficient and many others.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All data was summarized in tables, which were then analyzed by the project project manager. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If some metrics differed from the targets, then measures were taken. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is how the regular collection of metrics on one of our projects looked like.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/093/df8/108/093df81089fb9cfcf997f145a9b0ae86.png"></div><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Metrics in the context of the project</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
And this is how the collection of metrics on the quality of work of the testing team looked like, and for comparison, dollar and ruble teams of contractors were taken.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3a/5e3/aa7/a3a5e3aa7fceeebaf6b3ea624c9b9e08.png"></div><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Team metrics</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
We collected statistics on the quality of work of the current team, determined the quality criteria and satisfaction with the work of the team by project analysts, developers and the project manager. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now there is an understanding with what indicators the import substitution process began - the very set of metrics with which the result could be compared.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Immersing new people</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then it was possible to prepare materials for immersing new people in the project and gradually transferring competencies and tasks to the new team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To make the process go smoothly and painlessly, a schedule plan was developed. The key feature was that the main testing competencies were concentrated with me, and I was not just a distributor of tasks for testing resources, but a test manager on projects where import substitution was required. That is, an understanding of the testing strategy, test plans, criteria for starting and completing the test, business priorities - all this was within the framework of my knowledge and competencies, and I could only competently build a plan for the phased replacement of people.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was decided to compile a knowledge matrix on the project. To do this, all design subsystems / modules / functions were written out, and everyone in the testing group of the old team had to put a self-rating on a five-point scale, as far as he was immersed in the subsystem / module / function. More details about the knowledge matrix </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in my article “What the testing of the state information system taught us”</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , there you can find the template of the knowledge matrix and use it in your work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then we updated the project wiki and for this we asked the leaders of the testing groups in the old team to supplement or create teaching materials, instructions for immersion in the subsystems / modules / functions, which we identified as the most critical for transferring knowledge. These manuals and instructions were necessary to transfer to the new team in the first place.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The transferred project knowledge base looked something like this:</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebe/1c4/32e/ebe1c432e2d419e9959ab2e71aba2e7a.png"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In parallel with this process, Skype meetings were planned with leading analysts for the subsystem / module, which were attended by both those responsible for testing from the old and the new team.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The purpose of the Skype meetings was to explain the business process of the subsystem / module, to highlight the main business functions from the point of view of the analyst, comments, what to look for when testing, which is important for the customer + parallel discussion of new improvements.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What gave the Skype meetings:&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">teaming: old + new,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Record of a Skype lecture with the participation of leading analysts of all subsystems / modules, which can be used in the future to immerse new people in the project,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Improving communications “analyst-tester”,&nbsp;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">knowledge matrix in a joint team of old and new testers, according to which it was possible to monthly monitor the growth of immersion in the project of new people.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Upon completion of the first stage of introducing new people, the key tasks were completed:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">methodical materials for immersion in the project were collected,</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Familiarization of teams and knowledge sharing,</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">new people were initially “brought” under the more experienced old team members who were tasked with monitoring the quality of work on testing new team members,</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">knowledge matrices of new / old test participants have been compiled, which, as they immerse themselves in the project, are updated on a regular basis monthly.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the second stage, it was necessary to consolidate the acquired knowledge of the process, the project, and interviews were planned, which were also carried out in several iterations.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, the person responsible for the subsystem / module from the old testing team interviewed everyone who was immersed in his subsystem / module for knowledge of the business of the subsystem, assessed the quality of the compiled test designs, regression test cases for new improvements, and statistics on missing defects after the test were collected (always someone more immersed selectively checked new improvements to avoid missing defects from new testers).&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then, the leading analysts evaluated the new testers using a 30-minute interview asking questions about its subsystem. Often, the leading analyst was not required to conduct an interview, if during the work he interacted a lot with the new tester and could evaluate the degree of immersion in the functionality without an interview. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When it became necessary to rotate retiring participants from the old team, we did not coordinate the rotation for their expensive specialists, but carried out such a rotation on our own, expanding the team with new people from Russia.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another important task was not to offend the testers of the old team, but to clarify that we began to work not only with them, but also to expand the team, attracting other specialists, that there are no questions to the competencies of people, there is a production need to expand the geography of the distributed team and we will do it together . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After half a year of such rotation, the team’s volume, of course, has greatly increased, which was planned. But as soon as the performance indicators of the new testers became similar to those of the old ones, and the satisfaction coefficient of analysts and developers of the project stabilized, the opposite process began - the reduction of the team due to the gradual withdrawal of more expensive testers and replacing them with Russian specialists.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In parallel, the production process was analyzed and feedback was removed, the most critical problems that had to be solved with each new release were highlighted. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An example of collecting feedback from analysts on the work of testers:</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/208/2fc/d8f/2082fcd8f0de1542a3ea3153b96e1dc4.png"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An example of a summary list of identified problems of the testing process, a strategy for solving problems and monitoring the correction of the situation, in order not to impair the quality of testing on a project where the process of import substitution of resources was carried out:</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c3/a97/2f3/8c3a972f3be9077b5dfb5bdd769459f9.png"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The project management and the director of the department were regularly sent reports with information on the results of import substitution. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The reports included summary information with the results of the analysis of the work of old and new testers, demonstrated progress in the transfer of knowledge and analysis of the quality of the teams according to predefined quality assessment criteria. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The import substitution process lasted for about a year, as the teams were very large at the start of the process, and the projects were significant for the department. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This caused certain difficulties in the substitution process, and could lead to a sharp loss in quality if import substitution is carried out quickly.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Economical effect</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the end, you can calculate how much budget savings have occurred after the process of import substitution.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the start of import substitution, the number of dollar testers was approximately 60 people. In the process of import substitution, the team increased approximately 1.5 times at the peak and then returned to the number of 50 people. The size of the team even decreased slightly due to the optimization of testing and increasing competence, which eventually became completely on the side of LANIT.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The economic benefit from the work done was 35%, but the real advantages are that the task of import substitution spurred us to open our own resource centers for the needs of the department.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Initially, the centers of competence were conceived to solve problems with the lack of testing staff due to the active development of testing in the department, but over time, specialists from different directions appeared there - support, DevOps specialists, development, analytics. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the moment, our department has almost completely switched to working with Russian testers. It is important to note that the majority are department employees working in regional resource centers. We have opened their own resource centers for testing in Chelyabinsk, Izhevsk, Perm and used </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> most of the work on many projects completely close their test teams. By the way, we have a vacancy in the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">development of automated tests</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now the development vector of the testing direction in the department is focused on expanding its centers of competence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Attracting outsourcing teams goes by the wayside. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We use them to quickly scale as the needs of the project grow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the principles of working with large distributed teams in our department remain unchanged, in detail about the testing process with the participation of large teams for GIS projects, is described in </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">my article. </font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&nbsp;The accumulated experience allows us to quickly introduce large teams into the project, train, build competencies, quickly gain momentum in the speed of testing when rotating teams and / or employees within the department without losing the quality of the product.</font></font></div>
