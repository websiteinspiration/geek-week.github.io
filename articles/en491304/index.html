Finland is Nokia, saunas, hockey, skiing, heavy metal, Angry Birds. And the happiest people on the planet for 2018 on WHR (these are, rather, economic indicators than the desire to joyfully watch the carpet all the time). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A brief history: at first there was just land with local peoples, then the territory became part of Sweden for a long time, in 1809 it became part of the Russian Empire (but gained a strong independence, even its own brand went), and immediately after the Bolsheviks came to power, it became a separate country with permission of Lenin. That is, the inhabitants of the once part of the Empire missed the whole plot from the nineties and from the USSR. More precisely, they saw part of it in the crosshairs of a sniper scope during the wars of 39-44.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have Friday urbanism again, and I want to talk about the city of Helsinki. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main sensation of the city is a surge of oxytocin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a hormone that, among other things, is responsible for the long-term love of a man for a woman, a parent for a child and a man for a dog. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is expressed in the physical sensation of happiness in the form of calm and security. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Helsinki has enough of both. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To begin with, it is the safest city in the world in the event of a nuclear war. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because about 60 years ago, here they began to dig tunnels with excitement and dug up almost a second underground city in the rock.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rocky City</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Helsinki stands on a rather complex rock formation. It was difficult in the sense that building a big city here somehow did not occur to anyone until a wide assortment of Russians appeared. The Russian Empire really wanted to reduce Swedish influence, and therefore moved the capital to, in fact, a fishing village. And closer to St. Petersburg, and away from the existing pro-Swedish capital. As a result, the city is very young, and was planned immediately and very correctly. That is, from scratch there was a master plan for the development of Yu.A. Erenström and, to a large extent, K.L. Engel. I must say that the master plan for the city from the very very zero, in fact, is quite a rare occurrence. This sometimes happens after a large bombing (Rotterdam), earthquakes or large-scale renovation, or during a quick arrangement of the capital: for example,it was so from the most beautiful engineering point of view of Yerevan. But I’ll better tell about his thoughtfulness separately.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/r8/ha/1or8hamep2sszuqre4w9duchyi8.jpeg"><br>
<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ehrenström is a Swede, so he used the Swedish quarter system. In the center, they were marked by animals so that even the illiterate could orient themselves. A unicorn, by the way, then seemed more realistic than a platypus.</font></font></sup><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Under Helsinki incredibly dofiga granite. The usual picture is plus or minus 30 centimeters of soil, and then the plate begins. To make you understand the depth of the problem, I note that trees are planted with explosions. They laid the engineering charge, then bang, bang, it turns out a hole under the tree. You can fill the soil and grow. The first city park with 900 trees was planted in circumstances when all the free explosives were needed for another, so they used drilling and pouring water in the summer, and then waited until the winter to pull out the ice several times.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the 60s, the development of the underground part of the city began. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the one hand, there was a policy of urban architecture limiting the height of buildings (that is how the first underground floors appeared under the main historical shopping center - Stockmann). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The military was digging bunkers and bomb shelters, plus communications were needed between all this - and somehow it turned out that by the time of the panic over the nuclear war, there was a rather extensive network of tunnels under the city. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naturally, they began to use it. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order for you to understand what “quite branched” is, just evaluate the composition of one of the areas:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Above ground: Kamppi's huge mall</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Ground level and below: city bus station with 900 bus departures per day in the city</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 6 meters deep: international bus station with 700 departures per day (very busy by European standards)</font></font></li>
<li> 30   —  </li>
<li>   —   . </li>
</ol><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zg/xq/wm/zgxqwmjs1imnzm3qj99ftknncwu.jpeg"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But more often the layers are a little smaller. This is usually about a pedestrian tunnel and metro station, or about an underground store and parking under it, or something else. Then water and energy. Underground there is an underground power station, a thermal station, a reservoir, a swimming pool, an ice rink, a sports complex with handball and soccer fields (futsal, true), a family amusement park, cafes, museum halls, a book depository, a lot of parking lots and other objects. Almost each of them has a dual purpose: there are food supplies, water, PPE, generators and everything else in case of a threat. The reservoir, by the way, is used quite originally, like a temperature accumulator - the water from it is driven into the urban climate system, and then it is again exchanged heat with the surrounding granite. Some of the tunnels are used as highways for trucks: for example,A lot of supplies for shops in the center are made through the system of tracks under the city, so there are almost no trucks in the center.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Finns continue to dig enthusiastically. And they do it in accordance with the general plan: as for the city at the top there is a development plan, so for the dungeons there is a plan for long-term development. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With underground objects they caught a couple of interesting bugs, almost impossible in other cities. For example, the network of car tunnels and parking lots under the city center is very developed, and there you can drive several blocks underground just like that, for example, under the shopping district: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/tz/7c/dstz7c8_sfusyl7phasvi9ijyzo.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first 15 minutes of parking were free for drivers. The taxi drivers understood this and began to go around traffic jams. From the point of view of the system, everything is fine: drove in, stayed in the parking lot for less than 15 minutes, drove out. When the traffic became higher, they began to sort it out and corrected it - now the parking is immediately paid, and they make a pass for pass-through.</font></font><br>

Since Finland is not the largest country in the world, almost no dubbing is done here, and films are in the original language (most often English) with subtitles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, English is learned here not so much from schoolwork as from the environment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And there are quite a lot of foreigners, especially in Helsinki. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In IT, for example, you can work without knowledge of Finnish. </font></font><br>

In the city there are saunas almost everywhere. Private houses simply have one such, multi-unit old are being built with a common for all, new - with separate for each family inside the apartments. Sauna can be found in the hotel, in Burger King, even on the Ferris wheel there is one cabin with a sauna (rented for an hour). Naturally, at the airport in the business lounge and at </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the flight personnel training center,</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> too.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Corporate parties usually take place also in the sauna. The combination of Finnish love to swell and the bath is normal: inside they drink low alcohol, but then they come off. By the way, about a swell - this is a state monopoly that provides very expensive alcohol from Monday to Saturday, on Sunday it just doesn’t sell anything stronger than 5 degrees in stores (but in restaurants). Therefore, the ferry to Tallinn is very popular not at all because of the charms of the city's architecture. By the way, the story of 54321 is one of the best in terms of memoriality. They say that adult thirst here began after the introduction of Prohibition, and on April 5, 32nd at 10:00 it was canceled. Before that, “very strong tea” was served here in a cafe in the center, pregnant grandmothers with canisters under the dress walked around the city,and at a jazz concert in one of the hotels they distributed cognac instead of tea after certain compositions. Alcohol was hidden between the barrels of resin, carried behind the ships on a leash (to unhook during the test) and generally did everything to sabotage the dry law.</font></font><br>

This damn smart solution to prevent forest fires. It is clear that the people will still fry their barbecue or boil the ear. It is clear that if you do not make the site, this will happen uncontrollably. And here there is a place where everything is safe, and so that everyone abides by the rules - it is provided with a toilet, firewood, benches, a canopy-gazebo and other things. So cheaper than stew.</font></font><br>
