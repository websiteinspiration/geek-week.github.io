<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About MyQRcards Electronic Business Card Project</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Back in 2014, I worked as an IT director in the management company of a fairly large Russian holding. We have made for the top management web pages with electronic business cards. Sticked stickers with QR on the phone covers of employees, QR led to these pages.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uf/b5/t1/ufb5t1sex7blwn3z_apb-o5sb2g.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We began to show off in front of partners and customers at meetings and hand them out instead of a return business card, not a piece of paper, which most put in a trouser pocket and then erase or forget on the bedside table ... And a nameplate with a QR code on the smartphone‚Äôs cover. Reading the code, our new acquaintance gets to a web page with an electronic business card, where your photo, contacts and company information are displayed - down to the office coordinates and academic degree (well, say, if you are a professor, or like I MSMK;). In addition, a list of social networks is available, where you can add friends in one click. And, of course, you can save a business card with photos and all information to your contacts, or write to the owner of a business card in WhatApp in one click.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main value of all this action was not so much to surprise the client with a fashionable electronic business card, thereby showing their digital superiority, but that the client (that is, a new friend) added a business card to your phone with you, which means when you called - Your photo and all the information was highlighted, as if from an old friend. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You will not wait long for an answer or explain who you are. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(By the way, I practically stopped taking the phone from unfamiliar numbers. I defeated spam!) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, having made such a handmade solution ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù for ourselves, we continued to deal with other interesting tasks.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The work has begun!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2019, at a conference, my colleagues and I were again left without paper business cards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People began to pay attention that we are sharing a fashionable electronic business card from a smartphone case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were requests to make them the same pages with their electronic business cards ... Well, as an entrepreneur, I certainly had euphoria - this is the same topic! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Urgently need to start the project! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Googled, found several abandoned projects of similar subjects on the Internet, it didn‚Äôt bother ... </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">FUCKUP No. 1:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> if when researching an idea and testing the hypotheses ‚Äúwho is your client‚Äù or ‚Äúis there a market‚Äù you see abandoned projects - this is a sign! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Look around, analyze the reasons, look for answers ... There should be a lively demand for any product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If there is no demand, and you are dreaming of a blue ocean - a call!</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to check the demand and market readiness for your idea?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I found several ways for myself. I share: </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
1. The first method for assessing the ‚Äúsuitability‚Äù of an idea is ‚ÄúPark‚Äù (from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg). Walking in the morning in the Silicon Valley park, he sat down on a bench with unfamiliar passers-by and started a story about his idea. Having told the idea, he asked how much interest it had. The answer was usually: "yes, great thought ...". If so, Mark asked if the stranger was ready to buy this product for a certain price (he voiced the estimated price). And asked to evaluate the chance of purchase on a 10-point scale. If in response I received a willingness below 8 out of 10, then most likely I won‚Äôt buy it. And only if the confidence was close to absolute (9 or 10 points) - Mark recorded that the idea is suitable and you can think further!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
2. Next - an assessment of demand on the Internet: ask yourself how your customer will look for your product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lock the top3 keywords. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Go to </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wordtart</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and look for these keywords, are users often looking for them? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then compare the results (the number of searches) with</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the density of competition (how many resources and landings on the Internet are already targeted to this target audience (appear in the search results)</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">potential market size: for example, if at your request ‚Äúwireless vacuum cleaner‚Äù you see 150 thousand requests per month, and the word ‚Äúelectronic business card‚Äù is 1 thousand, then you will receive demand 150 times lower in reality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, think about how you can compare a new project (from the demand for what you know how to buy) to appreciate the real interest.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
3. The third method of assessment: ‚Äúthe blue ocean - is it a friend or an enemy‚Äù? Everyone says - look for the blue ocean! However, many forget that the blue ocean strategy is the creation of pre-existing demand in a new market. That is, you must not only create a product, but also create demand. But the latter is often forgotten. They simply believe that there is demand. So this method of valuation is to evaluate ‚Äúbut will you have the strength and resources to create demand and rock the market‚Äù? Moreover, you will do this not only for yourself, but also for all competitors who usually do not doze off and just stick to the emerging demand like leeches. So evaluate the available investments and financial resources of potential competitors. If the assessment is not in your favor - do not look for the blue ocean! This is a failure.You have to play with existing demand and by making a competitive product pick up part of the existing market. It is many times cheaper! How to estimate the project budget? The template for the IT development project will come next.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">FUCKUP No. 2</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : ‚ÄúThere is definitely a demand, because we and others like the idea so much!‚Äù No matter how. We return to the previous section ‚Äúhow to check demand and market readiness for your idea‚Äù. If you get right to the point, it will be like with our electronic business cards to the coronavirus. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A small insight, what is the relationship between electronic business cards and coronavirus? As it turned out, a year after the project was in stagnation - there is a connection! Growth has gone.</font></font></b></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It turned out that people began to meet less often the appearance of coronavirus. Also, everyone suddenly remembered about hygiene. They became afraid to pick up other people's things. In particular, business cards!</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
With the outbreak of the epidemic, companies began to contact us and acquire a solution of electronic business cards for their employees. To make it clearer, I‚Äôll explain how the MyQRcards electronic business card works.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
1. The company acquires a subscription to electronic business cards for its employees (but you can download the application for free and use electronic business cards for your loved one: to create a business card, put the mobile application in 5 clients and try everything yourself). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
2. Through the personal account, the administrator responsible for creating and issuing electronic business cards to employees, enters a list of employees with basic data. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gl/yw/hg/glywhgynfmfls61-cbg_7r9czaw.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
for private users: just download the application from the store and create a business card from it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
3. From the application, you can order a metal nameplate sticker, pasting which on the phone case you can conveniently share a business card. Of course, no one bothers without a sticker to share a business card, sending it from the application to a new friend, or showing a QR Business card, which is easy to scan by pointing the smartphone camera at it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You can read more, because the post is not about the solution, but about the experience of building an IT business, which is based on a mobile application. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">FUCKUP No. 3</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: The blue ocean is your friend ?! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Aw, let's create a cool thing! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No matter how. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will continue the topic of the lack of demand in the new market: there may not be demand not only because no one has come up with this cool thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The idea itself costs nothing without implementation and demand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And what do you think, what percentage of success gives a great idea and how much does the success of an enterprise depend on demand and a quality product? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Write your opinion in the comments, as I myself argue periodically on this issue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am sure of one thing: if at least one of these factors is not enough weight, the project will fail. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As, in fact, what happened with the MyQRcardS project before the coronavirus. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But there were several factors actively preventing the spread of such a cool idea:</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reasons for the failure of the MyQRcardS project of electronic business cards (before the arrival of the coronavirus </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
1. Habits: as it turned out later, when the electronic business card application was already developed and launched, users don‚Äôt like something new, which they used to do without, and when this new one does not simplify their life. We are all idlers by nature! And when you need to install the application, create a business card and start using it - it's easier to do nothing and look for a mossy card holder in the nightstand. Rebuild units. But they become your followers and customers. Appreciate them! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
2. Mentality: for example, in Japan, the exchange of business cards is a ritual. In such a country, the launch of electronic business cards is a fiasco! A business card is a cult. Her transfer is action and respect for the interlocutor. Take a look at famous business cards</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/2r/qg/xk2rqg1ajtxt8apxhyztlis_xk8.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But what about the Russians? As I understand it, most Russians are just quite comfortable coming to a meeting without a business card, and when you need to exchange contacts - just dictate the phone: long, not elegant, not effective - but we don‚Äôt care !? =) Of course, not everyone has that, but if the project needs mass for payback, and the mentality is inappropriate, then there will be no success. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
3. Prosperity level: where is it here, MyQRcardS is free to create one business card, and most do not need more? ... Yes, but it takes up space on a smartphone, and we are accustomed to saving due to limited abundance. There is always not enough space on smartphones and putting an extra application, for many, a stop factor.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What has changed with the advent of the pandemic? We quietly become different and this is visible. People began to wash their hands, a healthy disgust appeared, which has long been characteristic of a number of nations. The companies began to think about how to protect employees from a pandemic (and they first began to think, since they bear the whole burden of responsibility for workers). And many are beginning to understand that exchanging business cards, in view of the current situation, is not such a safe thing and began to look for electronic substitutes for the ancient ritual. In general, the corporate user began to search and find us, without this, the project was doomed! </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here are brief financial statistics on the project</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : how much does it cost to create a mobile application for apple and android, plus a backend, web and infrastructure for them? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Expenses</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/dg/_t/tedg_tvffeqwn6m42drjn_xq54c.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Total, to launch the solution - 2.7 mln.r. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(rounding) and further on at 2.4 million per year for support. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not forget that the application itself does not live. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Users find bugs, new versions of phone operating systems come out that require updating your applications, and new devices (especially for the iPhone, this is important), new requirements appear on the app stores of the mobile platforms Apple store and Google play market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, support and continuous improvement are needed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The composition of the team of a similar IT project (creating a mobile application of electronic business cards MyQRcardS) by roles, by the example of our project (some of the resources were used from the existing company team and were not calculated into the project budget) but if it were completely done on our own:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Analyst and / or product owner</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Architect / Development Manager</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IOS Developer</font></font></li>
<li> Android (     )</li>
<li>WEB-</li>
<li>Back-end </li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul><br>
<h3>     MyQRcards</h3><br>
<ol>
<li>   ‚Äî     ( ‚Äî )    30      .  ‚Äî   Google  Apple.       50%.   ‚Äî  5000.         1000$.</li>

</ol><br>
<h3>-  - </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To summarize what needs to be done to create an IT project, I would say the following: </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
1. Check the idea, be sure to interview as many strangers as possible (acquaintances often do not want to offend or argue with you, so their answers are not always enough objective) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
2. Calculate the project economy, taking into account the following cost items:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Registration of a company or individual entrepreneur (up to 30 thousand rubles) initially and from 40t.r. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taxation is a simplification of income (6% of turnover for IT is optimal). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not take self-employed into account, since they cannot have employees.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Office rent - from 500 rubles per sq.m. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on average per month. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything is online - you can probably, but I can‚Äôt do it ... Productivity is falling.</font></font></li>
<li>:     (      ),        1.5.     (, , ,     .)  . -    -   .      ~14%. </li>
<li>,    ‚Äî     20%    .     ,     ,     70-100% .       : -         (., google.adwords,       )</li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
3. Calculate the monetization of the project based on the fact that marketplaces applications in a circle take up to 50% of revenue. Calculate how much you need to sell in pieces so that the project pays off. Think about who you need to support and provide these volumes and adjust your spending budget. It will not be difficult to calculate if you try to simulate the sales process, calculate the time spent on one sale, multiply the time costs by the payroll of participants and the coefficient 1.3-1.4 (more than 70% of the employees do not work on the total working time). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
4. Lay down other overhead costs: creating a site with support, design of marketing materials, software licenses, office equipment, hospitality expenses. Offhand - about 5% of the project budget excluding marketing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
5. Try to find the backbone of the team and discuss all issues with them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
6. Plan your investment for a minimum of one year. A rare IT product cycle can be less than a year. The minimum development period to MVP is one year. Complex projects - from two to three years. Then another year - entry into the market and only then - development and growth. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As for our project of electronic business cards MyQRcardS - the total cost of the project, currently amounted to about $ 68,000 (5 million rubles), including operating costs.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Payback? She is not without corporate sales in our project. And if your path is subscriptions in Apple and Google markets - consider the economy with the costs higher, since even without the marketing component, which in such projects reaches 70% of the total costs (promotion of applications), payback is a very difficult task if You, of course, are not a developer, a tester, a designer, a marketer, a support specialist, an architect, a seller, or an entrepreneur in one package, but you did something very necessary, with high demand, the audience‚Äôs willingness to pay for subscriptions, and something super- viral! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But despite the fact that the payback of our project is illusory, we do not plan to close the project of electronic business cards.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We are an IT company and the costs of supporting this solution are not so significant for us, but we and our customers like the solution. And today, for us it turned out to be the most important and relevant that the application of electronic business cards MyQRcardS helps to avoid the physical exchange of business cards, which is fraught with the spread of viral infection due to the current situation of the epidemic - coronavirus. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
