Honestly, I don‚Äôt have time for a post for Habr - I plow three times on a remote site so that the company I work for survives. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, what was happening around me plunged me into a stupor unusual for my body - no, not from a strange non-working week with an unclear horizon of continuation, but from the attitude of others around the situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I read comments on Habr√© and on social networks, talked with friends, acquaintances and former colleagues from the Very Big Company and was horrified: they are extremely happy about unplanned vacations and ... write complaints about their leaders who asked to work remotely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guys, now is not the time to ramshit! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's take the arguments.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/025/9d4/e3a/0259d4e3a42a9cec18c2ef280e581001.png"></div> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can say that we found, washed, cleaned it from the trash in the garbage dump, and he draws figvam to us ...</font></font></i><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What happens - as simple as possible</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the world of the coronavirus pandemic. This is such a process when a lot of people drop out of their usual working conditions, switch to a remote place, on forced vacations, lose their jobs, etc. Everything is complicated by psychological moments: people are afraid to get sick, infect loved ones, die, but just update the tapes endlessly and get nervous due to a general panic situation. In such conditions, the head works worse, the mood drops, the desire to consume something more expensive than the usual food disappears - largely due to savings, largely because of the anxiety state.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A non-working week added to the confusion and quarreled everyone: employers ask (cannot demand!) Employees to work remotely, some employees bravely increase their labor efforts, partly they shake the decree and the Labor Code, wanting to leave their favorite game or sharpen the barbecue. The biggest difficulty for the business (including IT) is that even if the company itself is working, it is not a fact that its customers are working and ready to buy, which means that the company simply does not have a source of income. As a result, it may seem that those who work are wasted, but this is not so. Any action now is work for the future, which will come anyway, and by the standards of the economy pretty soon. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, all this somewhat apocalyptic picture is crowned by the dollar, which does not inspire anything good.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And you know, psychologically you can understand those who are ready to plow and save the world, and those who want to go inside and honestly cut off a non-working week as a non-working one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But from the point of view of adequacy, it is impossible to understand such guys.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Arguments of ‚Äúnon-working‚Äù and counterarguments to them</font></font></h2> <blockquote><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yeah, the boss didn‚Äôt pay me, he didn‚Äôt give sick leaves, he acted like cattle, and now I have to work for him, no.</font></font></h4></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question number one: ‚ÄúAnd if so, why did you work for him ?! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Afraid that you could not find another place for yourself, or so sincerely loved the project? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Have you been tortured? ‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you always worked quietly in a company where all known labor law norms are violated, why did you stay there and wait for the virus to force you to leave work, slamming the door loudly and carrying revenge? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not shrug, I know the reasons.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fear of moving to a new job and losing the established order of things.</font></font></li>
<li>        ,     ,   ..</li>
<li>   ,   : ,              SEO  -,     .</li>
<li> :    ,  ,     ..</li>
<li>  ,               ,    / /      .   .</li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is, there is always some hidden, crafty gain. And most likely, the leader, being not a stupid person, compared his knowledge of your schools and his benefits, and held you. And yes, guys, it‚Äôs practically impossible for the leadership in small and medium-sized businesses not to know about your tricks. If it seems to you that you are brave, dexterous, skillful, then in fact the boss just closes his eyes and clearly knows why he is holding you.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, if you have been using ‚Äúall amenities‚Äù all this time, now it‚Äôs time to tolerate - so that your crisis does not disappear after your crisis. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, in the coming months, a sufficient number of professionals will become free, so that the competition in the market will be fierce and you, having served your years in a ‚Äúgo-go office‚Äù with not particularly cool experience, will not be able to compete with those who decide / will be forced to change jobs after profile strong companies (not necessarily large).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<blockquote><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These nouveau riche are rowing for themselves, and now they remembered us, over there!</font></font></h4></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The labor market is simple: you come for an interview, talk about yourself, the employer talks about yourself and offers you a price, if everything is ok, you go to work and get your salary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you, as a rule, know for sure whether your work is worth the money, how much you are overestimated or underestimated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After some time after employment, if there is a significant result, you can talk with the manager about increasing the salary or bonus part. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, you can rationally, in accordance with your work, take part of the money from the sale of a jointly created product or service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, the head takes his part.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you now have aroused indignation, I again have two questions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you thought the payment was unfair, why did you sit at work and why were you silent?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you approached and refused, why did you stay?</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, you will be surprised, but in micro and small business with nouveau riche it is pretty bad - it happens that the head receives not much more employees, but is already physically unable to return to hiring. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, try to organize your own business and you will see everything live. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I promise: there will be much surprising, but not enough money.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have a pillow in our company, even if they pay from it!</font></font></h4></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I love this point - despite the fact that everyone is talking about this pillow (variations - a small pillow, gasket, tub, insurance), but no one has seen it and can not accurately name the source of its formation. Yes, of course, if the company is more or less normal, it has some financial reserve, which may be enough for the employees' salaries during quarantine. But along with the depletion of the stock, new problems and losses will come, because often this money is used for business development (in the IT sphere, this can be the purchase of equipment, development tools, etc.). In the face of declining returns, the loss of a pillow could kill a company. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, the money that you get paid in a crisis without cutting you, you need to continue to work out, and not sit idle for weeks - because after the crisis the company may collapse.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, for those who like to add up the salaries of employees and calculate how much money the office needs to maintain staff: do not forget to consider social contributions, include personal income tax and keep in mind that employees are not the only cost item for a company even in super crisis times.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<blockquote><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I already have a small salary that I have to work as a laborer!</font></font></h4></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And what did you work for her? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can return to the first argument.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asked to work? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Does he know the laws ?!</font></font></h4></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alas, the President‚Äôs appeal was in many ways cool and gentle, but the legal field turned out to be different: that‚Äôs why it was necessary to issue several decrees to mayors and governors, and then the Kremlin to explain that who worked remotely should work, and schoolchildren and students should study . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indeed, the measure was rather aimed at those who, for some reason, cannot work from home, for example, state bodies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">authorities, municipalities, some enterprises, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So it‚Äôs difficult to wave the law in this situation, rather, you and the employer must agree really humanly.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the worst case scenario, we will still receive a new instruction with clearer details, in the best case, we will soon return to the office and look into each other's eyes.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<blockquote><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want to rest, I'm tired. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is my opportunity.</font></font></h4></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nobody will bother you, you have the right. If today each of us rests, then in a couple of months, when the situation becomes a little better, we can begin to relax for a long time and with high quality - only without money. Just because there will be no companies - we ourselves have turned our back on them in difficult times.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, employee behavior is now an important marker of corporate loyalty. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, alas, in our blood, the tendency to sway rights and denounce is flowing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, employers are different (employees too). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But today we are not just in the same boat inside the companies, we are all on the same ark. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it depends on each of us, we will sail out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ask yourself why you worked at the company until this day and answer it as honestly as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For some reason, it seems to me that you will want to work remotely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if not, urgently look for a new job, now the window of opportunity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You cannot be in the place you hate.</font></font></div>
