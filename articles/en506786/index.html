<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This reason is an absolutely wrong, destructive approach to conducting technical interviews. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is like an infectious disease that interviewers have and infect those they interview. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some of those whom they interview, then also become interviewers themselves and infect those whom they interview. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Etc.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The problem is that the IT industry assumes that any experienced developer can interview other developers. Where does this conviction come from? The same conclusion, not based on anything. Did he learn this? Did he specifically read about this? Was he getting ready? Not in all cases, of course, but more often than we would like, the answer to all three questions is no. Because it already rolls. They tell you - we are looking for an employee for a new vacancy, tomorrow you will have an interview. And besides this interview you have so many tasks that you have enough for the rest of the day. As a result, all that remains for you is to interview as you once had an interview, without thinking about how effective it is.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What kind of interviews are these? They are not exactly the same, but one of their features is theoretical questions, the answers to which the candidate, in their opinion, must memorize. Such interviews are disgusting in that they give a huge amount of errors of the first and second kind. In fact, there are so many that you can use a random number generator instead of interviews, and the results will be approximately the same.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the one hand, there are candidates who have been specially preparing for these interviews for a long time - they remembered the answers to these questions. No, of course, this does not help them in their work, but interviews with such companies are much easier for them. They may not represent anything in the work, but the interviewer does not care what code the developer writes. Practice is not important for them. I memorized the answers by heart - well done. No goodbye. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the other hand, those who didn‚Äôt specially prepare, but instead spent their time training and practice, such interviews are not able to pass at all. No, of course, they can answer some questions. This may even be quite a few questions, but usually not all.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, the easiest way to get a job is for jumpers. People who change their jobs every few months during their careers are best suited to finding a job and including such interviews. This is surprising: companies do not want to hire people who are likely to leave in a few months, but they are building their hiring process so that these candidates have a very good chance of getting an offer. Most difficult, respectively, on the contrary to those who usually work in the same company for several years. They may have very good abilities in work, but in the search for work - no. On average, they cannot pass such interviews without special training.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Different developers - different experiences, different priorities, different approaches to learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can‚Äôt expect everyone to study at the university, read at least 10 books on programming, memorize everything that is in the standard library and is often used and will now retell it all to you, like a child reading a poem from a stool. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are people who just write code for many years, and do it the way few who can still learn the answers to their stupid questions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But only they will never know about it, because this candidate, in the words of Robert Sweeney, in their opinion, is "not enough senior."</font></font><br>

                        <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>I turned down Daniel Buchmueller for a job at Netflix. After a 60 minute interview I was on the fence, so I concluded that he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt senior enough.‚Äù He went to Amazon instead where he co-founded Amazon Prime Air (their drone delivery service) and was #2 on Fast Company‚Äôs ‚ÄúMost Creative People‚Äù list.<br>
<br>
At some point, we programmers are going to have to admit that we really can‚Äôt judge another programmers technical abilities in a 60 min interview. We end up hiring programmers that are good at interviewing, but not necessarily good at doing the job. And we miss out on engineers like Daniel.<br>

                    </div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, yes, this is what happens. The developer has 10 years of commercial experience in software development, he has fluent English, he worked in many companies on different projects, was a leading developer, but as a result of such an interview it turns out that he is a middle. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Comes to funny. There are sheep interviewers who at some point begin to enjoy the fact that they ‚Äúfill up‚Äù the candidate. There already questions can be specially selected so that the candidate could not answer many of them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Companies in 2020 are, on average, stunningly naive. It seems to them that it is enough to find out whether the candidate has learned the answers to their 20 questions to determine whether he is suitable. Accordingly, even a very good candidate who could do this job cool might perhaps answer only a few questions. Maybe this could bring at least some benefit in evaluating the candidate, but then in many cases the questions would have to be selected specifically for him. Because, if the questions are common to all, why would they suddenly give some kind of objective idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe candidate? Usually the interviewer simply asks about what he knows well. But the experience of the interviewer cannot and should not coincide with the experience of all candidates. They did other tasks, used different approaches in development, read articles by other authors, talked with other people,went to other events. If a candidate asks the same interviewer his 20 questions, he will answer just a few of them in the same way. Then, it turns out, he is also "not enough senior"? Absurd.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's be more rational. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you need a person to do the job, check how he does the job. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also check how he learns and how easy it is for him to start using the technology that he learned about an hour ago. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No need to check whether he memorized answers to questions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each of these answers may be needed once every 2 years and is google in 3 minutes.</font></font><br>
