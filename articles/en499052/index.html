<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Due to the high cost of flash memory in the second half of the 90s, a rather strange equilibrium was established in the digital photography market: while professionals enjoyed all the advantages of the ultra-modern CompactFlash cards at that time, amateurs in the old fashion were content with ordinary 3.5-inch floppy disks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And so it continued until IBM intervened.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That which cannot be</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1999, the American corporation released unique hard drives under the Microdrive trademark, the dimensions of which were ... 42 by 36 mm! That's right: the kids had the same dimensions as memory cards, except for the thickness: 5 mm versus 3.3. The updated form factor is called CompactFlash Type II. Since Microdrive had an interface identical to that of conventional CompactFlash, compatible memory card readers supported work not only with miniature HDDs, but also with ordinary memory cards. At the start, two models were available to users: 170 and 340 megabytes, but already in 2000, IBM released micro-winchesters at 500 MB and 1 GB.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/a6/hc/aaa6hcvkw2kjp0z3yn95xatbr7i.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IBM Microdrive - a hard drive the size of a memory card</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Inside the IBM Microdrive there was a tiny one-inch hard drive, the spindle of which rotated at a speed of 3600 revolutions per minute, and the data transfer rate varied from 2.6 to 4.2 MB / s with an average delay of 8.3 ms . At the same time, all microdrive models manufactured by the American corporation had a buffer size of 128 kilobytes.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-f/hd/ek/-fhdektywy80jh0ipa0infl-u44.png"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One-inch hard drive installed in IBM Microdrive, in comparison with a coin with a face value of 50 eurocents.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
At the time of release, Microdrive had two advantages that were extremely important for the end user: high capacity and noticeably lower cost of a megabyte of data, which ensured their demand. However, already in 2006-2007, inch HDDs were almost completely replaced by memory cards from the market: flash chips began to rapidly become cheaper, and miniature hard drives simply could not compete with them on equal terms. There are many different reasons for this, among which the following should be highlighted:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>   .             1,2 ,    CompactFlash  .  , Microdrive     :            ( 3  ).</li>
<li>  .        4‚Äì6 /      ,    CompactFlash  45 /.</li>
<li>  .          ,    ,  ,     .</li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And Microdrive just got stuck in slots. The original CompactFlash had a special recess on the side, for which the memory card could be conveniently picked up with a fingernail when removed. However, the brainchild of IBM was not deprived of such a recess: when developing a micro-winchester, we had to use the available space as efficiently as possible and literally every tenth of a millimeter was counted. Problems arose even when working with devices equipped with mechanical extractors: you press a button, the drive is ejected from the connector, slightly rising above the edge of the camera, and ... then you just have to try to shake out the Microdrive, which did not benefit the drive itself or the camera.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Portable gadget manufacturers have solved this problem simply. For example, a couple of plastic tags were included with the CASSIOPEIA E-100 handheld computer that could be glued onto the Microdrive for easy removal. Fun fact: this device supported the installation of two such drives at once. Moreover, after installing a pair of micro-winchesters with labels pasted on them, the card reader compartment did not close anymore, as the operating instructions stated directly: the creators of the PDA decided to warn users that this is an absolutely normal situation and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about (the main thing is to hide the plug in a safe place, so as not to get lost).</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nn/ek/lo/nnekloyrlufv2dybmtxg3bfshrc.png"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Modern problems require modern solutions.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In general, despite the cheapness and spaciousness, Microdrive was not the most convenient solution, prompting compromises for both users and manufacturers of hardware. It is not surprising that when prices for flash memory finally fell, they completely abandoned microdrives, and the CompactFlash Type II standard itself soon disappeared into oblivion.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The situation considered is more related to portable gadgets, however, something similar happened in the production of mobile drives oriented to work with personal computers and laptops. Recall that the world's first removable flash drive in consumer class based on flash memory was a device created by the aforementioned M-Systems and called DiskOnKey. A compact plastic case with a ring for a keychain and a built-in USB connector, a hidden protective cap - in the image of this device, the flash drive familiar to us is unmistakably guessed.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ba/j_/ho/baj_hojzytumyiajl2a6-zm45ls.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The world's first DiskOnKey flash drive from the company M-Systems</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
An interesting fact: in America, DiskOnKey was distributed under the IBM brand, which became the official partner of M-Systems. Since the versions of the US flaunted the IBM logo, which once created the first hard drive, many mistakenly attribute the invention of the flash drive to a North American corporation, although this is not true.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/h6/_3/czh6_3mce3luqzkweyzotw1n-ty.png"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IBM's exclusive DiskOnKey for the US market:</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
spot </font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10 differences</font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The first DiskOnKey was released in September 2000 and carried 8 MB of flash memory on board, and the baby‚Äôs retail price was $ 50. Closer to Christmas, M-Systems introduced 16 and 32 MB modifications, the cost of which was 2 and 4 times higher, respectively. Despite its compact size and good read / write speed (about 10 times higher compared to a standard 3.5-inch floppy disk despite the fact that the device did not require additional power and a special drive), DiskOnKey was still a lot of enthusiasts due to the high cost . That is why the portable HDD market continued to grow rapidly, giving rise to a number of very unusual devices worthy of special mention.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, the most logical, simple and at the same time cheap (since there is no need to re-profile production facilities) way to create mobile drives is to put ordinary hard drives in durable cases that allow you to connect them to PCs or laptops via a standard USB port, FireWire or eSATA or all of the above.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f3/lp/qn/f3lpqn0laaqfuekfavxsox64qly.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An external hard drive is like an internal hard drive, only in the case the</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
lion's share of the market was occupied by just such devices. In addition, any person could purchase an external case separately and then install an OEM hard drive or a disk removed from an old PC or laptop on their own. This approach allowed us to further save money and at the same time get at our disposal a mobile data warehouse of the required volume. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Do not forget about such a wonderful invention as a docking station for HDD. Here you can recall the family of devices presented by SSI Computer Corp at the Computex 2008 industry exhibition, which deservedly won prizes at the end of the event.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bp/tb/8r/bptb8rua4mmutjpm7dw6g4bl13c.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">SSI Computer Corp HDD Docking Stations</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The most versatile of the entire line was the SI-7908UI. The miniature stand supported work with hard drives of both 3.5 and 2.5 inches, and also boasted a full set of external interfaces: eSATA, USB 2.0, IEEE-1394a and IEEE-1394b. In addition to her, the company‚Äôs portfolio included: docking stations with an integrated USB hub SI-7908HSUS, a model SI-7908HCSUS equipped with a universal card reader, and a special modification for connoisseurs of the beautiful SI-8808, which is compact, smooth in shape and with LED backlighting .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although the docking stations are an excellent solution for working with an extensive media library or for quick backups (among the variety of such devices there are also two-slot solutions that support the function of cloning disks without a computer), from the point of view of mobile data storage they were not very practical decision. In fact, in addition to the HDD, you will not carry around a massive stand with a power supply or buy a device for each PC or laptop that you use at home and at work?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, the market for mobile drives was not limited to the above devices: large companies made active attempts to create original HDD-drives that would be as compact and convenient as real flash drives, and at the same time boast more capacity and cheapness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such devices were assembled at the factories of MSI, Archos, BTC and many other companies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the most interesting models (which is really shy) can be called the WD Passport Pocket Drive WD60W028 with a capacity of 6 gigabytes.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/yz/ya/zwyzya7isnkgfnhvf-kpayihzj4.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WD Passport Pocket Drive - the best HDD in the world </font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In terms of size, shape and dimensions (61.1 √ó 45.7 √ó 9.5 mm with a weight of only 50 grams), this baby most of all resembled an expensive gift lighter. The Winchester was equipped with a swivel USB plug, consisting of two sections connected by a swivel joint. Thanks to this, the plug could be rotated 90 degrees in a vertical plane (both ways), which made it possible to connect the device to any laptop or PC model without any problems, regardless of the location and orientation of the USB connector. Unlike similar solutions of other vendors, the USB plug fully functioned in absolutely any position, since it connected directly to the controller via flexible wires, while in many other similar devices the plug segments were electrically connected to each other using spring-loaded pads and, as a result ,worked only in default and extreme positions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The one-piece drive case was made of thick, 1.5-mm silver plastic, and for additional protection of the device from shock, a fitted rubber cover was supplied.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/yo/7w/khyo7wub_h7xigdymtw3ftxu_70.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WD Passport Pocket Drive in a complete case</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Inside the device was a miniature WD60WP-32LPV0 hard drive made in the CF + Type II form factor, as well as a thin controller circuit board, the heart of which was the CY7C68300B chip (such microcircuits were used, in particular, in 2.5 Inch External HDD My Passport). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The drive and controller were additionally wrapped with thick elastic tape, which securely fixed the components inside the case, and also served as an additional buffer that absorbs vibration.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/oh/gk/hnohgk6uwcaybexiwivgwtgdopa.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Microdrive WD60WP-32LPV0 format CF + Type II</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The WD60WP-32LPV0 had a rotation speed of 3600 r / s and a 2 MB buffer, while the actual available disk space when formatted in NTFS was 5.7 gigabytes. The time of access to data for such a baby was about 11 ms (track to track access time was only 1 ms), and the performance during sequential reading reached 8 MB / s. An important trump card of this model was low power consumption: about 60 mA in idle, 290 - when reading, 285 - when writing, and about 255 - when searching for the desired track. For comparison, the IBM Travelstar 80GN with a capacity of 40 GB was much more voracious, consuming up to 120 mA in standby mode, 630 mA for reading operations, 520 mA for writing and up to 630 mA for searching. Thus, the WD Passport Pocket Drive as close as possible in terms of cost to flash drives of those years, significantly outperforming competitors. Alas,At that time, the microdrive era was drawing to a close: memory chips were getting cheaper, and HDDs, even the most advanced ones, could not compete with memory cards and flash drives in such parameters as compactness, shock resistance, and ‚Äúgluttony‚Äù. But Winchesters could offer the best price-to-capacity ratio, and in the end, HDD manufacturers focused on producing exactly 2.5-inch portable models, though after a series of experiments (sometimes not entirely successful).and in the end, HDD makers focused on producing just 2.5-inch portable models, though after a series of experiments (sometimes not entirely successful).and in the end, HDD makers focused on producing just 2.5-inch portable models, though after a series of experiments (sometimes not entirely successful).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, for example, in 2003, the title of the most compact external hard drive was awarded to ArchosArcDisk, whose dimensions were only 76 √ó 77 mm: the body of the hard drive was even smaller than a floppy disk.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e6/ql/nk/e6qlnkfpepg-ruvzvfopf6qp9xe.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ArchosArcDisk - the smallest mobile hard drive of 2003. The</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
device was created on the basis of the 1.8-inch Hitachi DK14FA-20 hard drive, had a thickness of only 8.8 mm and weighed 72 grams, that is, slightly more than the MPIO HS100 flash drive with a capacity of 1 , 5 gigabytes (despite the fact that this baby contained as much as 20 GB). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The disk received a microUSB connector and a jack for connecting an external power adapter (supplied) in case the owner encountered a lack of power via a USB port when working with a laptop.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to the technical characteristics, ArchosArcDisk at first glance did not lag behind the 2.5-inch counterparts of those times: the spindle speed reached 4200 r / s, the average access time was 7.14 ms, and the built-in buffer was 2 MB. Nevertheless, this model had performance problems: the read and write speeds were equal and did not exceed 5 MB / s, which was explained by the use of an outdated controller and artificially limited bandwidth (obviously, this way the manufacturer sought to further reduce the cost of the device). Although the mobile drive cost almost twice as much as compared with 2.5-inch brothers of the same size, it still cost significantly less than flash drives (the MPIO HS100 mentioned above at the time of release could be purchased for $ 200),so that in terms of a set of characteristics, the model turned out to be quite successful.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As the confrontation between flash and HDD drives gained momentum, manufacturers of hard drives went to more and more sophisticated tricks, including design ones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just look at this beauty!</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x4/bh/zt/x4bhzt5x-rqym9dephc5ts80d-g.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">LaCie Data Bank - a true jewel!</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The appearance of the LaCie Data Bank mobile drive was created with the participation of the famous FAPorsche studio and one by one repeated the real appearance of a platinum ingot. Even the inscription on the front panel and the logo were stylized as a characteristic print. The design was to the taste of customers and at the same time allowed the manufacturer to increase the dimensions of the device up to 111 √ó 63 √ó 16 mm, thanks to which under the protective cover of older models (several modifications were available on the market based on 1.8-inch Toshiba hard drives with capacities of 20 and 40 GB), in addition to the usual microUSB, a full six-pin IEEE1394 connector appeared. Thus, an external hard drive could be used as a system drive without any problems, which, along with an unusual design, provided the product with an additional competitive advantage.since not every external HDD could boast of native FireWire support.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But do not forget that mobile drives are primarily utilitarian devices. All other things being equal, the user will choose a model that can accommodate as much data as possible, without paying special attention to the design. This simple truth was convincingly proved by the engineers of the Japanese company Buffalo, who presented in 2008 a portable hard drive MiniStation TurboUSB - the world's first mobile HDD with a capacity of 500 GB, based on the 2.5-inch Hitachi Travelstar 5K500.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fo/cl/qc/foclqcc0szfdwvw9jm6ueutw27k.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Buffalo MiniStation TurboUSB - the first portable 500 gigabyte HDD</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This device had, in addition to its record capacity, two other important advantages: a rugged shockproof case and a USB cable with an angled plug, which completely eliminated the possibility of the latter </font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">becoming jammed</font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> during transportation. The rubber bumper located around the perimeter of the device was also equipped with clips for fixing the wire, which made the model even more ergonomic. Although the device turned out to be quite massive and had a nondescript appearance, few paid attention to it even at the start of sales, when they asked for $ 300 for the MiniStation TurboUSB. Which, frankly, is quite a bit when compared with flash drives. Further is better.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In just four years, the first 2 terabyte mobile HDD appeared on the market, with a suggested retail price of just $ 250. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out to be the new flagship of the Western Digital My Passport line.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fb/ea/ub/fbeaub8b6ll82fdwwbqwq72wlcu.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WD My Passport is the first 2 TB portable drive</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thus, if in 2008 1 gigabyte cost about 60 cents, then already in 2012 its price dropped 5 times (to 12 cents): such a rapid reduction in price made mobile HDDs a much more profitable purchase compared to solid state drives for many years, and they developed much faster. So, already in 2013, Toshiba introduced a 2.5-inch MQ03ABB300 drive with a capacity of 3 TB. The record volume was achieved by installing four magnetic plates, each of which had a capacity of 750 GB, but as a result, the drive thickness increased to 15 mm, which made the HDD unsuitable for use in laptops. Subsequently, they were replaced by 5-terabyte models, the thickness of which reached 19 mm at all - such devices could only be installed in individual external enclosures.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wy/u0/cr/wyu0crztq2hypxfuvoesjck2nr0.jpeg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fat Toshiba MQ03ABB300 is the most capacious 2.5-inch drive of 2013.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Recall that the standard slot for the hard drive allows the use of drives with a thickness of 9.5 mm, ultrabooks use 5 or 7 mm models, while high-performance laptops designed to replace a working PC , disks with a maximum thickness of 12.5 mm were installed. But although the production of ‚Äúfat men‚Äù required a change in the technological process, and the HDDs themselves turned out to be less universal, their prime cost was still lower in comparison with the prime cost of solid-state drives, due to which mobile storages based on classic hard drives are still a highly demanded solution. Although without trying to "play on a foreign field" it still could not do.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How can I speed up the performance of the HDD without sacrificing its reliability and, most importantly, the key competitive advantage - the price? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, add a capacious cache based on NAND-memory, where the data that the user accesses most often will be stored. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is this approach that is used to create SSHD, hybrid drives: it turns out "cheap and cheerful." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But Buffalo engineers decided to go a step further by launching in July 2014 the HD-PGDU3 series mobile HDDs equipped with ... built-in RAM.</font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Buffalo HD-PGDU3 - a mobile hard drive that dreams of becoming a real PC</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Japanese manufacturer offered customers two models to choose from: HD-PGD500U3 with a capacity of 500 GB and HD-PGD1.0U3 with a capacity of 1 TB. Both modifications carried on board 1 gigabyte of DDR3 RAM used as a buffer, which in combination with the USB 3.0 interface made it possible to achieve a maximum data transfer rate of up to 400 MB / s! Since DRAM is a volatile memory, Buffalo HD-PGDU3 received a built-in lithium-ion battery that automatically recharged each time the device was connected to a PC or laptop. Its presence excluded the possibility of data loss during an unexpected power outage, and in addition, it allowed to save information in the buffer for several hours after disconnecting from the computer, providing almost instant access to cached files. Of coursethe device came out more massive (81 √ó 18 √ó 133 mm with a mass of 250 g) and more expensive: for the younger model at the start of sales they asked for $ 185, while for the flagship it was already $ 250. And as practice has shown, the benefit for the end user is minimal.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, formally, SSHD and, all the more, DRAM-based hybrids provided dozens of times faster access to files, but only to those that were in the device‚Äôs cache. A selection of relevant data was carried out by an intelligent firmware algorithm, analyzing which files the user accesses more often. This approach worked great when the hybrid was used as a system disk in a PC or laptop: the operating system and utilities used in everyday work really loaded in seconds. If the mobile storage was used in a similar way (for example, the owner wore portable versions of the necessary programs on it to always have the familiar working environment at hand), then the download speed increased noticeably. However, if an external hybrid drive played the role of, for example, multimedia storage,all the advantages of this approach came to naught, because the files that the user last opened got into the cache, because the algorithm could not predict what exactly a person would need at the next moment in time. Alas, this evolution branch turned out to be a dead end, and, as a result, hybrid external repositories simply stopped being released.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Western Digital Portable SSDs: Impressive Performance and Extreme Data Protection</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After all the ups and downs, the mobile drive market segmented quite clearly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is the smartphone out of memory? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Buy an SD card. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Need compact storage for everyday work files? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Use a flash drive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you travel often and want to have an entire library on hand, but don‚Äôt want to spend too much? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Get a roomy and relatively inexpensive hard drive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If performance comes to the fore for you, pay attention to solid-state drives.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, as you know, appetite comes with eating. Every year, user requests are growing, and satisfying them is becoming increasingly difficult. Modern SSDs must be not only capacious, compact, ergonomic and provide a high data transfer rate, but also must withstand high loads and reliably protect electronic components from environmental factors, ensuring the safety of user information. Although due to the design features, SSDs themselves are quite resistant to extreme impacts, which is explained by the complete absence of any mechanical parts, often this is not enough, and then everything depends on the quality of the case itself.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Following the merger with SanDisk and G-Technology, Western Digital's portfolio includes several lines of highly secure portable SSDs: WD My Passport SSD, WD My Passport Go, G-Drive Mobile SSD, G-Drive Mobile Pro SSD, Sandisk Extreme Portable SSD and Sandisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is the level of shockproof protection - one of the key parameters that distinguishes these devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, each of the listed series occupies a well-defined niche and is focused on its target audience.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WD My Passport SSD</font></font></h3><br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7m/wg/2p/7mwg2pqxnoa-1kes6ebj0rguu_8.png"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
WD My Passport SSD is a state-of-the-art portable shockproof drive. The robust polymer case protects the device reliably even when dropped on a hard surface from a height of up to 1.98 meters. Support for the USB 3.1 interface in combination with a sequential read speed of up to 540 MB / s allows you to use this model not only as an external storage of information, but also in non-standard scenarios, for example, to run an image of a virtual machine, so you can never part with the usual work environment no matter where you are.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the hallmarks of the WD My Passport SSD is its unique design. Western Digital worked together with Fuseproject agency, specializing in the integrated design of visual solutions for a variety of products, including consumer electronics, over the new look of the Western Digital drive series.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tj/qn/br/tjqnbr73zsoek_aeqyepa2_h15a.png"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The case of the updated My Passport is divided by a transverse line into two equal parts: the bottom turned out to be solid and embossed, the upper, on the contrary, is laconic and strict lines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This concept represents the intersection of two areas of our lives - physical and digital, at the junction of which lies the Western Digital brand, combining two so dissimilar worlds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such symbolism was not chosen by chance, because today information is already more than a simple sequence of bits, and each such device becomes no less expensive for us than the thoughts, ideas, memories that are stored on it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WD My Passport SSDs are aimed at those who are clearly aware that the form is inextricably linked with the content, and for whom even such a utilitarian thing as a mobile data warehouse is an integral part of the image.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WD My Passport Go</font></font></h3><br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uz/fk/a0/uzfka0rr35cu0pax58z4imqlpoo.png"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
WD My Passport Go is a compact drive that fits in your bag or pocket. It is ideal for those who spend a lot of time on the road or whose work is associated with constant moving. Robust polymer case with a rubber bumper around the perimeter reliably protects the drive from shock. He is able to successfully cope with strong vibrations and even withstand a drop from a height of 2 meters. The drive is equipped with a non-detachable USB cable (USB 3.0 Type A interface), the output of which is recessed in the case. A special slot is provided for laying it in the bottom of the SSD.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/c2/cf/eec2cfpckwr7uq1sktd4eqpylse.png"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This approach, on the one hand, makes the device even more ergonomic and convenient to use (you no longer need to carry an extra wire with you, risking losing it), and at the same time eliminates the possibility of a cable breaking at the base during rough handling. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A data transfer rate of up to 400 MB / s allows you to download the most voluminous files in a matter of seconds or improve your gaming experience by connecting the drive to the console (it works with Playstation 4, Playstation 4 PRO, Xbox One, One S and One X). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, the potential of My Passport Go is enough to meet the daily needs of most users.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sandisk Extreme Portable SSD and Sandisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD</font></font></h3><br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2o/lh/t6/2olht6z1qhbabwjhiln-qpskaqy.png"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The devices of these lines are designed for those who lead an active lifestyle and work a lot in the "field" (photographers, videographers). They are distinguished by a compact, ergonomic design: the dimensions of the Sandisk Extreme Portable SSD case are only 93 √ó 50 √ó 9 mm, and the dimensions of its older brother, Sandisk Extreme Portable Pro SSD, are 112 √ó 58 √ó 11.5 mm. The drives of both rulers received a durable rubberized case of a special design, which reliably protects the electronics from impacts up to 1500 g, as well as from dust and moisture (IP55 class - dustproof design, able to withstand directed water jets). The presence of a special eye makes it possible to conveniently hang the SSD to a backpack or belt, using a mount type "carabiner".</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/of/yl/d-/ofyld-p158p5sf-wsz9sc-0nxyo.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With a capacity of up to 2 TB and a bandwidth of 550 to 1050 MB / s (in the Pro version), you can process high-resolution photos, edit videos on the go, or take your favorite FLAC music and movies in 4K with you on a trip. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Sandisk Extreme Portable SSD comes with a USB Type-C cable with Type-A adapter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Combined with support for the USB 3.1 Gen 2 interface, this allows you to connect the drive to any PC, laptop or mobile device, including older models.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">G-Drive Mobile SSD and G-Drive Mobile Pro SSD</font></font></h3><br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fe/k9/aw/fek9awje99kyoujgbmpveoh0vfa.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
G-Drive Mobile SSD and G-Drive Mobile Pro SSD are aimed at those who value reliability and truly value their data. A key feature of these devices lies in unprecedented protection: they are able to withstand loads of up to 450 kg and a drop from a height of 3 meters. At the same time, the dustproof enclosure successfully protects SSD components even for short-term immersion in water to a depth of 1 meter (protection class IP67). The aluminum core and the special case design provide effective heat removal from the controller and memory chips, eliminating their overheating and guaranteeing constant performance even during prolonged operation, although for this the drives had to be made a bit bigger and heavier.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
G-Drive Mobile SSD demonstrates impressive performance among mobile devices of its class: data transfer rates of up to 560 MB / s in sequential read operations allows you to instantly save, edit and archive files of almost any size. Each cable comes with two cables (USB-C / USB-C and USB-C / USB-A), which, in combination with USB 3.1 Gen 2 interface support, ensures their compatibility with any client device, be it a PC, laptop or the tablet. A proprietary backup utility and compatibility with Time Machine allow you to create backups of important files in just a couple of clicks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The G-Drive Mobile Pro SSD is by far the fastest portable SSD. Possessing all the advantages of the original G-Drive Mobile SSD, the Pro version is capable of boasting a record data transfer rate of up to 2800 MB / s in sequential read operations, which makes it possible today to work comfortably with multi-threaded 8K or 3D video or copy terabytes of information in a matter of minutes! Record indicators were achieved through the use of the native NVMe interface in combination with the third generation Thunderbolt, which has a bandwidth of up to 40 Gb / s (i.e., about 5 GB / s).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An important nuance: the design of the connectors Sandisk Extreme Portable SSD, Sandisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD, G-Drive Mobile SSD and G-Drive Mobile Pro SSD does not violate the tightness of the case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In practice, this allowed not only to improve the protection of drives, but also to get rid of rubber plugs, widely used in other similar devices, which are not reliable, having the ability to break apart over time, and look, frankly, not particularly presentable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, if your device gets under water, before connecting it, you just need to thoroughly dry the connector.</font></font><br>

<h2> SSD- Western Digital    </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to these lines, Western Digital's portfolio includes two fairly niche series of solid state drives: WD_BLACK P50, which will appeal to fans of computer games, and WD My Passport Wireless SSD, aimed at those whose work is connected with the production of photo and video content. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's consider each of them in more detail.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WD_BLACK P50</font></font></h3><br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nv/wm/ja/nvwmjaekwjou5afdywyedc4856c.png"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The WD_BLACK P50 line was created specifically for the needs of modern gamers. The drives of this series have a record data transfer speed among devices with a USB Type-C connector - up to 2000 MB / s, which was made possible thanks to the support of the USB 3.2 Gen 2 √ó 2 standard, which simultaneously uses two USB 3.2 Gen 2 lines, with a throughput of up to 1000 MB / s each. Such impressive performance allows you to significantly improve the performance of even the most ‚Äúheavy‚Äù games of the AAA category and forever forget about the long downloads of locations, freezes in the open world and unstable framerate. When developing the WD_BLACK P50, we tried to cover the widest possible range of devices, so that you can "pump" not only a gaming computer or laptop,but also any modern game console, regardless of version (supports work with Playstation 4, Playstation 4 PRO with firmware 4.50 and higher, Xbox One, One S and One X).</font></font><br>

The WD My Passport Wireless SSD is a truly unique design, balancing on the fine line between a conventional portable SSD and a multi-functional mobile gadget. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The case, which reliably protects the disk from breakage when falling from a height of up to 1 meter even during operation, high data transfer rate (up to 390 MB / s in sequential read operations) and compatibility with PC and Mac is just the tip of the iceberg, because this model has a whole a number of additional features that will appeal to the owners of mobile gadgets, professional photographers and videographers, and even moviegoers!</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The built-in SD card reader allows you to back up photos and videos from memory cards directly to disk at speeds up to 65 MB / s, without using a computer or additional software.</font></font></li>
<li>  WiFi,   802.11ac/n,          4K         My Cloud.</li>
<li>          :       SSD   FiLMiC Pro     LumaFusion.</li>
<li>    RAW           ,           .</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Work in Power Bank mode: a capacious battery of 6700 mAh, designed for 10 hours of battery life, allows you to use the WD My Passport Wireless SSD to recharge mobile devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The drive is capable of delivering amperage from 0.9 A (when the SSD is turned on) to 1.5 A (in standby mode).</font></font></li>
</ul><br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/vy/ob/czvyobrcdc2zfq1j4q65z74jdeo.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All of the above makes the WD My Passport Wireless SSD an almost indispensable companion for professional photographers, videographers, travelers, bloggers and journalists. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By purchasing this device, you will have at your disposal not just a mobile drive, but a real ‚ÄúSwiss army knife‚Äù for effective work with content.</font></font></div>
