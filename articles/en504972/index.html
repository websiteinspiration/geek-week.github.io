<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the increase in the number of gadgets, the development of the throughput capacity of cellular and wire networks and the advent of ever new information technologies, the volume of the data economy is growing exponentially. And with it - and the opportunities that working with big data opens up. Working with a big date changes absolutely every area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman activity before our eyes - from entertainment to healthcare, from security to food.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now, when a significant part of humanity in one form or another is quarantined, self-isolation, and even in a situation of economic uncertainty, it's time to look at what role big data already plays in our lives, and most importantly - what role they will play in the near future the future.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Content and entertainment</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Big data determines not only which movie or series to offer you to watch next, but also which films to shoot for you. Hollywood has come very close to using big dates when writing scripts and casting actors, but so far it‚Äôs only at the beginning of the journey. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c75/b7a/1be/c75b7a1beb4ed70a30499ffe17960bca.png" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúJust imagine what will happen when Hollywood really starts using big data,‚Äù </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">says</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Richard Marashi, chief analyst at IBM. The traditional film industry, according to Marashi, uses the quadruple model, dividing the audience by gender and age - under 25 and over 25. But this is already changing. Big data allows us to divide the audience into unprecedentedly accurate segments - like housewives from regions who like comic book movies.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And it is completely optional to be limited only to segmentation and analysis of the audience. Big Data allows you to work in this way with the content itself. For example, Netflix analyzes and sorts its huge library of content for more than 70 thousand characteristics. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The combination of these approaches - a detailed analysis of both the audience and the content that it consumes, opens up unprecedented opportunities for creating new content. This is data that movie, TV, and game producers around the world can use when creating new worlds, writing new scripts, and casting actors. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Scripting consultants, in Hollywood slang known as Script Doctors, use not only literary education, but also </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">data analytics</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">both from box office successes and box office failures, weighing the investment risks of new scenarios sent to them by studios. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Following the film and television industries, big data is changing the world of music. Cloud services, from Apple iTunes to YouTube Music, operate with huge amounts of data about user preferences and habits. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Do you know, for example, that, according to the SoundCloud service, the average age when people cease to be interested in new music is 33 years old? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, in addition to interesting facts for self-digging, big data opens up new opportunities for business, allowing you to quickly find new talents and give them a pass into the world of big stars.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Big data is changing all areas of the creative industry. The latest sensational event in the podcast world - the announced ‚Äúmove‚Äù of Joe Rogan's podcast, Joe Rogan Experience, to the Spotify platform is valued at least $ 100 million. At the same time, the content of the Rogan show itself, both the entire archive and all new releases, will be completely free for users of the Spotify platform and application. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to many analysts, the goal of an expensive ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù is just access to the data of a multimillion audience of listeners of the show: their tastes, interests, preferences and habits. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sport is another area in the world of entertainment that is on the verge of an information revolution. Football teams in the UK </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"were spotted"</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in using smart sensors to measure the position of their players on the field and their heart rate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this is only the beginning: many basketball and baseball teams analyze the data of video recordings and sensors of both their players and opposing teams, turning the battlefield of muscles and spirit into a battlefield of data. </font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You will be full of data: big date in agriculture</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sensors and sensors, video surveillance and wearable devices are becoming a reality not only of human life, but also of agriculture. The Climate Corporation, a division of agro-giant Monsanto, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">works with agricultural holdings</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , farms, and retail software developers to integrate them into a single powerful data-based Climate FieldView network. Climate FieldView provides farmers with a detailed visualization of agricultural production processes, combined with data on food market needs that enable them to make effective informed decisions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Farmers have access to data on weather, soil conditions, moisture, fruit ripening, growth progress and livestock conditions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This information allows you to maximize and optimize production for the needs of the market in real time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, farmers often had to destroy harvested bread and pour milk out of milk. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the help of big data technologies in the 21st century, such problems can be avoided and the need for such dramatic measures will no longer exist. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thanks to big data, the Internet of things and cloud technology, better products are becoming available to an increasing number of people.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trade and advertising</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Online shopping can already be considered a traditional and predictable way to apply big data. Amazon was one of the pioneers in the use of big data in online sales, comparing purchases made by their users, comparing them to what others bought and trying to predict what their customer might need or want to purchase next. Now these technologies are used in almost any large online store.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Online advertising is another important big data application. Perhaps big data will be able to "kill" ads in its usual sense. After all, what do people usually call advertising? Intrusive reporting of something unnecessary. But at the same time, all people have needs and problems, in search of a solution for which we spend a huge amount of time and effort. Advertising that meets exactly the user's needs is no longer advertising, but useful advice. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But in order to reach such a level of utility (having lost the unpleasant ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù along the way), marketers need to know their customers better than they know themselves. Businesses are looking for their customers and are literally trying to guess their desires based on the sites they visit, their purchase and search history.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The result of this will be a little paradoxical: having become, thanks to big data, intuitive, advertising will cease to be perceived as something negative - just the world around you will be perceived a little kinder to people, always ready to come to the rescue and offer exactly what a person needs or needs here and now or in the foreseeable future. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Gamification is another important trend in modern marketing. Gamification includes elements of game behavior in everyday non-game actions, allowing people to be involved in seemingly not the most interesting processes, encouraging them to participate in them deeper and achieve more. One of the oldest examples of gamification is the flight miles accumulation program, designed to accumulate and retain regular airline customers.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To make loyalty programs more effective, companies need more data about the needs and intentions of their customers and their behavior. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, as a result, companies learn to offer their customers not only what they need, but also in the most friendly and fascinating way.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safety</font></font></h2><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7d/1f6/eab/b7d1f6eab5c754bddde005a41c6fdeae.jpg" alt="image"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Have you ever, when trying to pay for your purchase with an online card, receive a call from your bank‚Äôs security service? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, this is a positive signal - after all, this means that the security services are really working. Security, however desirable, comes at a price. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As the </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">analysis of the behavior of 20 million cardholders </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">showed</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , in the case of two such incidents during the six months when the transaction made by the user was taken as suspicious, the costs of the ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù card decreased by an average of 15% in the next six months, and every fifth the holder completely stopped using it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For businesses, it is important not only to fight fraud, but also to make this fight as less noticeable to users as possible. Big data analysis using machine learning allows you to create models of ‚Äúgood‚Äù user behavior, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">says</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Kurt Long, founder of FairWarning, a data protection company. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The more data, the more efficiently the network catches predatory fish, allowing ordinary users to enjoy safe navigation in the ocean of financial transactions. Thanks to working with big date, modern banks catch not only fraudulent transactions, but even </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">identity theft</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> before they occur.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, people's online security needs are not limited. Working with big data literally makes city streets and homes safer. Residents of megacities from London to Moscow are already used to the fact that virtual police through the cameras look at what is happening literally on every corner. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, this gives rise to many problems of the new era, including concerns about the protection of personal data and all kinds of abuses. But there is no denying that simply attacking a civilian and hiding in the dark has now become much more difficult. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The future of big data security is a predictive rule of law. Not like in the movie "Minority Report", of course - much more extensively. And more effective. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúStop - it works‚Äù</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Big Brother helps identify the most criminogenic areas, the time and place of the increased criminal threat - and take all necessary measures: from the banal "policeman at the corner" to investments in social networks and the formation of disadvantaged regions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Health and Medicine</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic crisis around the world, this topic is particularly relevant. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Big date has already provided significant breakthroughs in healthcare: the collection, exchange and study of data accumulated by scientists and practitioners moves research forward, and it allows improving medical development, diagnosis, treatment and patient care. Across the world, including Russia, digital cloud is replacing thick paper medical records. But the collection and processing of data already seeking medical help is not the most important change that work with big data brings to the care of people's health. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The best treatment is prevention. And here, work with big data is carried out on two large fronts: individual and state.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At an individual level, the accumulation of both data from researchers and statistical data of wearable devices allows you to track the risks of diseases and recommend the necessary checks and physical activity. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the state level, the contribution and importance of big data in healthcare is even greater, allowing you to monitor the risks and threats for entire populations, planning the development of medical infrastructure and even social and economic policies. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, in the midst of a pandemic, the importance of big data has grown by an order of magnitude. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are two ways to defeat an epidemic without waiting for a large part of humanity to be ill: by developing a vaccine or medicine against coronavirus - or by taking control of its spread. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In both cases, work with large amounts of data plays a huge role.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The development of a vaccine, the potential demand of which is billions of people, is a very large-scale task, which includes many rounds of clinical trials, from small groups of volunteers to many thousands of people in the final stages of testing. In a pandemic situation, this requires the coordination of laboratories across the planet, involving the exchange and processing of a huge amount of data.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even more important is the role of big dates in controlling the spread of coronavirus. As experience has already shown, many cases of outbreaks are associated with super-events, when a mass infection began in a certain place or during some big event. For example, the last noticeable outbreak of disease in South Korea was caused by only one person who, being an asymptomatic carrier, infected hundreds of people during a weekend of parties in the club quarter of Seoul. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, many countries of the world, from Germany to India, are already releasing applications that allow one way or another to track the movement and social contacts of users, so that in case of detection of a disease in one of them, in time to warn about the need for self-isolation of other people.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fact, working with big data makes quarantine smart by minimizing the effects of the pandemic on both human health and economies. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The complexity, scale and duration of the development of the vaccine, its launch on the market and vaccination of billions of people around the world means that the threat of coronavirus does not pass quickly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to scientists, before mass vaccination is still at least a year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But to put the economy of the whole world on self-isolation for more than a year will not work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Smart quarantine with the control of the spread of the virus through work with big data is the main thing that will help humanity survive the time remaining before the appearance of an effective means of combating the coronavirus itself.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The physical embodiment of big data</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Big data is, first and foremost, mathematics, but working with them does not have to be limited only to abstract thinking. Other ways of perceiving can also help. Big data is already closely connected with other powerful new products: cloud technology, the Internet of things, robotics, the growing strength of AR and VR technologies. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And visualization of big data is a separate interesting area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork with them. 3D printing technology comes to the rescue. Here, for example, looks like the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">visualization of the keys by frequency of use:</font></font></a><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ec/b5c/48b/6ecb5c48b9fe91410c9605ac369741b5.jpg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This, of course, is, so far, in the literal sense, toys. But, like many other technologies of this review, they have a great future. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What do you think are the big data applications yet?</font></font><br>
