<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It’s also a very long story.</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2015, I graduated from a middle university with a linguistic diploma. I didn’t really want to work, I didn’t know who I wanted to be, but I really wanted to buy good things for myself, so I had to look for work. Motivation, of course, is so-so, but as it is. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I started going for interviews, but I didn’t succeed. And then my mother suggested I get a job in her restaurant (small, family and Italian) as an administrator. The arguments convinced me: I can handle the job, I will have a good income and in parallel I will be able to look for work. I scratched the back of my head, drank up my compote and said my decisive “Come on!”.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is an important indent: restaurant business is a complex business that requires dedication and involvement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People are building dizzying careers, but I am past all this by a crocodile. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was an ordinary administrator, without goals and prospects in this matter. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g6/yf/8g/g6yf8grrqlwrm-wxgu4lcgjytvk.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I went to work, and she was a complete hell. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She took a lot more than she gave. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the view of many, the restaurant administrator is a man in beautiful clothes who impressively drinks cappuccino and tells the waiters how the napkins should lie. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In reality, it’s not at all like that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, I had an idea about this, but all even the worst assumptions were not such a nightmare.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How I worked at the most unloved job in my life</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For the first two months everything was fine: the cooks in the kitchen did not cheat on me, I giggled with the waitresses, behaved like a shy sheep, tried to do my job and received the first money. It was a warm autumn and everything was, in principle, good. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In parallel, I found a second job as a trainee in a local architectural magazine with a salary of 5 tr At first I liked it, but after a month, I realized that I was tired, the work as an intern turned out to be difficult, I didn’t like it there and I thought that I didn’t care, I would find something better. This was most likely a mistake. If I stayed to work in the magazine, I could learn something new and better realize myself at that time. But I wanted to drink wine with my girlfriend, watch movies and do not care about anything. Well, ok. She herself chose this path.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I continued to look for a more interesting job than the admin in the restaurant, but I did not succeed. They didn't even call me for interviews. December was already in the yard, and I decided that I would winter in a restaurant, and there I would already be thinking about a career. OK. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then the fun began. As it turned out, the staff behaved cute just because I’m my mom’s daughter. But when they heard that I was harmless and that I could be sent, they started sending me. Just like this: "You went right there!" It should be understood that I interacted with people who have been working as waiters and cooks for many years, they are tough and grasping. I was destroyed every day. Of course, then I got bruised, stopped making friends with everyone, and became a strict admin and tried to somehow discipline my shift, but it was difficult for me.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, I was not the best administrator. I called myself the administrator from hell. I didn’t like the whims of the guests, I didn’t shed many nuances, I did not know how to extinguish conflicts and did not leave a bad mood at home. I did my work and tried to do it as best as possible, but it was not good for me. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Moreover, the work of the administrator is quite dirty. Besides the fact that you are responsible for the cash desk, you are trying to control discipline, are disposing of petty affairs and so on, you are also responsible for ensuring that it is clean. Sometimes people did not have time to do their work, and they had to do it themselves: wash the floor, wipe the surfaces, sometimes take out the trash and so on on the list. My things smelled like a canteen and this smell could not be washed off, even my bra smelled and washing did not always help. And I was all 12 hours shift on my feet.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I also had to make sure that people did not break. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Work in the catering, the thing is complicated and sometimes it was necessary to let the washing machine cry, to listen to the problems of the waitress’s personal life, not to pay attention to the cook’s rude answer and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, this work requires physical, mental and moral returns. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the saddest thing is that everyone seems to be doing nothing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I felt like a failure, I wanted to realize myself, do something more interesting than wipe the glasses and keep the cash register. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the time has come when I realized that I needed to run away.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did i run away</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It took me a year to completely get away from this job: then I not only wanted to run away, but to find something that I would like to do. And I began to search. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r8/h8/ul/r8h8ulzbnaoiijuzctkrgq4onhu.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At that time, I worked in Restica for about 7 months, and when I was interviewed by a fairly large company for an internship, I was happy. This was the position of assistant Bayer in a very good place. For Peter especially. It was not a brand, but a luxury clothes purchaser who sells them in an expensive store on Nevsky Prospekt. The work was related to contacting brands, helping with the organization of business trips, and other things that the assistant does. Sn was 25 tr, which is much lower than what I received in the restaurant, but I did not care, I really wanted to work there.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After 3 days, they told me "You're done, but no." Pa pa pa foot. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Because I did not have work experience in the office, I was completely green (I had to work in a magazine, these skills would be useful to me!) And unsure. But shtozh, I wiped my nose and continued to search further and worked in Restica.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Failure followed failure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I ran interviews (many of them were even crypto, but if I start to tell everything in detail, you will age while reading), but nothing worked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, after a month and a half I found an interesting job, but temporary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I got an administrator at the World Cup in hockey and it was super. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was a lot of fun, active, there was a cool team and despite the fact that I had to work every other day with a schedule from 8 AM to 11 PM, I flew to this work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But all good things come to an end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And after 1.5 months I was back in the restaurant. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And she continued to search. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the beginning of August I found a job.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How I worked on the most nervous job in my life</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Work in Restika was not a flower, but in the studio I came across such a toxic level that I did not even dream of. But let's take it in order. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Koroch, my name is on the social network in the design studio. Speaking rudely, this is an atelier for women of rich men of St. Petersburg. Then, for some reason, I wanted fashion to become my professional (although I myself have never been a fashion), and I immediately grabbed onto this work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But it is understandable: working in a beautiful office, around flaps of clothes, not raw salmon, and the work itself was very interesting. My task was to control the entire process from creating a sketch to issuing clothes to a client. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The whole irony is that I was also very actively sent to this work, also in the literal sense. Rzhaka watch to the end.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To the question “What is this sketch?” (created even before I arrived and lying on the table), they said to me “yes a simple sketch”. And then it turned out that this was an urgent order. And they sneezed me for it in full. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They didn’t answer questions, they yelled at me, they told me that “I’m stuck a pair of scissors in my neck” because the fabric didn’t have time to come, they called me the worst words when I clarified important points. I was constantly told how badly I work, but for some reason they gave more and more responsible assignments. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are a lot of stories and I don’t have time to tell you all about this either. But I have a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">channel tg</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> where I throw off my stories and talk about how to find a job. The channel is new, there are now three people, but there will be more content and there I will tell you everything in colors and details.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, after I did an almost impossible task in the week, worked on the weekend, I came to work on Monday, earlier than necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And she gave the info to the main craftswoman from another craftswoman. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To which I received "B ** go to *** and never write to me again." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I realized that it’s not worth it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, I worked there for almost two months and earned the first and only panic attack in my life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, I just quit a job that I really liked and that I was very afraid of losing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that moment, I realized that my mental stability is much more expensive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Needless to say, they paid me less than promised and with a long delay.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What happened next</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I returned to Restik. Admins were needed there almost always and I was glad. I no longer took this work so emotionally, I just did it, knowing that this was not about me. And she continued to look for work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I realized that I would never come close to any fashion, and that I had to find something more serious. Something that will give me minimal experience and will be a good line in the resume. Since I have good English and have a thirst for travel (it will be ridiculous now), I realized that you can work in the visa center.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I just threw the resume to a company that is accepting documents for an American visa (not the consulate, but near it) and a week later they called me. After one interview, they called me. Brilliant prospects were waiting for me: for a salary of 25 tr I was asked to sit in a green synthetic dress in box number 10, check how people filled out their profiles, tell them three times that they needed other papers, send them evil home, and so on. And of course, there was no career opportunity. Well, maybe only if you get to the American consulate after three years (what is the irony that then all the consulates were closed).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But I understood that I had to sit here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At least six months to forever untie the restaurant flair and at least say something at an interview for my dream job. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I sat like that for 6 months. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The work was from 9 to 18.00 and it was very important for my boss that we should be at our tables at exactly 9. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I'm so disorganized that I sat down either at 9.03, or at 9.07. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was told that I have three strikes - if three times I will be in place after 9, then I will be fired. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, on a wonderful April morning, a week before my vacation, I still finished off the third strike. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh, I was upset then of course. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ib/u4/he/ibu4hedejlxlhhi_xhrv4u8o9tk.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In parallel with this work, sometimes, on Saturdays, I went to work in the restik. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because I don’t have enough money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when I lost that job, the beautiful restaurant doors were open again for me.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How I found my favorite job</font></font></h4><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I returned to Restik, it was cold May 2017 in the yard, but I clearly understood that this was the finish line on the path to my success. There were few changes in the restaurant, then I just moved from my parents and at the same time I found a part-time job in the showroom, so that I just have enough for at least something. Then my income was somewhere around 17 tr. Well, a couple more tears in the amount of 2-3 tr </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite the little money, sometimes I had a schedule like this - 2 days in restik, 2 days in the show room, rest day and all over again. I remember when I went through a test day in the showroom, I stood on the street after a shift, smoked and thought that I was a complete failure. I was 24, the job sucks, there is no sale, and there’s no money either. I was too old and tired for this shit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But I didn’t give up!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then it occurred to me that I had to go to IT. They say there is more money, the offices are pleasant and people are doing interesting things. She began to search and even went through several stages in a rather large building (we will definitely return to this word and to this place). But did not pass. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After a little howl to the moon, having received several more refusals, I thought that we should tie up with the show room and look for a side job more interesting. Type of translations and that’s all. Not to say that I had not tried before, it was just that nobody needed me.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So here. This rosin lasted about three months. One morning I responded to the post of a friend that he was looking for people to work part time with knowledge of English. He called me for an interview. For the best job interview of my life. I had a slight hangover (well, but before that there was a wedding of friends, I could not miss it), we drank coffee, chatted about life and in the end I was taken to the team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then it all happened. It was an IT startup, or rather, a blockchain startup that was just about to launch an ICO. It was 2017, even before the cue ball skyrocketed. With a cozy office in the very center of St. Petersburg, with a young team, with a good staff, interesting tasks and so on. Then for me it was a dream that came true.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And it was just an amazing time. I fluttered to and from work. I found good friends there, began to realize myself, went on business trips every few months, and met very interesting people. I had the opportunity to do something that I would never have done in my life: I was at a big conference in Barcelona, ​​went to Tel Aviv for talks, made a presentation in Moscow and Tallinn, organized an event in Helsinki and just got high in the office in St. Petersburg . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now it all sounds like a wonderful dream. It lasted a little over a year. Unfortunately, all good things come to an end. We failed the ICO.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We did not succeed and we made a lot of mistakes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I really appreciate this experience and really love this time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Needless to say, I was blissed out, especially in contrast to my previous experience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I worked there as a community manager and I had the opportunity to do everything myself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I myself organized my work, I myself was responsible and myself enjoyed the result. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, everything was blown away and next summer it was not so magical. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ultimately, it all ended up very ugly and very dramatic for me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They just told me one day that they could no longer allow me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without warning in advance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Refusing to pay what I earned (just sn for 2 weeks and vacation pay). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, we quarreled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And honestly, I just recently released this situation.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then there was work in a big corporation</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A month later, after going through many stages of the interview, I arranged a VERY large building (the same one that I hadn’t got a year earlier). They were engaged in crypto and blockchain, I got a community manager, but on more interesting conditions for me. And at the beginning, everything was fine. We had a small team, we worked on a small project and did what we thought was necessary (in terms of a working strategy, marketing, etc.). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was media about blockchain toys and for obvious reasons it didn’t shoot. But they took me to another project. Then they decided to cover him too. Then another one, which also closed. I felt like a black widow, but the fact is that in this building this was the case with many projects and almost all employees jumped from one project to another.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For a year I changed 5 or 6 projects. And there was a rather toxic environment. And a rather toxic head of corporation. Fortunately, I never came across him. He called everyone around idiots, brought people to tears and fired one day. Everyone was afraid of him. And he had many of his representatives: people who led a group of projects and broadcast what this person usually told them. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wi/vb/tt/wivbttkz1p12g4thj7blvazhoaw.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At some point, after a bunch of bruises in this office, I found my quiet haven. Despite the fact that it was one of the largest projects in the corporation, I managed to completely distance myself from all the squabbles and calmly work in my fun team. I also took corporate product manager courses. But, as always, all good ends.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They decided to close the project (yes, your mother!). The head of the corps requested a list of our team. I was not at that meeting, they did not call me. But they told me this: “He looked at our list, asked about everyone, you were the last on the list. He didn’t ask anything about you, he just asked who you were and told you to go very far. Yes, that's what he said. ” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, oddly enough, they did not fire me. Even a chat room was created called “Salvation is my First Name Last Name”. Where the people I worked with talked about why I shouldn’t be fired.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During these few days of my salvation, there were many conversations in smoking rooms and tea rooms with a variety of people: someone just supported me, someone said that this was all unfair, someone who had such an opportunity, collected from all my leaders reviews for me to leave me at work (I couldn’t do it myself) and someone that he himself took the initiative to “shoot” me, I quote. I was not in this chat and I do not know what was happening there, but in the end I was taken on a team by a person with whom I worked very little. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I was told that I have a week to give a result of work, otherwise I can leave. And then I thought that it was my time to send someone away. I said, okay, but I opened the resume.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, on the day when they told me that I can stay in the corporation, they made an offer for me in the company where I work now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Offer is 3 times cooler than what I had at that time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it was not a corpse! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I calmly said that finita is a comedy, litter.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What i have today</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today I am a supply manager at one educational site. This is something like a community manager, but I also do grocery things: I can figure out how to rebuild my personal account, or, for example, take part in creating onboarding. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My work is not perfect and I am unlikely to stay on it until the end of my days. But I have already learned a lot, I have adequate leadership and quite a lot of freedom. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have a good salary, but I don’t live a Fancy Life. But today I feel much more confident and calmer. I have come a pretty long way, have gained tremendous experience and, of course, this is only the very beginning. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But now, I’ve become more assertive, a little tough and just do not let some things happen to me. And I don’t work in Restica, and that's great!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The moral here is not that I quickly achieved success and now I live and do not bother. Rather, in spite of all the difficulties: as obstacles from the outside (in the form of inadequate bosses), as well as from the inside (features of a difficult nature), you can come to what you want. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And if now, just like I once did, eat McFlury and light it with a cigarette (you get a bottle of wine, just cried in the shower or what you still reassure yourself), you feel like a full day and disappointment, then know that this will not happen is always. Problems will not go anywhere, but you are able to do so to get away from what you want to leave now.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you were told no today, you will most likely be told no tomorrow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But after a week, it may be possible that they will say yes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Grab it, take your own and, if possible, send some people away, this is sometimes useful. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I wish you and yourself great luck!</font></font></div>
