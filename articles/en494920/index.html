<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(Grigory Oster)</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Let's talk about which developers the management dreams of. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This time I will act as an abstract manager ...</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the start of any project ...</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Did you know that the highest skill of a manager is to make decisions with minimal initial information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not stop us, leaders, from training this skill. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Follow these tactics:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Name the foggy dates, but rather do not talk about them at all. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we ask if the proposed improvements will not break the existing modules, be silent, in a pinch, make a mysterious facial expression!</font></font><br>
 </li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Talking about the upcoming problems of the project, never offer your solutions, remember, we need people-questions, not people-options-solutions. </font></font></li>
<li>       ‚Äî    ,       ,    ?  48-      ,       10 ,     . </li>
<li>   ‚Äî         ,    . </li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If at the stage of setting the task you were admitted to the client to ask him clarifying questions, learn from DDoS attacks - give all your best. The client expects from you at least 50 messages with questions, preferably in detail - he will appreciate your performance in the epistolary genre. You don‚Äôt need to attach any screenshots or videos - let them decrypt your message, even if it contains only ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù and a long ‚Äútyping ...‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Remember: the client and the end user are different people. Never communicate with end users and do not try to imagine them! If Aunt Masha at the checkout should see 25 lines of text on the monitor, calmly place them without looking at the screen size. Let the magnifier take if she does not like.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Never tell us what specific tasks will be solved within the project. Talk only about solution methods. And it is desirable in all details - how else would CTO sleep peacefully tonight? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In your story, by no means mention money, time, or other metrics that others understand. After all, even the director‚Äôs secretary can translate stories about the abstract structures used into user scenarios and the exact amount of profit that we get. So when evaluating tasks, use the most abstract system of quantities. Remember, 1 boa constrictor is 38 parrots!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Harvest as many surprises as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let besides time to solve the problem, it will also require paid subscriptions or tools, which we will not know about until the last moment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We love the pitfalls and will be happy to look for a way out of the deadlock before the release. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My client and I love to increase the allocated budget weekly, constantly coordinating it through all instances. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Drive Ivan Tsarevich through a new iteration from the beginning of the tale after each update of information about where Koshcheev‚Äôs death is stored.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perfect code ...</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Try to write only perfect code for the perfect code. It is not necessary to do this the first time. If in a hurry, write in a quick way, then redo and then again. Remember: repetition is the mother of learning. If the code has been rewritten three times and at least slightly different from the ideal, urgently start refactoring as part of a small task that does not apply to this. Better yet, transfer your code to another library or framework. Let the code be fashionable and youthful. The main thing is that in no case can all these processes be formulated as separate tasks. And then suddenly we guess that something was not ideal on the project? Things like this are best done just before the release. At this moment, the whole team is working much faster!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Speaking of refactoring. It will work more efficiently if you simultaneously change the mechanisms in the code - so as not to climb there twice. Remember, such processes should affect as many components as possible. Why spend time picking in individual modules? Only in this way will you end up looking like a hero who saved everyone! Other developers will be happy to discover the surprises of the new mechanisms when they shoot them in the foot.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The perfect code should be properly formatted. Try to create files of maximum size, occupying many screens and containing several components at once. Following this style of design, you can heroically overcome merge conflicts and for a long time agree with colleagues whose edits were more important. The code should resemble the longest noodles, no need to waste time creating small, insignificant files. For the sake of one function, invent a file name - what could be more painful? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The perfect code you created is not necessary to cover with tests. You can only talk about the need to bring coverage to 100%, but in reality 10% is enough. To keep up with you, add a couple of tests that in fact do not check anything, then they will not have to be updated.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If it suddenly turns out that a quickly written solution does not work or does not work as expected, feel free to blame the system architect, API, server administrator, etc. for everything. It is clear that your ideal code cannot but work. Remember the main thing: we, like you, know that an ideal programmer can only work in a vacuum in ideal conditions. And if you are distracted, do not give information on time, write incomprehensible TK, then you generally cannot be responsible for the fact that the implemented module does not fulfill the business task. Well, right, business is our responsibility. It is advisable to keep all the names of the guilty factors until the deadline, they will be needed later, now do not distract the leaders.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When we talk about the need to quickly release MVP, feel free to ignore our attempts to speed up the project to the detriment of quality and speed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, they know that with a good idea, you can start on the market at any time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Time does not play any role. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let the competitors shit, and when you write the perfect code, our MVP will soar in 5 years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And all these years, investors will be happy to pay for creating a masterpiece with their money.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The order in the project ...</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Your task is your personality. Creative mess will add weight to our eyes. The ability to build a mess and maintain it in a rather chaotic state is so valuable that we even transfer projects from hand to hand in order to increase the degree of disorder. As soon as the chaos reaches its maximum, we will reward you with a new project! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you understand that a full-fledged mess has formed on the project, but you have not yet been relocated, either start digging in your technical debts with your paws, or ask for another project yourself. Perhaps we just did not track the situation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everything that happens inside the team must go through us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if you decide to go out for a smoke with the tester, be sure to agree with him through the project manager, but it is better to involve CTO in this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We feel unnecessary if no one complains about our colleagues, doesn‚Äôt turn to solve disputes within the working group or introduce some work rules. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On design issues, it is advisable for us to write only in PM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This will hide all traces of our activity from the higher management, and at the same time will force us to retell the worked out solutions to other participants in the process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We love it so much!</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problem solving ...</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Once you have solved the problem or fixed the bug, in no case do not check your solution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shout ‚ÄúHurray‚Äù and run away from the workplace as quickly and further as possible! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So you will hand over the task faster and find the team a lesson for the first half of the next sprint - you will correct the jambs of the task just delivered. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is important, you also do not deprive the work of your fellow testers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A set of bugs caused by the new crutch in the solution is the best gift on Friday evening! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Check in your code only one successful case, you are an optimist. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The correct sequence of actions when solving a problem:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">read TK, ignoring notes, </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">have a smoke to forget the details, </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">quickly and without hesitation implement only the basic functions, </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">pass the task just as quickly </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Get revisions with clear decryption of unread TK notes, </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">so be it, fix the problem in 3-4 iterations. </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No refactoring in the wake, no combing of code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let the variables be called as your left leg wanted at the moment of insight, and the code remains poorly read. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs not for you to understand this later! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, train to take your code for review right away - you're a good, but touchy guy. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At this stage, it is impossible to create any evidence that the task has been completed (or they will sometimes come up with a video to write on the project how the module starts ...). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps the tester will not notice any discrepancies with the TOR, or else the task will be sent to another one, while for now you can relax on a new task.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If there are ambiguous moments in the task, for example, it is not known whether the input field should accept only English or Russian letters at the same time, feel free to answer the questions yourself, in accordance with your tastes and life experience. Since it is not written in the statement of work, this should be obvious to everyone! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And never test any hypotheses on a small part of the task, otherwise your colleagues will think that you are in doubt! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you are in a hurry with a task for release and understand that some functionality will need to be completed later, you don‚Äôt have to spend time setting a task in the project management system. It‚Äôs better to make a note directly in the comments to the code and do not tell anyone about it. So it will be even more interesting to catch technical debts. There will be a feeling that there are a lot of them and you are still very needed on the project.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Keep no more than half of the files in the project repository! No wonder so many different storage locations have been invented in the world. It is important to place the remaining files evenly between the personal repositories of employees and, for example, the documentation (not even necessarily for the current project). So ‚Äúsecret knowledge‚Äù about the project will be divided equally in the team and everyone will be irreplaceable. And then some newcomer to the project will come and figure it out quickly in the already implemented one. Something you can‚Äôt resist in their places - everyone will instantly be replaced with cheaper jones. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Every project should have secret knowledge that is passed from mouth to mouth. Only in this way can you take a sigh of a picture and, spitting, say: ‚ÄúOh, these junes have been working for a week, but they don‚Äôt know anything about the project. Stand back, do it yourself! ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you undertook to carry out any task from Jira, it is absolutely not obligatory to mark it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are mediums - we‚Äôll guess what you‚Äôre doing now, but at the same time we‚Äôll guess the current state of the project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, we can do this with the time spent - we don‚Äôt have to write anything anywhere, we will find out the number of hours worked and calculate your salary.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communication on the project ...</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Have you heard about omnichannel? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communication without dividing into different channels is the latest trend. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Be in trend! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For any questions, write PM to some messenger, it‚Äôs better personal, not a worker - so that he knows that you are not behind the latest trends of this world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But project teams in Slack and other messengers are best used to send funny pictures with cats and personal conversations.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Be late for regular meetings 15-20 minutes. Better yet, have a Soviet-era microphone and Wi-Fi away from the workplace. Let everyone listen to your croaking, it is like abstract paintings - everyone hears what he wants to hear. And at the Daily, you can ask all the questions that you have on the project. If there are not enough design issues, add more offtopic. At worst, you can always ask something abstract. Such a good example best reflects why you do not like phoning and why you better not attend them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, do not forget, every person has high-speed bluetooth in his head. Therefore, if you have already imagined everything in your head, then just transfer this picture. Words can explain only small details that were not visible in the picture. Let them try to understand you, this is their job.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, it‚Äôs worth to be late to the office if you work in our territory. This is the only way to create an impression of your importance. And never warn about being late. This will show that you were in a hurry, i.e. spoil your image of a calm guru. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you leave your workplace, you don‚Äôt have to bother with the arrangement of statuses in Slack or other instant messengers. Anyone who writes in your absence (and initiates a notification) will give a reason for a long and thoughtful curse that you are being distracted in your personal time. Where else would you find such a reason? And let managers and colleagues learn to accumulate their quick questions before the start of your official working day (there will be something to discuss in the day).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Exchange of experience is superfluous. Therefore, if you still post any link to an article or framework to the Education channel in Slack, you do not need to make any description for it. Let it be a quest for colleagues. They want new knowledge - let them strain and understand what you threw to them. And it doesn‚Äôt matter that this may not be their area. And in no case do not share your project observations, interesting decisions, bugs and instructive conclusions. Developer to developer wolf. You must compete, and not grow a common team experience! And yes, I almost forgot! If you find a lengthy article, then do not read it yourself, just lay it out to your colleagues, maybe they will be interested.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The work of fellow developers can and should be criticized. You have to find fault with every little thing. Just do not confuse criticism and review. It is necessary to criticize extensively and with taste (and preferably as abstract as possible, for example: ‚ÄúYour code is terrible‚Äù), but conduct the review as quickly as possible - click the green checkmark without looking at the code and leaving no comments. And then some constructive reasons for dissatisfaction will have to be formulated.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Transfer to us all responsibility for your motivation and advanced training. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are already resting for you, even helmet photos from different resorts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let us also come up with a motivation for you ourselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs clear that on the project all the tasks are interesting and only out of harm do we find a routine for you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And we arrange rush-offs on purpose, because you work better in this mode. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, we do not enroll you in courses either out of harm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You transfer all your needs to us via bluetooth, which is built into your brain, we receive them, but ignore them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No need to turn them into words, we feel them anyway.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Toward the end of the project ...</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When we ask you to show the project to the customer, in no case do not prepare for the demonstration in advance. It‚Äôs clear to everyone: if the project started on your laptop, it means that it is 100% working and will start anywhere. We are all lucky! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If, according to the results of the demonstration, the customer is unhappy, you will feel an impending conflict, you must send the customer to hell. He just doesn‚Äôt understand anything. And there is no need to inform the manager. By the way, a conflict with a client is the best reason to ask us for more money. We will gladly agree! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The release date is a fiction. We just love to mark these dates on the calendar. In fact, managers, especially on the remote, really lack communication. And postponing the release dates is the best way to quickly convene 3-5 meetings that people will not refuse to attend.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When the situation on the project is heating up, it's time to dissolve rumors that everything will soon collapse. Devote as many colleagues as possible to your assumptions, spread more negativity. If the rumors are justified, their distribution motivates us to correct the situation with the wave of a magic wand. And if not justified, we are glad that you are still in good shape. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, if the rumors do not help, start to panic in chorus. This is the most constructive solution. At this point, you can begin to talk nasty things about the company, not only inside, but also outside (for example, at interviews). This will definitely help to equalize the financial situation and get yourself strong colleagues in your colleagues!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Toward the end of the project, you can leave it loudly and effectively, articulating the reason for leaving as a too low salary, despite the fact that you have been on the project for so many years and for the sake of us do not touch new technologies. Feel free to go to the competitors - they will appreciate it. Our favorite quest is to search for new specialists a week before the release. When you leave for another company, do not forget about us. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Tell everyone about one side of the problem. Be silent about your ‚Äúexploits‚Äù, tell us about which managers are unfair. Do not try to understand us, tell outsiders. NDA came up with cowards!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All pitfalls should be reported only as a last resort - if the project cannot be put into production. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the best team building when the team jointly ‚Äúputs out the fire‚Äù on the night before an important release or already on production. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not deprive yourself and the team of this pleasure! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you still experienced a release in the team and something went wrong, you can safely put bugs on production at the end of the queue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They should have the same priority as everyone else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let them get in line! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, and know that on the night after the developer is appointed to the position of service station, deep metamorphoses occur with him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He forgets all the needs of developers, becomes short-sighted, authoritarian, stupid and inaccessible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we - managers, managers and service stations - so poorly understand you, the developers. </font></font><br>
