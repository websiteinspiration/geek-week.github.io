<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is an interesting profession in the world, a monetary, simple and very common profession - to transmit information. The people involved in it are fundamentally divided into two categories: secretaries and managers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the secretaries it‚Äôs clear their task is to ensure communication. For example, between the director and the rest of the world - call for a meeting, find a hotel, book flights, issue an order. There are also press secretaries, so they just broadcast on behalf of a person or agency - transmit information. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And in some strange way, the transmission of information crept into the midst of managers of various kinds. It seems that a manager is a person who manages something or someone. And here it isn‚Äôt - it just passes back and forth.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I must say right away: I myself am a manager. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes the manager will pass. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And not all managers are overpowered. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is such a caste, a subset of the normal managers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The article is not the cry of Yaroslavna, but an attentive, thoughtful and careful analysis of the phenomenon. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's look at a few examples.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Program Manager</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are companies in the world that provide software development / revision services. There, usually, programmers and transfer managers sit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The client calls, gets to the manager, and tells what he needs to do. The manager accurately writes and transfers information to the programmer. That's all for now. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The programmer calls back to the client and clarifies what he really needs. Well, it starts to do. If the programmer is lazy or inexperienced, he does not call the client, but asks the manager clarifying questions. The one what? Correctly, transfers information (questions) to the client. The client answers, the manager passes to the programmer.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then the programmer, of course, "goes into the bunker," in other words, solves the problem. The client sometimes starts to worry, and calls to find out how you are doing. To whom? To the manager. What does a manager do? That's right, it passes information to the programmer - well, like, what is it like. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The programmer mumbles something - or "is about to be ready," or throws a couple of new questions. The manager accurately writes and transfers information to the client. Well and so in several iterations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then, when the work is done, the manager solemnly calls the client and transmits information about this important event. True, the client already knows - the programmer showed him the result. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, the manager transfers to the client the data for payment - the amount, documents, etc. Well, neatly keeps records in the system. Everything, all the information is transferred where necessary, the work of the transfer is completed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It happens a little more complicated - for example, a client calls and tells a task that he needs to solve, and not what exactly needs to be done. The manager-transmitter will, again, act in its own way - transmit information. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, analytics, if any. Some managers, who consider themselves cunning, transmit information to several analysts and programmers at once, so that they think about implementation options, give an assessment of the cost and timing. Then the manager passes this information to the client - either all the options at once, or the cheapest. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The client thinks, asks clarifying questions - the manager accurately transfers them. Further according to the standard scheme.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If something goes wrong when solving the problem, the manager passes the information to the head of the programmers, or to the head of the company - complains, in short. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In response, he receives, for example, ‚Äútell him to shut up and do‚Äù - well, he transmits this information to where necessary. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Good profession. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Uncomplicated, the main thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A person with secondary school education will cope. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is advisable, of course, to transmit information as accurately as possible - here there are problems, because </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">often a dumb telephone is obtained due to the manager‚Äôs lack of knowledge of the elementary domain terminology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, ignorance of the differences between the operating system and application software, the Internet and the browser, etc.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Service manager</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A lot of transfers in the service, for example - in car dealerships, in the repair and maintenance departments. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I come to the official dealer - some boot has flown. The manager will give everything carefully records, picks up the car, I go to the waiting area to stare at the TV with the broadcast repair. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I see - the manager ran to the dude in a greasy robe, and transmitted the information. Great, it started. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After 15 minutes, I see on the monitor - the manager approached, received some information from the master. He reaches me, conveys information - you need to buy anther. The dealer himself, of course, does not have them - they have not heard about TOC. Ordering is about a month to wait, but there is a boutiques around the corner where non-original anthers are sold.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ok, I‚Äôm going to the store, buying, dragging, giving it to the manager, returning to the TV set. I see, I ran out, gave my boot, something is being repaired again. After 5 minutes, the manager appears on the TV again, and the master explains something emotionally to him. It brings information, apparently. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The manager comes running to me and transmits information that I bought the wrong boot. I say - what are you, I even wrote down what you need to buy. Well, yes, he says, I gave you the wrong information. It is necessary that one that is closer to the wheel, and I bought the one from the other end. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Okay, figs with him, the boot of 700 rubles was worth it, I'm going to buy another. I pass it on to the manager, the one to the master, the repair is completed successfully, I‚Äôm leaving.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And, no, not successfully. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the boot fell off again, and I arrived again. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The manager ran away, found out, and handed me the information that they sucked a drag, so he fell off. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I asked, maybe some special clamp is necessary - I ran away, transmitted the information, returned, transmitted the information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Named a specific brand of clamps, I bought. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is clear that without this guy in the car dealership was in no way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And so - everyone is mistaken. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I saw the resume of this guy - I wanted to become a June programmer.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Head of IT at the factory</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Approximately the same as the manager under the programmer, but with some significant differences. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The difference is number one: the chief of IT often contacts customers live, because they are sitting in neighboring offices. Therefore, he has a better developed verbal communication skill, and, willy-nilly, at least some knowledge in the subject area appears. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the essence of the work is the same - to transmit information. High-level customers, such as directors, their deputies, chief accountants, finders, etc. They don‚Äôt like to communicate with the lower classes - programmers, therefore they call the chief of IT to themselves for setting the task. The boss always has a corporate notebook with him, with a bunch of multi-colored bookmarks in which he writes down tasks, and then transfers them to programmers. Well, then on the thumb, drives information about the status of tasks back and forth.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes it acts as an additional contour of information transfer. For example, it runs, ass in the soap, and tells the system administrators that the server is not working. Thus, the system administrators who are already sitting and repairing the server. But the IT chief can not always visually determine that the system administrators are already fixing the server, so no one will tell him the truth - everyone solemnly receives important information from him. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The difference is number two, the key: the IT chief attends meetings. His main desire is not to get any new information there, because usually they don‚Äôt say anything good about IT at the factory. It‚Äôs ideal to sit silently in a corner, and when the turn comes, say ‚ÄúI have no questions‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before the meeting, the IT chief intensively collects information from his subordinates - what are the jambs, delays, in what status are the tasks and projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not because he‚Äôs done, but because he can be asked about this at the meeting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If he cannot answer, he will be charged with the worst accusation for the head of the IT plant. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Do you know how it sounds? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou do not own the information.‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is almost a death sentence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not only in factories, by the way - in the meetings of high government officials that are shown on television, this accusation also sounds often, and one can clearly see how a person is worried about him. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The life of an IT chief is somewhat more complicated than a service manager, because there are more nodes (between which you need to drive information).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IT Director</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This manager will pass level 80. He won't even pass it on. He is a translator and a scammer. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, if you look, an IT director is needed for the strategic management of IT infrastructure. If you recall that IT is part of the company, it becomes clear that the IT strategy is part of the overall strategy of the enterprise. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Formation of an IT strategy is carried out either by decomposition or translation. The point is not very different, the difference in approaches. Decomposition is a smart technical action, such as compiling an ISR, and broadcasting is something from the field of info-gypsy, like transmitting information in a distorted form. Accordingly, broadcasting is easier.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In short, the CIO goes to Big Meetings to discuss Important Matters, Strategy, Goals, Benchmarks, Future, etc. And when he leaves the Big Conference, he must broadcast the information received on it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Simply transmitting information is one-to-one, as-is, without loss or distortion (well, except for the cases described above). And broadcasting is like translating from the language of High Elves into the language of Dumb Orcs. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, the High Elves said: you need to reduce costs. CIO broadcasts: Vasya, I'm firing you. Or ordered at the Big Meeting to do digitalization, the CIO broadcasts: we buy ERP. And if you decide to develop services for electronic sales, the result of the broadcast will be ‚Äúbuy Bitrix‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then the fun begins - the reverse broadcast. Subordinates simply broadcast - they are obliged to listen and perform. Well, they told Bitrix to buy - we‚Äôll buy it. And how then to explain why e-selling services are not developing? And what is digitalization - they have not figured it out (by the way, did someone figure it out?), But they bought and implemented ERP. Instead of the dismissed, Vasya took two new ones, increased the costs by one and a half times (because Vasya was smart, but not demanding) - do not care, because the reverse broadcast on the topic ‚ÄúI cut costs‚Äù occurred immediately after the dismissal. They will not double-check later? It turns out a classic surrogate - did not do what was requested.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But CIOs are not discouraged, they have come up with a lot of ways to correctly broadcast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They know what to say, to whom, how to file it and, what is important, when. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The result, however, is usually deplorable, but this applies not only to IT, so our heroes are not to blame for anything. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, about the ‚Äúscammer‚Äù - it‚Äôs about the same as broadcasting, it‚Äôs just called differently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some High Elves like to say, "convey information to your subordinates." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not transmit, do not broadcast, namely report. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here, however, it sounds twofold. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the one hand, ‚Äúconvey‚Äù is a synonym for the word ‚Äúconvey‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, there is a suspicion that the High Elves are simply asking the CIOs to convey and not splash along the way.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, the CIO is the hardest. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to be not just a broadcast, but a broadcast translator. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">CIOs, you hang on there.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Summary</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is such a profession - to transfer information back and forth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Usually managers do this. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A manager will transmit to programmers in a company that provides completion services, it simply transfers information from the client to the programmer and vice versa. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The IT director at the plant transfers information in two ways: from customers to programmers and vice versa, and from programmers to the Meeting and vice versa. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main task is to own information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you own the information, you probably won't get fired. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The IT director does not just transmit information, he transmits it, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">translates from the language of the High Authority into the language of small cattle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most difficult thing is to broadcast back, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">present a thousand lines of code as an implementation of a company‚Äôs strategy. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Transfer managers are great guys. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Good luck and prosperity.</font></font></div>
