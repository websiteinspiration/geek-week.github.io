I. Kant</font></font><br>
</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, this quote is very suitable for programmers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, a programmer is not just a specialist who is well versed in technical issues. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A programmer is, first of all, a craftsman who creates code every day using his knowledge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Creating good code is impossible without the disciplined use of certain skills. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this regular use is what habits are.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It so happened that bad habits prevent us from living and working, and good ones increase productivity, and in general a person gets more pleasure from life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you make an effort and start acquiring and pumping good habits, you will very soon begin to notice how you become a specialist of a higher level. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But that's not all, your colleagues will also quickly notice changes for the better, and this will force them to learn and adopt useful techniques. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you work with code in a team, you can read the person‚Äôs attitude to work in each commit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, let's go through the eight useful habits of a programmer that will make you the best professional.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Do not repeat (DRY - Don‚Äôt repeat yourself)</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You probably came across the fact that, looking at the next section of code, you think: "Hmm, here I already did something similar, but with different arguments, and in general there was a different data array." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This should be a call to you that this code will be repeated in the future, again with small changes in conditions and data. But if you do not pay attention to this signal or are in a hurry, then most likely you will write the algorithm again from scratch when a similar solution is needed in the future. Gradually, such algorithms will accumulate, the code will grow, and in the end you will completely lose the motivation to make edits and improvements in such noodles.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, develop a good habit of following the DRY principle (Do Not Repeat). Whenever you catch yourself writing a similar algorithm, take the time to think over several possible options with different entities. Organize a small generic function or even a class if the algorithm is complex. This will take a little longer than writing a quick solution for a specific task, but it will save an incredible amount of hours in the future for debugging and testing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Gradually, a whole library of such blanks will accumulate in you, and you can easily use them in any project. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Programming as a whole consists of such small efforts that are performed in the process. Make yourself squeeze out a little more than what is currently required. Then you will begin to grow.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is a whole list of similar principles that are very useful to adhere to. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, in my opinion, DRY is fundamental for everything else in the work of a programmer.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Once you have decided that everything is done, refactor</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most programmers, especially beginners, believe that their work is done as soon as the code begins to perform the task as intended. Only now the word "made" includes a broader concept than the trivial writing of code. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Does the code work correctly? Yes! So what's the deal? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes that's right. Just before you move on to the next task, review what you wrote. From the beginning to the end. Most likely, you will notice that some variables are declared in an inconvenient place and it is not clear why they are needed. There may also be a too long line that does not fit into the screen, which means that here you need to think about how to make it more beautiful. Or the function turned out to be too voluminous and can be divided into a couple of parts.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Think about the people who will read your code in the future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether they like this code or no beer can‚Äôt figure it out. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Make a beautiful decision, not just a working one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just like good writers after writing a draft: they read their work several times and throw away unnecessary parts to make the reader like it and grasp the point without having to go into too much detail. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I highly recommend reading </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Robert Martin</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on this topic </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An enlightening book that should be in the library of every programmer.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Focus on business tasks</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many programmers tend to focus on studying the technical side of their work and believe that business has nothing to do with them. The main thing is to give good technical specifications, and then I will do everything in the best possible way. Only in order to become truly a master of your craft, you must understand why what you are doing has taken the business.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If it is very rude to imagine a programmer who works purely on TK without understanding the essence, then an example can be given. The bus driver, next to which the passengers sit and tell him: "Turn left, turn right, now right." And so the passengers ‚Äúdrive‚Äù the bus. But if the driver takes the initiative and asks: ‚ÄúWhere do I need to go?‚Äù, Then the passenger can simply say: ‚ÄúWe are going to the city N‚Äù, and everything becomes much easier. The driver knows the final destination and can, using his experience, independently build a route and tell himself where and how to turn.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Oddly enough, but many programmers do not bother to understand the purpose of the project. And, on the one hand, you can understand this point of view, because programming is a very difficult mental work. Sometimes knowledge of your instrument occupies such a large part in the mind that there is simply not enough resources for everything else. So it turns out that programmers, like drivers in a tank without a viewing window, can only turn the knobs when the crew commander hammer on them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, understanding the business problem will not let you plunge into the development of something completely unnecessary at a given time. For example, if the task is to make a function that helps to compile statistics when passing the tests, then, knowing that this is not a performance-critical task, you no longer need to spend time on unnecessary optimization and speeding up the algorithm. All the same, this will not affect the final result. Tests will only be run by developers, and only once a week. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another example, if the program has a function that all users run several times every day, it makes sense to spend more effort on working out the ideal version of this function and its ideal accessibility in the interface. Here you can already spare no time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, you see, from the point of view of a programmer who is not familiar with business tasks, both of these tasks will seem equivalent. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For a better understanding, I advise you to read the book </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúStart with Why‚Äù by Simon Sinek</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Small commits</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The fact that a programmer needs to use a version tracking system, I think, is obvious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want to talk about another very useful habit - this is to make commits as often as possible and in as small portions as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, add meaningful and useful comments to each commit.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Often, beginning programmers and even more experienced ones just at the end of the day make one push with all the changed files and some kind of useless comment like ‚Äúfix issue29‚Äù. Or "fixed a bug in the request." No one from such a description will understand what was done specifically. And when the time comes to merge such a large commit into a common branch, the owner of the repository, firstly, mentally obscures the lazy developer. Secondly, if a conflict occurs during the merger, it is likely that the owner will simply roll back this commit and not accept it. Who wants to get a portion of bugs from the fact that he misunderstood which condition turned out to be superfluous when manually resolving conflicts.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the other hand, if you regularly push your changes once an hour and provide each commit with a more detailed description, so that in the future it‚Äôs easy, without looking at the code, to understand what you changed and what considerations you had about these changes, then you will reach a new level of understanding of the general philosophy of writing code. Now you will not just ‚Äúrepair the primus‚Äù, now you will become part of the creative team and will communicate with your colleagues through your commits, just like in a chat. This will be a meaningful dialogue. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a literature, I highly recommend reading at least the first chapter from the book </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúGit for a Professional Programmer‚Äù by Scott Chacon and Straub Ben</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you find out what wonderful functions there are in Git and what it is capable of, then it remains only to commit more often, and the rest can be settled with the necessary tools.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Count the time</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Any work has a beginning and an end. The effectiveness of a programmer is measured in the number of hours necessary for him to solve certain problems. The faster the tasks are solved, the better. This is quite obvious and does not require any explanation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there is another side to this evidence, which often eludes programmers - you need to accurately calculate the time spent on the solution. Not what you feel when you sit at work from nine to five, interspersed with seals and meetings. And the present is your work. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the very beginning, I developed the habit of counting time by simply writing down reports about what I did during the day and figuring out an approximate time. Even then, I roughly calculated that I only get 4 hours out of 8 to work effectively.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then he installed special programs that counted the time automatically. At first I used </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">www.rescuetime.com</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Thanks to this program, I saw that social networks, although it seemed like a minor waste to me, actually really spoiled my performance picture. In the end, I decided to disable access to some sites completely during working hours. For this, there are also special plugins in the browser. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next step in time tracking was required when I decided to fix the exact time of work with the program code. For this, I first tried </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hubstaff.com</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . As it turned out, a rather expensive solution if you use it when working in a team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then tried </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wakatime.com</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it turned out to be that silver bullet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This service has the ability to integrate into all popular IDEs, as well as integration with github. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, you can determine with accuracy up to a minute how many useful minutes you spent programming. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, there is a binding to commits. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs just wonderful when you can see not only the commits themselves, but also find out the time spent on this commit. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An amazing collection of recipes for the correct organization of time and work on projects is in the book </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Jedi Techniques" by Maxim Dorofeev</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. Stability is a sign of mastery.</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As you probably already understood, you can endlessly develop your skills and abilities. What you did a year ago may seem ridiculous and unpretentious in terms of your new experience. You, of course, will have improved ways to write complex expressions. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But among all this, you must develop the habit of sticking to certain rules. Even if they do not seem to you completely worked out, use these methods of work everywhere. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Using the code example: if you decide to use a specific scheme for naming variables or use spaces instead of tabs, then follow this principle constantly. You don‚Äôt need to try a new style every week and try to apply new advanced practices. So you just lose your focus.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The problem with inconstancy is that time destroys any software product. The longer a few people work on the program, the more changes are made in the process, which ultimately create chaos. If each of the team members does not adhere to a specific agreement. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So what needs to be done to abide by the principle of constancy? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first thing you need to adopt is to adhere to a definitely style in the code. At </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">JetBrains</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> editors, I really like the tool that indicates the quality of your code. I used to be scared of so many warnings, but when you start to follow the advice of a linter in a disciplined manner, then the code becomes clear and aesthetically pleasing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also study the literature on how to name classes, methods, and variables. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I recommend the book "Perfect Code" by Steve McConnell. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At one time, I read this book for half an hour in the evening, when everyone else was already leaving home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The book was in the office library. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just a couple of months later, I saw all the horror that I had encoded before that time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I had to gradually introduce new techniques and conduct refactoring.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. Do it once</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúI'll fix it a little later.‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each of us pronounced this to ourselves when we encountered a bug in our code or an insufficiently correct condition for processing in a loop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And each of us knows that this "fix later" and then remains in the code in the form of comments</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">todo</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when you yourself see code comments in the style</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">todo</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, it only means that someone does not follow the principle of "do here and now." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the moment this comment was written, the programmer most likely very well understands what the problem is and how to fix it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because it is in the context of the current task. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you return to this section of the code later, it will be more difficult to understand why such a reservation was required. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, make a very important habit for yourself - to work out the solution from scratch until the task is completed in full. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most complete - because it is really unrealistic to cover all the options with one hundred percent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at least don't leave room for these</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">todo</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">-comments. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, if you came up with and took the time to comment, it means that for the next step - implementation - there is very little left. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A good way to understand that you really have finished this piece of code is to create a test to check for several incoming conditions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8. Never stop learning</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This, it would seem, is an obvious skill needed by any specialist, not just a programmer. But, unfortunately, many forget about him. Sometimes, I ask my friends who is involved in programming, what books they have read recently. Often, many begin to recall with difficulty what they read a year or two ago. At the same time, they mastered a couple of tricks at the university or at some courses and use it all the time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, if in such a rapidly developing sphere you stop at least once a month to get acquainted with a new tool, technology or an interesting concept, then after a while you may find that you literally do not understand what is happening in the present.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This happened to me once. I developed one successful product and sold it for a while. Of course, I heard stories about new frameworks, but I did not pay much attention to them. He was deeply immersed in the development and support of his solution.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Only when the flow of customers decreased did I realize that my product needed to be modernized. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then I ran into a huge barrier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I used to use only PHP and very rarely AJAX functions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And to understand the modern React, Angular, Vue JS frameworks, I needed to urgently spend about a year to study them through books. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most interesting thing is that if I had devoted enough time to training before, then my product would not lose competitiveness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was just that instead of supporting old functions, it was necessary to learn new ones and introduce technologies gradually, and not in such an emergency mode.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conclusion</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even if you are one hundred percent confident in your skills, remember that there is no limit to perfection. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not stop asking yourself provocative questions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Admit to yourself that in some areas you have insufficient training or you do not know the subtle points in the familiar frameworks, but you would like to know them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Spending a couple of hours and running the test version directly from github on the local server is now very easy. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In such small experiments, you will train your skills and develop all important habits.</font></font></div>
