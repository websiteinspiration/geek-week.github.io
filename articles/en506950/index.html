My name is Svetlana Infimovskaya, I am the director of School 21. I know that many of you have heard about her, and someone even participated in our qualifying pools. Moreover, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project, its methodology is not always correctly understood. It seems to some that in ‚ÄúSchool 21‚Äù one party, someone, on the contrary, considers it too harsh, while others are skeptical about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãteaching people how to develop without a fundamental foundation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I will try to talk about what ‚ÄúSchool 21‚Äù is, what is the specificity of the approach and methodology so that expectations from the school and the reality of learning come as close to each other as possible. You can go into the details of pedagogical design, but the essence of the School is precisely in its participants and atmosphere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From my own experience, I know that the methodology can cause skepticism, since at first it was so related to </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ecole 42</font></a></font><br>
<br>
<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lw/h9/om/lwh9omhcet80cdrrxd_urw4ae1c.jpeg"></a><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The French project, the franchise of which is our school. In Russia, Ecole 42 was talked about in 2017, when </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pavel Durov wrote</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> enthusiastically about it </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. I was lucky to get acquainted with the school four years earlier, in the first year of its existence. Under the cut, I‚Äôll tell you how from the opinion that the Ecole 42 approach is completely absurd, I came to the conclusion that I began to look for an opportunity to open such a school in Russia.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It so happened that I have known for a long time Nicolas Sadirac, co-founder of the original "School 42", from the time of his work in Epitech, a private French technological university, which largely became the prototype of Ecole 42. As part of Russian IT, I first approached the idea of snobbery. Is it possible for people who are trained in this format to write normal code? Plus, I have a great reverence for classical education. I told myself that I had to wait for the first graduates to be evaluated by employers. Although I had no particular doubts about their employment, since over the past 20 years we have all observed an exponential increase in the demand for IT specialists in all sectors. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Time passed, and in 2016, School 42 opened in </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">California</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. The leaders and founders of Twitter, Snapchat, Slack, Nest, Airbnb began to talk about it, write </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bloomberg</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The New York Times</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . People who studied in it began to join international companies, and employers were pleased with them. It turned out that for them, an employee who writes code that simply solves a business problem is already good. It was no longer a diploma of a top university, the guys were taken without a traditional base. Each year, the school trained almost a thousand junes by a team of 25 people.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In Russia, IT specialists also became necessary not only for IT companies. Industry, finance, telecom, logistics - the digital transformation has captured ever-larger industries. Neither classical higher education, nor even their own educational initiatives of Internet companies can still satisfy all the demand for personnel. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I got the idea to open Ecole 42 in our country, began to go out to various companies that could participate in this, and soon found out that Sberbank bought the franchise for Russia and made training free of charge in it. For my part, I expressed my readiness to help the project in every way.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is difficult to come up with a more boring and frightening phrase for a Russian-speaking person than the headmaster, but the point here is ‚Äúthe translator‚Äôs false friends‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In France, a ‚Äúschool‚Äù is a higher education institution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And one of the global challenges that the founders of Ecole 42 want to solve is to change the approach to the education of professionals and their mentality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So that they do not seek to earn the approval of the teacher or to receive the coveted credit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They should be able to bear responsibility for themselves and the results that future employers expect from them.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Four weeks of selection</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are no classic entrance exams at School 21, so you cannot prepare for admission. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For four weeks, applicants will be able to try to "swim the pool."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"Pool" is, on the one hand, intensive in programming, and on the other, a unique emulation of real life. Each of us has more tasks than we can do in a day; and the pool of tasks is more than you usually can catch. This teaches you to prioritize. You have deadlines every day - it teaches you to plan your time correctly. The system checks before the first error - this teaches you attentiveness, which is one of the pillars of programming. You have to check other participants, and they - you, which teaches you to communicate briefly and essentially with strangers. We have a dismissive attitude towards instructions in our blood - ‚ÄúSchool 21‚Äù shows the importance of this element in terms of saving time to achieve results.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a month, all these skills will become a habit, and the participant will be able to see an effect that is simply not achievable within one or even two weeks. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/qm/xm/9bqmxmizikjoy0j9au6anth994s.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my opinion, the pool is a trial period not only for applicants, but also for the School: a third of the participants leave in the first week. Someone does not fit the rhythm, someone is not ready for independence, someone is unsettled by mistakes. Those who reach the end, like 300 Spartans, only alive and seasoned in battle! One thing unites them - in spite of everything, they like to program. Of these, usually half become our members. Many of those who did not pass do not quit programming and continue their journey, but not within the framework of the School.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The pool is the period of the highest load for the entire training period. It is precisely those who dropped out at this stage who have the impression that the ‚ÄúSchool‚Äù is unbearably difficult. Often someone tries to combine this with work or study - nothing comes of it. Half of the participants here begin to program for the first time, and a third begin to master the English language, in which we have all the tasks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Those who did not even enter, but reached the end, a completely different opinion about the "pool" - as a fantastic experience of knowing and testing oneself. It is psychologically difficult for children with excellent student syndrome - there is simply no time to double-check everything and have time to do all the tasks. But so in real life, for which an ordinary school and university do not prepare us. Therefore, with us this is also part of the educational process.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We often discuss with the participants, which is more important: to bite into a problem, sorting it into pieces, or quickly penetrate and propose a solution? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no definite answer to this - companies need both. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some will be able to quickly make prototypes, the second - to bring them to mind. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z2/rq/oa/z2rqoaluwised5qu1yrkmvch3ry.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Whether or not to accept a person for basic education is determined by the dynamics of the applicant regarding himself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first four ‚Äúpools‚Äù, the participants themselves made classic ratings of applicants, and were surprised that they did not coincide with the result.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For those who have never programmed, the first two weeks are difficult, and for those who have studied or tried to code something, the last two. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Often those who are at first easy, show a negative trend and do not fall on further education, while yesterday's courier can become part of "School 21".</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Training</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These four weeks make a person take a fresh look at planning and their capabilities. ‚ÄúSchool 21‚Äù works without teachers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We do not have lectures, seminars or exams. We can finish training in one and a half years, but it is possible in three and a half. People who are accustomed to the structure set by a regular school, university or work from nine to six need to rebuild their consciousness in order to be productive in the conditions of such freedom and existing requirements. If you postpone the project until the last day, then you certainly will not have time to submit it. If you study without sleep and lunch, then in the end you will have no strength left. It changes people a lot.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All training is gamified. On the one hand, a student competes with himself, on the other, he is part of a team that changes every week. So the jokes about two points to Gryffindor and the distribution hat are all joked with us. At the same time, each student moves along his unique trajectory. You yourself choose the direction in which you will study. Now among the directions are algorithms, graphics, mobile development, Unix, system administration, cybersecurity, etc. But at the same time, if in the process you understand that the chosen direction is not yours, you can easily change the trajectory. For example, a lot of students chose the schedule, but, realizing its complexity, switched to another branch. You can go in several directions, but you can - in all at once.It all depends on the person and his ability to evaluate and overestimate his strength and prioritize.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All students must take and defend internships that they seek themselves without the help of the school. The first of them needs to start a maximum of a year after the start of training. The guys themselves write a CV, with which we help them, prepare for interviews, share life hacks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are 21 levels in the Ecole 42 methodology, but this does not mean that you can finish such a school only after reaching the coveted 21 level. Only you decide what your internship is - the final one. At the same time, almost everyone receives an offer following the results of the first, and here you have a choice where to study further: at school or at work. It‚Äôs important to understand that the speed of your career growth is directly proportional to how far you have advanced in your learning levels. Everyone has different life circumstances. There are students whose first offer after an internship exceeds their income from old work by several times. But if now a person goes to an overheated market, having left training, then he has great chances to get stuck in a junior position. All schools of the Association 42 are faced with this challenge. Since this year, we have been actively processing projects available after the first internship,We are developing educational intensives in new and popular programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãso that participants have no doubts that they simply need to continue learning.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If on the ‚Äúpool‚Äù you have tasks every day that you need to pass the next day, then in the main training you have deadlines from one to three months. You have to plan your time so that you have time to complete and test your project, pass the test by five other participants and the system. If you left everything at the last moment, there is a chance not to be in time and fly out. There is no classic ‚Äúacademy‚Äù in the ‚ÄúSchool‚Äù, all force majeure is already embedded in these deadlines. Of course, there are exceptions, for example, we are already waiting for five guys from the army, and two girls from the decree.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It‚Äôs important for us to give the participant acceleration, to restructure his attitude towards learning, to show the value of communication and community, to teach him not to be afraid to ask, try and make mistakes, to find his own way of gaining knowledge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Already more than 300 of our participants have taken internships in 50 companies, from ‚Äúblue chips‚Äù to startups. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is great, but I do not urge to rush to conclusions about success. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think that we can do them in three years, when the first graduates come to work, and we can look at their dynamics, relative to other students.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Peer-to-peer and the importance of communication </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main teaching method at the School is peer to peer. It consists in the fact that today you are checking someone, and tomorrow - someone is checking you. Roles are constantly changing. Very quickly, even at the ‚Äúpool‚Äù, people identify ‚Äúknowledge centers‚Äù in certain areas and often turn to them. You can find the answer to each question by googling by asking a question in slack or by asking a neighbor on the right or left. Does this guarantee you will be given the right advice? Of course not, but it will teach one more of the skills that will be useful in work - critical thinking and the ability to find valid information.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/th/nm/yn/thnmynbhnxpuh2hiermso1pbka0.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Those who graduated from FizTech and those who worked as a courier, flight attendant or lawyer yesterday study at School 21. At the same time, a graduate of a mechmath (or mathmachus) is unlikely to come to us to learn the basics of programming, rather, for the experience of teamwork and other softskills that have no place in classical education. Such an alloy of people with different experience, education, age and knowledge is simply not possible at any university and provides invaluable experience and opportunities.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p7/ju/2b/p7ju2b-3xtls2l30gcfelt4xr2q.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my opinion, communication is always important for everyone, even for the most gloomy introverts. Isn't it more valuable to write code, understanding what part of the project it is, how it will be implemented and what it will give people? The School has an atmosphere where everyone can find like-minded people who will suit him in temperament, interest and knowledge. But softskills are not limited only to communication. One of the most important goals is to return responsibility to the participants themselves. You make your own schedule (time management), you form a team yourself (teamwork), you yourself look for a path to new knowledge to complete projects (autonomy), you yourself defend projects (responsibility for the result), you choose when you will your ‚Äúsession‚Äù - before entering the internship you must pass a series of five exams that take place every week (planning),you can redo and retake the exams as much as you need (the right to make a mistake) and so on.</font></font></div>
