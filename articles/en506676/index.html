<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a constantly working fountain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you read “Dune”, then you understand how much it shocked at first the locals with wealth in a country where there is only desert. </font></font></sup> <br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Qatari in 2018 turned out to be the richest people in the world.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We considered the share of GDP per citizen, that is, we can conclude that there are few citizens in the country. More precisely, very few. The fact is that there is a lot of gas and oil on a small autonomous peninsula. And in the shelf near too. Despite the fact that the country is smaller than the Kaliningrad region (and 4 times smaller than the Moscow Region). Since there are only about a quarter of a million Qatari people, it was quite simple to win the title of the richest country in the world. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our board went through orographic cloudiness, and the stewardess said in a gentle voice: "Now it’s a little shocking, so please pray, sitting in a chair." This reminded the second amazing feature of Qatar - perhaps this is the most open Muslim country in terms of tolerance for foreigners. That is, you can fly quietly, without fear of messing up due to the difference in cultures.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But back to the residents and the fact that they found oil. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Imagine the situation: you have a small three-story city, a desert with almost no green areas, a certain number of camels ... and, perhaps, that's all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And suddenly almost endless money is being rolled in to you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You cannot steal, you need to build the best city in the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The exercise is not speculative, just such a task here in all seriousness was solved starting from zero. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Hold for a second and try to list: what would you do and in what order?</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Start</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first signs that Doha will become a modern city appeared around 2006. Then we went along a rather traditional path: we chose a district and began to build it up with expensive skyscrapers in the “construction site of the century”. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/9c/no/cm9cno1h-zkzr9mw4xsvznibjsa.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They were needed primarily for international business and company offices. It should be noted that the oil and gas sector makes 55% of the country's GDP. Agriculture is almost absent; heavy industry is well developed. 90% of food is purchased outside. Water is obtained by desalination of the sea on gas. There is no income tax (the state sells gas, citizens just live), light, water, accommodation and treatment for citizens are in social guarantees.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most of the urban environment is determined by the desert. +25 in the winter, +45 in the summer, and this provided that the shadow comes only from what you yourself build. That is, it feels like +60. Fogs add joy, not just from water, but from fine sand dust. And rain is generally perceived as a holiday, because it happens a couple of times a year. </font></font><br>

<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Old district and new on the horizon. Please note that all the glasses are blacked out, plus here the architecture is separately coordinated for glare, reflections and all kinds of semicircular surfaces that can work with the lens.</font></font></sup><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Because of the wild heat, the main life here is at night, when you can move around without a car. In the morning and evening, business time, and in the afternoon it is better to sit in a house.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/1h/yl/zw1hyljr8nbzp4skvcti27rbn2q.jpeg"><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Actually, the citizens of Qatar do something like this. Those who came here on a shift work work. More precisely, not quite to Doha, but to the next one, as the fixer poetically put it, Benzinsk: </font></font><br>

<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mizalt - dreams come true! In fact, there are many migrants, but the crime rate in Qatar is one of the lowest in the region. I would say, as in Japan, only in Japan they stopped chopping off different parts of the body for theft much earlier. Despite the fact that the indigenous people are only a quarter of a million, the total population of the country is about 2.7 million people.</font></font></sup><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another important feature of Doha is its very active terraforming. Here the islands are washed up and the coastline is increased. This happens without stopping, an important milestone was 400 hectares of land and 30 kilometers of coastline. In the center of the bay, right in front of the city, there is an artificial island Pearl. </font></font><br>

In May 2015, Doha was officially elected as one of the “Seven New Wonder Cities”. </font></font><br>

It is clear that now the city is actively rebuilding, because there is a development plan by 2030. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From here there are a lot of temporary huts, but they look pretty organic: Have you </font></font><br>

In addition to the air-conditioned stadium, it is worth noting a separate campus: when the money came, they first invested in education and technology, and only then they began to pull up the architecture.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oriental features</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
About 80% of the population practice Islam. </font></font><br>

I know that there are quite a few stereotypes regarding the philosophy behind this religion, but I just want to note that almost all the postulates are dictated by ancient science. By the way, almost all modern science owes exactly to achievements from this region itself - we use Arabic numbers, learned Arabic navigation (which launched the era of great geographical discoveries). </font></font><br>

<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only because of reading from right to left, the numbering order will not be very familiar. By the way, Big Brother is watching: if you stumble with a loud sound at the entrance to the elevator, the intercom will come to life and ask: “Is everything all right with you?”</font></font></sup><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Advanced shipping and trade are mathematics, logic and astronomy. A compass, a globe and many precision measuring instruments were in the region long before the advent of analogues in Europe. </font></font><br>

But let's return to medicine for a second. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Restrictions on pork are related to the fact that it was impossible to eat meat, the freshness of which you are not sure. Pork spoiled in the heat too quickly, and therefore, apparently, at some point instead of complicated rules for determining how it was there, there was a decision to exclude it from the diet. Separation of hands is an idea very clear even in a modern pandemic: left for potentially dangerous and dirty objects, right for clean ones. Permanent ablution is also at the core level of religion: try washing your hands and face less often, and you will quickly run into epidemics. I could tell a lot more, but we’d better return to this story when we talk about our regions like Tatarstan. During a pandemic on May 31, the country broke the record for the number of infected in the Arab world. On the one hand - an incredible amount of external contacts (as it should be in such a city),and on the other - then they examined almost everyone personally. They closed for isolation who needed, which then gave a sharp drop in the number of cases.</font></font><br>

<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compare with the Venetian glass. Jewelers in general have historically been a stronghold of science. They partly gave us modern chemistry and at the same time a printing press (thanks to Uncle Gutenberg).</font></font></sup><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
It is important for us that here women can wear their usual European clothes (not shorts, not mini-pants and they will not be allowed in pants, but a medium-length skirt does not offend anyone's feelings, and shoulders should be closed just for the sake of survival). Couples can cuddle on the streets (but kissing is too much, but they still won’t take them to the police). A European can afford shorts on the street (undesirable, but they will understand, plus anyway his legs will quickly burn out). Almost everyone in the center understands English. In a cultural area, you can swim only in completely closed clothes (like a ninja), but in residential areas, even in swimsuits.</font></font><br>

It is interesting that if in our country religion is considered something that it’s strange to climb into technology, then there are no such troubles. Here is the mosque: </font></font><br>

Pay attention to the scoreboard on the wall: it shows the time until the next prayer and the exact schedule for the day. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And what an eastern country without a market! Doha's main attraction is Suk Wakif, where you can buy anything you want. But there are no price tags, and we have to bargain as if not in ourselves. One of our deals lasted three days: I left and returned, walked past the shops in the morning and in the evening, and on the third day the merchant and I already felt that the sale itself was not the main thing. </font></font><br>

<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At night there is a celebration of life, so even if you are only 4 hours in Qatar with a change, it’s worth taking the metro to the market, get off for an hour and return. </font></font></sup><br>

They are treated here with the wildest respect. This is a form of elite entertainment, and the best bird is a sign of great pride. Very often locals, when they found out that I was from Russia, talked about the gyrfalcon that we gave the emir in 2016. And we were ready to discuss his rare gray color, and the fact that he arrived untrained, as expected, and much more. By the way, birds for the summer are often sent to other (cooler) countries, for example, to Azerbaijan. Because in the heat of hell they do not hunt. For such things private jets are needed, any local will tell you this. </font></font><br>

The only thing I could not understand was why stone stairs are often made between two escalators to the surface. In general, if the rotary mechanism breaks down on the escalator, it just gets up and you get the usual staircase. There are problems with the tape (like the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">accident at the 1982 Aviamotornaya</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">when in 2 minutes almost 100 people rolled off the escalator, 8 dead, 30 wounded). But the stairs nearby in this situation will not help. Therefore, the only thing that remains is aesthetic and sporting reasons. As practice has shown, the Japanese and Qatari really run along this staircase. But not often. </font></font><br>

There were buses like our intercity buses to the metro in the city: with air conditioning and separate seats. They still go, but the metro solves almost all the issues. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now aviation.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now Qatar Airlines has a network of 160 countries and more than a thousand destination airports, five stars on Skyrax (safety and convenience - that is, in the top 7 companies in the world). The best airline in the world was 5 times: 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2019. It all started with a small private airline, and for a couple of years continued simply as a transportation business. Something like the model "bought the planes a bucket and slowly beat off." Well, slowly - this is because the plane generally does not quickly pay off, but by the standards of aviation, things went quickly, of course. But all the same, the next more or less major step would be about ten years after the start with this kind of operations. But at about the same time that the state created a tax climate for foreign companies, the airlines decided to make national pride. They consolidated shares in the state, issued investments,set an experienced person (which is typical, with a pilot’s license), quickly began to build up the fleet. At first it was quite a lot of used aircraft, which made it possible to become the fastest growing airline in the world. For some time they were unprofitable, but then it became clear why. As soon as the financial model settled down, the aircraft began to change for new ones. The first A350 was taken by the Qatari, by the way. We have entered into a huge network of partnerships, right down to connected transfers with German railways.The first A350 was taken by the Qatari, by the way.

Before the epidemic, the situation arose that Qatar was, as it were, in the center of the world between six continents, and with its very small area it still provides huge traffic. Almost all of these 29 million people a year go through the Doha airport (which, by the way, was also once a part of the bay, and then it was filled up to the required size). And here the great Qatari PR is connected. The fact is that part of the oil revenues here was allowed for information. You can read the full story Wiki article about </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Al Jazeera</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, but it’s important for us that they are able to work with information, and that such PR is also well understood. The first applied aspect - with transfers from 4 hours, free tours of Doha, a free five-star hotel at the airport and a lot of all kinds of entertainment, including a huge pool, are offered here. Yes, also at the airport. By the way, the airport has its own railway (monorail), because something has become very healthy. </font></font><br>

Well, to finish about the local transport is, of course, boats. It is on them that one can see how beautifully everything here combines the most modern with the spirit of archaism. On the one hand, high-tech areas and unmanned vehicles, and on the other - if it looks like in the good old days, then this is also a plus.</font></font><br>

<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here you can take a walk along this bay in one of the proposed excursions from the transplant: you will be taken to the bus according to the cool procedure WITHOUT passing passport control, put in a boat, rolled, put back into the clean area of ​​the airport. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, as if the bus and boat are still part of the clean zone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can go out like this, a transit visa is not a question at all, and there are almost no queues. </font></font></sup><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And here are the boats: </font></font><br>

To understand the love of archaic, look at the evacuation plan style: </font></font><br>

Here you just have your own visual language, which is largely based on desert traditions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Desert itself</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most of Qatar looks like this: </font></font><br>
 <br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here before, everything was without exception, and life was only on a thin coastal strip. But the terraforming and construction of Doha made part of the country cool and shady. Inside the buildings. Shopping centers have become instead of parks: these are the only large walking spots where the right microclimate is created under a huge dome. By the way, this is inside one of the shopping centers similar to our Mega: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/5t/3a/tw5t3aj9rcfwxwbavh94t37yf4a.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, it’s still important to touch on a couple of aspects of architecture. Firstly, huge budgets are spent on it. But I remind you, in Qatar, almost all the questions in the spirit: “How do you see your future project?” may be allowed to answer “Yes”. Here is another illustration:</font></font><br>
 <br>

<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This decor element is made of Murano glass. One such thing costs several million rubles (this is my estimate from the knowledge of the cost of the master’s work time and an approximate estimate of man hours and wholesale prices). Please note the entire district street in them.</font></font></sup><br>
 <br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nf/23/zt/nf23zt0tjarjqjahlzfmndvncxu.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
But much more often here the emphasis is not on expensive materials, but on an expensive idea and embodiment. Game designer Tynan Sylvester once spoke about the construction style at Rimworld - they say that at first everyone loves to build cozy rectangular houses, and only then they start to make really strange curvilinear shapes. Well, in general, the stage of square houses here passed almost immediately: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/qw/fw/cxqwfw0tegikk7hc42urwrazilm.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Inside buildings, it can also be very interesting:</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And next to this wildest chic there is a place where you can relax from civilization. To take and go to the desert is a rather expensive pleasure. From our point of view, this is a campground in the middle of the sands, where the richest people come and enjoy for some reason. The first sensation is as if sandwiches were served in luxury restaurants. But if you start to understand - the desert here is very important both as a source of entertainment, and as a place to relax from all the fuss. </font></font><br>

<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can rent a piece of sand and build a miniature Martian base there - a camp that will be yours. Such camps are still renting out for several days as camp sites with us. A similar base is in Kalmykia in the reserve </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on the cordon</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font></sup><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ve/dh/oh/vedhohepppj4b3i1rnyyung4tjo.jpeg"><br>
<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything you need: toilet with a tank, generator, water supplies, shower.</font></font></sup><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Tourists who have chosen the “desert adventure” at the airport bring camels to take a selfie: </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, of course, the real joy is that you can lower the tires and drive along the dunes. Qualification is needed very special, because your favorite pastime is to go sideways almost to the level of falling diagonally like this: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/nz/ex/ssnzexhhxifsjajpusjnongntpy.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes, of course, you have to get a shovel: </font></font><br>
<br>

 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ah! There are </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sledges</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the cars </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Special desert sleds, where you can perfectly slide off the dune. This, of course, is worth doing in the evening, because climbing a dune on foot in the afternoon is not the best adventure in the world. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the exit of the desert site, the tires are again inflated:</font></font><br>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_r/ep/zo/_repzodfue0feurenocsuniqgmm.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And if you go around all these cars, you can see how people spend the night. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They have a bonfire and a kettle there to make amazing tea with condensed milk. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In unhurried conversations around the fire - the most joy: </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, you can get directly to the border with the Emirates, which runs through the water. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Across the coast, another country is visible.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Transplant or stopover?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Doha has literally been a transit city. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The city is being completed, overgrown with a bunch of interesting things, its own events appear like art festivals, the number of entertainment for tourists is increasing. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dz/23/nk/dz23nkfjsig-mc5pj6m4jnqfrby.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You can go all over the country in a day, and it’s worth it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, if you fly by (and there are all chances), try to take a stopover for a couple of days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nakosyachit here is very difficult (unlike other countries with a very different culture from our), and you can see a lot of interesting things. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, it’s just worth taking a look at how all of this came out of the desert with a small settlement over the years.</font></font></div>
