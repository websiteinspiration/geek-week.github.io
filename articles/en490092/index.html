<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1991, the Enlightenment publishing house published a children's book, The Encyclopedia of Professor Fortran. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost instantly, she became a bestseller and sold millions of copies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was a very easy and understandable story about personal computers, which practically no one had in our country. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The DataArt museum project talked with the authors of the book, Andrei Zaretsky and Alexander Trukhanov, about how two physicists decided to become writers and came up with professors Fortran and Kadabra. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first part of the monologue - the birth of an idea, a hated scientific study, freedom of thought in Chernogolovka and tea drinking with the Polisario Liberation Front.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Physicists</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> First, Sasha and I wrote a book, “I was in the computer city,” where her hero, boy Alyosha, after various events received the “Encyclopedia of Professor Fortran”. But most of the Russian children of that time, who later became both programmers and scientists, remembered this red “Encyclopedia” more. There was a U-turn - absolutely brilliant at the time - when the book in the middle opened, and turned into a personal computer. So many people admitted that this was their first real computer. We owe it to Sasha by the invention of it, all the rest I came up with, haha. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The very spread of the "Encyclopedia of Professor Fortran" </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With Andrei, we worked together in the laboratory of ice physics in Chernogolovka, at the Institute of Solid State Physics. I was engaged in the automation of physical experiments there. Automated everything except boiling the kettle. Prior to that, he received a diploma in physical engineering and graduated from MEPhI, faculty of theoretical experimental physics. Then computers appeared, and we began to use them in work. At some point, the idea arose to write a book about them. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/m2/es/elm2eskp2exzpwhbl2qnwn-fiae.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Institute of Solid State Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences was founded on February 15, 1963. </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.Z .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I studied at the Physics Institute in Dolgoprudny, faculty of general and applied physics. Entered in 1970, graduated in 76th. I came to the Institute of Solid State Physics in Chernogolovka for the first time in 1971 as a freshman - in the summer I asked for practice. He was a scientist, defended a candidate.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I first encountered computers during my training. At Fiztekh we were allotted some time for the machine room. They came with their punch cards, wrote some programs. Then, when I began to work, the Mera computer appeared in the laboratory, such a healthy cabinet. Then Sasha and I met. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AT:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I wrote an automation program, then the modules for controlling external devices first appeared. That is, the computer is not in itself, but with some input and output interfaces, so that sensors can be connected. And this was considered an incredible progress. We drove a book into this computer. In a sense, they used the potential of the institute for personal gain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AZ </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I believe that we gave the country no less than an institute! </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, we thought that this book was simply necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was a feeling that everyone wants a computer, and practically no one has it. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AZ:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It is important that we did not teach programming. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, we told that there is another life, and programming is just a working tool for creating this life.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Earring, swearing computer and Nobel laureate</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Here are a few facts so that you have an idea about that time and about what we were then. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perestroika began; Andrei trained in England. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He returned to the laboratory, which was personally supervised by academician Osipyan, with an earring in his ear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For others it was a shock. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems like free morals, free, but not quite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then Andrei came up with the version that this is acupuncture ... </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, I didn’t invent it. When I conducted seminars at the physics and technology department, senior colleagues approached me and asked: “Andrey, what is this?” “Well, that's cool.” “Can we all say that this is from a medical point of view?” I say: "Yes, I do not care at all what you say." And then they spread the information that comrade Zaretsky had medical problems, and this is a very important way of treatment. Everyone pretended that it was valid for health. It was the 89th year. Our first book was published in the 90th, but we have already written everything. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The production cycle was then longer than now. From England I brought a lot of different children's books, the expanded "Encyclopedia of Professor Fortran" is made including on their basis. Whatever you say, then in England there were much more different interesting decisions. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They had computers, unlike us. Our computers were used only for scientific purposes. And even then it was necessary to order a change on the computer to knock on the keys. Entertainment and toys on computers as such were not then. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AZ:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How was it not? The bombs were falling. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/im/bf/1v/imbf1vqlns0m50j9l_3i40vxzug.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Option Space Invaders in pseudographics for SM-4 </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The bombs were falling, yes. The game "Save the earth from some kind of seven-seater of danger" with a fairly primitive text monochrome graphics. When the “Mackintosh” appeared in Polish with sound, the first thing they did at the institute was to teach them to swear. Especially in another laboratory, which received the whole thing, they invited someone: "Come in, have some tea." Then everyone suddenly came out, except for the guest, the computer said something obscene, and the person did not understand what was happening. But the computer spoke with a Polish accent, so swindlers quickly figured out.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There, along the corridor, the current Nobel Prize winner Andrei Geim walked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A pensive man with shabby elbows on his jacket. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thinking about something and smoking all the time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I asked my colleagues what people were doing there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They answered me with diamonds: “The industrial application is not very interesting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are engaged in science. ”</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Scientificpop</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrey Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All, without exception, non-fiction books of that time were written on the same principle. Some professor, or dad, together with a boy or girl, go somewhere, see some bush, and then a scientific conversation begins - about the kidneys, about leaves, etc. A portion of science ends and the "adventures" continue on. We madly did not like this standard scientific move, and an idea came which we did not see anywhere else. History unfolds on its own, some events replace others. But that same encyclopedia is a separate book. Do you want to read. There are links. You can read a book without looking at them, but you can look. We have given the freedom to make decisions. But in science there is no freedom. You have to read smart daddies or professorial stories, and then continue on. Of course, we are proud of this discovery.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/zc/aa/ohzcaa7tstkey3sya5fivokhxbs.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But first, we began to write as it was customary. That is, that same fairy tale and an explanation right there. Fortran arose later when an understanding of a separate encyclopedia appeared. We started with a fairy tale about Alyosha. The words “display”, “mouse” and so on appeared in it. Either dad or someone else explained it. Professor Fortran had no idea. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We very quickly realized that it was boring, disgusting. At the same time, they read books of this type, and all of them left an unpleasant impression. Then the idea of ​​an encyclopedia was born. Fortran appeared as an explainer and his team. And it’s fortunate that nobody saw the first versions of the book, except for us and our editor. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Probably the most famous decent meme with Professor Fortran, </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I saw the head of the laboratory. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He somehow came to us, and we started printing - the pages began to creep out of the printer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After some time, I had to change jobs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The boss realized that I have a lot of free time and he himself suggested a place where they pay more and where it will be more interesting to me.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Disco Chernogolovka</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I think our book was born, including freedom of thought in Chernogolovka. A specific town, some kind of non-burden was present there at all. Sasha and I in the seventies in a youth club held discos. They even wanted to kick us out of the Komsomol several times for some statements. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Disco consisted of two parts. The first is an educational, collective listening to a group, an album, then you can discuss. Next up is dancing. I was more an organizer, other guys were involved in music. Our task was to create an atmosphere, start the process.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since it was an alien Western culture, everything had to be stigmatized. I remember our first program - they represented the unknown Italian rock opera Felona and Sorona to anyone. Naturally, in the beginning we talked about "the difficult life of Italian workers." They branded the enemy, then they listened. To know the enemy in person. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov: There was an</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> amazing level at our discos. Kagebeshniki periodically appeared. We watched what kind of music we would use. They listened. Could ask where you got this record. Where did you buy it? Maybe you are a smuggler? Usually in such cases it was said that an uncle, aunt or a friend for a scientific exchange traveled to Europe and brought it. Somehow it was possible to explain, at least, they did not immediately press against the wall. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.Z .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The equipment was partially bought with some kind of state money, they did something themselves. Light music, for example. All the first turntables in general were mine and the first records. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I remember there was a disco where Andrey arranged a casino with cockroach races. According to the book "Running". The White Guard lifestyle was criticized and stigmatized, but the excitement rose eerie. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cockroach races in the film "Running" 1970 </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.Z .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our youth club had many different rooms. Traditionally, everything was held in one room, and we created a situation where something happens in each room. And at the same time. There are cockroaches, there is an auction, something else. And people were bursting. They wanted to go there, and there, and there, everything was seething, there was a feeling of a fantastic holiday ... It is clear that we did not do this together or even the five of us. They created a skeleton of this story with friends, and people picked it up. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t2/26/n0/t226n00gum3p5bcrmlqohv0tvlu.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Almost the top is one of the first breakdance festivals. We organized accommodation in a boarding house, and people from all over the Soviet Union arrived. There were special groups that ensured order. Someone was involved in transport. We were able to do this ourselves, without financial and organizational assistance from the state. All the same, normal people. Give us freedom - we will do everything.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> But then the question arose, are we bad or good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost all the time he arose. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only with one figured out, the second roll out, the third. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So it’s good that there were no complaints about the book.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Troubled youth</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Trukhanov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Once we were invited to a festival of youth and students. This is the 85th year. The event was held in a private club, and illegal immigrants arrived there. The Liberation Front of South Sahara (Polisario) is just militants from the revolution by today's standards. There was an armored personnel carrier with special forces in case we were taken hostage. I talked with the KGB agent. I say: "It is not clear how they are going to build socialism with a knife in their sleeves." “We ourselves have not yet decided on their account. You are careful, ”he replies. According to him, many arrived on foreign passports through third countries and under other surnames. There were Kurds. Such cool guys - from a machine gun just now. So we talked with them. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrey Zaretsky:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a festival, youth, albeit problematic. At that time there were not many people who were engaged in youth culture. Many did not understand how it should be. People were recruited from everywhere who had anything to do with it. They said: “We guys are you before this atatushka, and now the Motherland needs you.” </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No one understood what a disc jockey is, what it should be. Us in the club, where they shot "What?" Where? When? ”, They gathered for a day or two and read acting classes, something else, and gave a lecture on the psychology of the crowd. They prepared for any non-standard situation, but there were no standard situations then. Thank God, everything worked out, but there were fights on Red Square between delegations, and stabbing between the Polisario Liberation Front and Moroccans. They fought, called each other rapists and murderers. I was shown a film as a very confidant. The guys from Polisario robbed someone of the filming and film technique, and they turned us a film of our own production. The plot is this: several jeeps are driving up in a small town in Africa - rubbing, rubbing from bazookas to their homes. There is fire, smoke. Then they stop the film and say: “Well, we’re the worst of you,we won’t show how the people liquidate the bourgeois. ”</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They had manuals, such books, where our whole world was explained in 5-10 sentences. These are bad - they need to be cut. These are good - they need help. I asked: “Guys, how does your country live if you have nothing but some tomato plantation there?” “Well, you know, we’ll capture the tank - we’ll sell it,” they say. “But you cannot control a tank.” - "Never mind. We have a customer. People fly in from him, take the tank and take it somewhere. ” Once the reconnaissance and warning aircraft sold. He sat down accidentally, he was right there to grab. Some Westerners came with their pilots, gave money and took the plane ... </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.T .:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the festival collapsed and these guys left, we drank some of their loose tea. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone was afraid that the tea is not simple, wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They claimed: "This is ordinary tea, just grown here." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then they disassembled and carried out their exposition from self-woven carpets, wooden mock-ups of knives and machine guns, drowned for socialism, got tired, sat down and fell asleep. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They sleep, and their fingers twitch - they shoot in a dream. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AZ:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> This is the contingent with which we then worked.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Coffee instead of cars</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A.Z:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> If not for perestroika, Sasha and I would be the coolest children's writers in the Soviet Union and in the entire social camp. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because we have already agreed on a real continuation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The following books are about robots, about mathematics, about physics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All in the same vein. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was already a conversation about reprinting in the languages ​​of the republics of the USSR and in Czech ... </font></font><br>
