After much thought about what to write my first post on Habr√©, I stopped at school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The school occupies a significant part of our life, if only because most of our childhood and the childhood of our children and grandchildren pass through it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'm about the so-called high school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although much of what I will write about can be applied to any centrally-managed social sphere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are so many personal experiences and thoughts on this subject that, I think, this will be a series of articles ‚Äúabout school‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today I‚Äôll talk about school ratings and grades, and what‚Äôs wrong with them.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What schools are there and why do they need ratings</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Any good parent dreams of giving their children the best education possible. It is believed that this is ensured by the "quality" of the school. Of course, that few class of wealthy people who put drivers with bodyguards to their children considers the school level to be a matter of their own prestige and status. But all the rest of the population strives to choose the best school for their children within their capabilities. Naturally, if the school is the only one within reach, then the question of choice is not worth it. Another thing if you live in a large city.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even in Soviet times, in that center of not the largest province where I spent most of my school years, there was already a choice, and there was competition. Schools competed with other schools for the most, as they would say now, ‚Äúauthoritative‚Äù parents. Parents virtually pushed their elbows for the "best" school. I was lucky: my school was always unofficially listed among the top three (out of almost a hundred) in the city. True, the housing market and school buses, in their modern sense, did not exist. My road to school and back - in a combined march: on foot and by public transport with transfers - took on average an incredible 40 minutes in each direction. But it was worth it, because I was in the same class as the grandson of a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU ...</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What can we say about our time, when not only the apartment can be changed for a better life for posterity, but also the country. As the theoreticians of Marxism predicted, the degree of </font></font><s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">class contradictions in</font></font></s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> competition for resources in capitalist society continues to increase. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another question: what is the criterion of this very ‚Äúquality‚Äù of the school? This concept has many facets. Some of them are purely material in nature.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Nearly the city center, excellent transport accessibility, nice modern building, comfortable lobby, spacious recreations, bright classes, a huge assembly hall, a full-fledged sports hall with separate changing rooms, showers and toilets for boys and girls, all kinds of outdoor areas for sports and creativity, 25- meter-long shooting gallery in the basement and even your school garden with fruit trees and vegetable beds, all this is buried in flower beds and greenery. It was not a retelling of the fantastic projects of our educational officials, but a description of my Soviet school. I am writing this not to evoke unkind feelings towards me. Just now, from the height of my years, I understand that the rumors on which the then unofficial rating of the city‚Äôs schools was based had a very solid and clear base.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this, of course, is not the limit of the security that some schools can boast in Russia now. Pools, tennis courts, croquet and mini-golf courses, restaurant meals, horseback riding lessons and full board - any whim for your money (if the school is private), and sometimes for budget ones (if the school is departmental). Of course, not for everyone, of course, there is competition too. But now it is not for some abstract resource of attention and exaltation there, as in the USSR, but, directly, for money.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But in my childhood, few of us paid at least some attention to all this. Without any arrogance, we ran to friends at their schools, absolutely not noticing either the lack of an adequate gym, or any decent school grounds for holding rulers. Also, our less fortunate (in terms of the prosperity of their schools) girlfriends, getting on occasion to our school, were surprised at her unusual chicness only for the first time and only for a moment: well, walls and walls, platforms and platforms, You think, at school, this is not at all the main thing. And that is true.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All this ‚Äúexpensive-rich‚Äù would not have cost anything if there had not been a highly professional teaching staff in my school. Each success and each failure has its own reasons. I do not exclude that the reasons why my school had a high level of teaching correlate with the reasons why she had the described material and technical security. There was a teacher distribution system in the USSR, and this system obviously distributed the best teachers to the best schools. Despite the fact that the teachers of our school did not get the slightest advantage over other teachers in the city in terms of salaries, they were nevertheless in a privileged position: at least, their professional circle of contacts and working conditions were better than others. Perhaps there were some incentives for ‚Äúgreyhound puppies‚Äù (apartments, vouchers, etc.), but I really doubtthat they went down below the level of the head teacher.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In modern Russia, there is practically no system for distributing teachers among schools. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything is left to the market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To the competition of schools for parents and parents for schools was added the competition of teachers for work and the competition of schools for good teachers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, the latter were outsourced to headhunters. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The free market has opened a niche of information support for competition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It simply had to appear school ratings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And they appeared. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One example of such ratings can be found </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How ratings are considered and what it means</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The rating methodology in Russia did not become original, and, in general, repeated the approaches of foreign countries. In short, it is believed that the main purpose of obtaining school education is to continue education in a higher educational institution. Accordingly, the rating of the school is the higher, the more its graduates go to universities, which also have their own level of "prestige", which affects the rating of the school.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The fact that someone might dream of getting just a good secondary education is not even considered. Indeed, what difference should you have as this or that school teaches, if you are not aimed at taking the highest level? And how, in general, can a rural school be good in which not a single student is studying, whose family would be able to afford the child's higher education? In other words, they show us that they are ready to spend efforts only on the best. If you are an element of society with a layer ‚Äúlower than high‚Äù, then they will not help you ‚Äúemerge‚Äù. There they have their own competition, why do they need a new one?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, an absolute minority of schools are listed in published Russian private ratings. State ranking of schools in Russia, as in the USSR, if any, is definitely not in the public domain. The entire public assessment of the quality of schools by the state was expressed in the "awarding" of the honorary titles of "lyceum" or "gymnasium". The situation in which each Russian school will have its own public place in the ranking seems so far fantastic. I suspect that officials from education are sweating cold at the mere thought of the possibility of publishing such a thing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The methods for calculating available ratings usually do not even take into account the proportion of graduates who have entered a university, but simply their absolute number. Thus, a small school, no matter how good it is, is unlikely to be ahead of the school, which is three times more, even if the first one has a 100% share and the second only 50% (ceteris paribus) . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone knows that the vast majority of admission to universities is now based on the final exam score. Moreover, loud scandals with fraud during the exam, when an abnormally high academic performance was noted in whole regions of the Russian Federation, are still fresh. Against this background, such a rating, obtained essentially for a combination of the Unified State Examination and the financial solvency of the inhabitants of a particular territory, without taking into account, at least, the fact that graduates of schools successfully completed the university is not enough.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another drawback of the available ratings is the lack of taking into account the effect of the ‚Äúhigh base‚Äù. This is when a popular school is so demanding on candidates for admission to its lists that a large number of graduates who have arrived turn into something for granted. Thus, the school owes its rating to talented students rather than talented teachers. And this is also not quite what we expect from an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù rating.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Speaking of teachers: very often we do not notice trees outside the forest. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">School rating is, in fact, such a surrogate for teacher rating. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Teachers are so important to us at school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes, with the departure of a single teacher, a school may lose all its dominant position in a particular subject. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it makes sense to personify the ratings of schools, turning them into teacher ratings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, education officials and school management (like other employers) are absolutely not interested in enhancing the role of a simple teacher in society (like other lower-level employees). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this does not mean at all that society itself is not interested in this.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About teaching, pedagogy and professional ethics of teachers</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In later Soviet times, there was a standard set of universities that were required to be in any provincial city. There were a lot of specialists in the national economy. There was even a popular proverb that briefly and clearly formulated the stratification of higher Soviet education: "No mind - go to Honey, no money - go to Ped, and (if) neither one nor the other - to the Polytechnic." The peasantry in the late Soviet times was probably considered to have been largely defeated, therefore the proverb did not even mention Selkhoz, which often existed along with those listed. As can be seen from this folklore work, training in the provincial Pedagogical Universities was the traditional destiny of not rich, but thinking youth.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Such universities themselves (‚Äúpedagogical‚Äù by name) graduated teachers, and now, for the most part, teachers. I have long noticed that with the departure of the past Soviet era, the word "teacher" began to disappear from the school vocabulary until its complete disappearance. This is probably due to its ancient origin. To be a ‚Äúslave for the protection and education of children‚Äù in the Soviet society of ‚Äúvictorious slaves‚Äù was not at all shameful, but, as it were, honorable. In a society of bourgeois ideals, no one even wants to associate with a slave.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The language cannot be called a teacher of a university professor, because it is understood that his student is an adult and a person who wants to study, who has decided on his priorities. Such teachers usually receive more school teachers from us, therefore this position is often the goal of professional growth. Well, how will you be hired at a university if you are a teacher? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Meanwhile, the school needs teachers. A little benefit from the (pre) server, when no one wants or cannot for some reason ‚Äútake‚Äù the served. The teacher (from the Greek </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"leading child"</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ) is not just a person who has knowledge of the subject or owns teaching methods. This is a specialist for working with children. The main task of the teacher is to interest.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A real teacher will never scream or be offended by a child, will not weave his personal relationships with parents into the educational process, and will not exert psychological pressure. A true teacher does not blame children for laziness, he is looking for approaches to them. A good teacher is not scary for children; he is interested in them. But how can we demand, or even ask, for teachers to be interesting to our children, if these teachers themselves are completely not interesting to us? We, as a society, ourselves are to blame for the extinction of teachers, we do little to save them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Real teachers are most interested in the ranking of teachers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's like a Red Book for endangered species. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to take into account each, then to cherish and cherish, to adopt the secrets of the profession. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs also important to identify and show the world ‚Äúteachers‚Äù who do not bother pedagogy, so that people know not only their heroes, but also their antipodes, and not confuse the former with the latter.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What other schools are there, and a little about grades</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Whether long or short, but everything in life is changing. So, for family reasons, I suddenly changed the "elite" provincial school, to the usual capital. We can say that again (like that anecdotal collective farmer who accidentally arrived in the city and became a currency prostitute) I was ‚Äúlucky." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Less than a year was left before leaving school. It was not enough for parents to look for a ‚Äúdecent‚Äù school in a new city for themselves. I was recorded in the first one. To be honest, I was pretty slobbery and quite used to my average score, fluctuating around the four (often from the bottom). But then suddenly I found myself a child prodigy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This was the height of the Gorbachev "perestroika". Perhaps the presence in the capital of VCRs and cassettes with Hollywood films through the "corrupting influence of the West" completely disintegrated the Soviet system, or maybe in the "second-class" metropolitan schools it always has been, I will never know the reason. But the level of knowledge of my new classmates lagged behind mine (rather mediocre by the standards of my previous school), on average, by two years.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And it cannot be said that all the teachers were also ‚Äúsecond-rate‚Äù, but their eyes were somehow extinct. They are used to the amorphousness of students and the indifference of school leadership. Suddenly appearing in their ‚Äúswamp‚Äù, I immediately became a sensation. After the first quarter, it became clear that at the end of the year I will have all fives, except for the only four for the Russian language, which were not taught at that time in graduation classes. The headmistress, when meeting with her parents, earnestly apologized that I would not have the silver medal put to me, because ‚ÄúI had to order it in GORONO back in July,‚Äù and by then there could be no hope of worthy students from the school.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, it cannot be said that the average mark in the new school was extremely low. Probably, for such a GORONO also did not favor. At that time, I understood the grading system that was practiced in my class this way: I listened to ‚Äúfive‚Äù in the lesson, came to the lesson ‚Äúfour,‚Äù and did not come to ‚Äúthree.‚Äù Oddly enough, there were a majority of threes in my new class.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I, who had never been a student in my life, only at this school I found with horror that it was considered normal for some students to come to an educational institution in the middle of the third lesson and leave before the fifth. Of the 35 people who were in the class, usually no more than 15 were present at the lessons. Moreover, their composition usually changed during the course of the day. I won‚Äôt go into the details of regular use by more than half of the class of completely non-children's ‚Äústress relievers‚Äù. To complete the picture, I can only say that two of my classmates themselves became mothers that year.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After that, many times in my life I came across different schools where my children and the children of my friends studied. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I can safely say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to my graduation class. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, I did not get any knowledge of the school curriculum there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the experience gained enormous. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There they showed me an absolute ‚Äúbottom‚Äù; I have never seen a lower level of attitude towards studies since then. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I hope you will forgive me for such a lengthy narrative of my private experience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All that I wanted to prove with this: grades are not always an indicator of the quality of education.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Grades vs grades, and what's wrong with them</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Above, I have already paid attention to how changes in language reflect a transformation in the consciousness of society, and, in particular, of its teaching part. Here is another such example. Recall how the unforgettable </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Agnia Lvovna</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> writes about her brother‚Äôs habits: ‚ÄúI will recognize Volodina‚Äôs marks without a diary.‚Äù How long have you heard the word ‚Äúmark‚Äù in the context of academic performance? Do you know why?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since the introduction of ubiquitous schooling, teachers have always noted student success in journals. And this notorious record was called before - the ‚Äúmark‚Äù. My grandparents also just called these tsiferki. Just at the time when they were in school, the memory of the people about slavery was fresh enough. Not about ancient Greek slavery (that is where the "teacher" comes from), but about our very own, - Russian. Still alive were many born serfs. That is why ‚Äúevaluating‚Äù a person, that is, literally, assigning a ‚Äúprice‚Äù to him as a product, was considered inappropriate and caused unkind associations. So there were no ‚Äúratings‚Äù then. However, times have changed, and ‚Äúgrades‚Äù replaced the ‚Äúgrades‚Äù even before the ‚Äúteacher‚Äù replaced the ‚Äúteacher‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now you can more fully appreciate the mental transformation of teachers that I am talking about. If you cruelly dissect it to the psychoanalytic extreme, then it looks like a simple and understandable manifesto: ‚ÄúWe are not slave </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">teachers</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , whether you want to or not, take what we </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">teach</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . "We don‚Äôt just want to </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">celebrate the</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> successes of others, we </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">value</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> these others, set the price ourselves." Of course, this manifesto has never been formulated explicitly by anyone. This is the secret fruit of the ‚Äúcollective unconscious‚Äù, which only reflects the reflections of the complex of many years of professional undervaluation of a school teacher in the Soviet-Russian economy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Anyway. Leave psychoanalysis. And let us return from observing mental transformations to practical kinks on the ground. No matter how the marks are called now, let us try to soberly see what is essentially wrong with them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Grades can be relative to highlight a student in one direction or another in front of classmates for educational purposes. They can be pretentious, through them a personal attitude to the student or his family can be expressed. With their help, they can solve the school‚Äôs task of staying in the conditional framework of statistics, lowered ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù for political purposes. Assessments, in the form in which we have them in school magazines now, are always subjective. The most odious manifestations of bias also occur when the teacher deliberately underestimates the grade in order to hint to parents the need for additional payment for their services.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I also knew one teacher who drew marks in the magazine marks (as in the Japanese crossword puzzle). And this, perhaps, was the most ‚Äúinnovative and creative‚Äù application of them that I have ever seen. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you look at the root of the problems with assessments, you can notice their principal source: conflict of interests. After all, the results of teacher‚Äôs work (namely, teachers and students consume teacher‚Äôs labor in schools) are evaluated by the teacher himself. It is as if the services of the cook, in addition to the preparation of the dishes themselves, also meant an assessment of the eaters for how well they ate the served food, and a positive assessment would serve as a criterion for admission to the dessert. There is something strange about this, agree.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, the test system of the exam and the exam in many ways eliminates the disadvantages I have listed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can say that this is a serious step towards the formation of fair learning outcomes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, state examinations do not replace current grades: when you find out about the result, it is usually too late to do anything with the process leading to it.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How do we </font></font><s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">reorganize Rabkrin to</font></font></s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> improve the grading system and form a rating system in education</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Is there a solution that could cut the whole designated ‚ÄúGordian knot‚Äù of problems with ratings and ratings? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in this, more than ever, information technology should help. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To begin with, I will summarize the problems briefly:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Grades biased evaluate student success.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Grades do not evaluate the work of the teacher at all.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Teacher ratings are absent or not public.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">School public ratings do not cover all schools.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">School ratings are methodologically imperfect.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What to do? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First you need to create a system of educational information exchange. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am more than sure that its semblance already exists somewhere in the bowels of the Ministry of Education, RosobrNadzor or somewhere else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, it is not more complicated than many tax, financial, statistical, registry and other information systems successfully deployed in the country - it is possible to recreate it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our state is constantly trying to find out everything about everyone, so let it at least find out for the benefit of society. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As always in working with information, the main thing is accounting and control. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What should this system take into account? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will also list it:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All cash teachers.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All cash students.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All the facts of performance checks and their results, sorted by dates, topics, subjects, students, teachers, assessors, schools, etc.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How to control? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The control principle here is very simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to separate the training and checking training results and not allow to distort measurements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order for the estimates to exclude distortions, subjectivity and randomness it is necessary:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Randomize the time and content of checks.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Personalize student assignments.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anonymize everyone in front of everyone.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Check assignments by many appraisers to get a consensus assessment. </font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Who should become appraisers? Yes, they are the same teachers, they only have to check not those who are taught, but the abstract works of foreign students, who for them are ‚Äúno one should call,‚Äù like their teachers. Of course, it will be possible to evaluate the appraiser. If his grades are systematically significantly different from the average grades of his colleagues, then the system should notice this, tell him and lower his remuneration for the grading process (whatever that means).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What should be the tasks? The task defines the limits of measurements, like a thermometer. You will not be able to find out the exact value of the quantity if the measurements are ‚Äúoff scale‚Äù. Therefore, the tasks should initially be "impossible to complete." It should not scare anyone if the student has completed the work only 50% or 70%. It is scary when the student completed the work 100%. This means the task is bad and does not allow you to accurately measure the limits of knowledge and abilities of the student. Therefore, the volume and complexity of tasks should be prepared with a sufficient margin.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose that there are two sets of students taught by different teachers in a certain subject. For the same time, both sets learned as a result of a conditional average of 90%. How to determine who taught harder? To do this, you need to know the initial level of students. One teacher had smart and trained children, with an initial knowledge of 80%, and the second was not lucky, his students did not know almost anything - 5% with a control measurement. Now it‚Äôs clear which of the teachers did a great job.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, the checks should cover areas not only covered or current topics, but also absolutely not studied. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the only way to see the result of the teacher‚Äôs work, and not the selection of candidates when enrolling in an educational institution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let the teacher not find the key to a particular student, this happens, it doesn‚Äôt matter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if the average progress of tens and hundreds of his students ‚Äúfalls through‚Äù against the background of the average, then this is a signal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maybe it‚Äôs time for such a specialist to go ‚Äúteach‚Äù at a university, or else to hell? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main functions of the system are emerging:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Appointment of tests of knowledge and skills of students.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Definition of random reviewers.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Formation of personal verification tasks.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Transfer of assignments to students and performance results to evaluators.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deliver assessment results to interested parties.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Drawing up actual public ratings of teachers, schools, regions, etc.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The implementation of such a system should ensure greater purity and fairness of competition, give guidance to the education market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And any competition works for the consumer, that is, ultimately, for all of us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this is only a concept so far, and all this is easier to come up with than to implement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But what about the concept itself?</font></font></div>
