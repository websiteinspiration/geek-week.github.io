<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Freeman Dyson at the Advanced Research Institute in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1972. He gained public acclaim as a writer and technology seer.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Freeman John Dyson, a mathematical genius who left his mark on subatomic physics before addressing less ordered things, in particular the Earth’s environmental future and the moral aspects of war, left us on February 28 in a hospital near Princeton, New Jersey. He was 96 years old. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
His daughter, Mia Dyson, confirmed the death. His son George said that three days earlier, Dyson had fallen in a cafe at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies, "which has been his scientific home for over 60 years," as the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">press release</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> wrote </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a young graduate student at Cornell University in 1949, Dyson wrote a landmark work - some of his colleagues even considered it worthy of the Nobel Prize - a deeper understanding of the interaction of light with matter, which leads to the emergence of the world we perceive. The theory promoted by this work, which was then called quantum electrodynamics (QED), is considered one of the greatest achievements of modern science. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, he earned public recognition as a writer and technology visionary. He imagined the study of the solar system with the help of spaceships driven by nuclear explosions, and the foundation of distant colonies that feed on genetically modified plants.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Life begins at age 55 - at this age I published my first book,” he wrote in his book “From Eros to Gaia,” one of those that he created as a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Studies - an impressive post for a person without doctoral degree. The absence of this degree was his pride, he said. Because of his huge collection of honorary degrees and membership in the Royal Scientific Community, people still called him "Dr. Dyson." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dyson called himself a scientific heretic and warned of the need not to confuse mathematical abstractions with the true truth. Although his early work on QED helped put photons and electrons on a consistent theoretical platform, Dyson doubted that superstrings, or anything else, would lead scientists to </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Theory of Everything</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">uniting all physics with a concise formula that fits on a T-shirt. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a 2000 speech he delivered at the Templeton Prize for his success in research or discovery in spiritual life, Dyson quoted </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Francis Bacon as</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> saying: “God forbid that we give out a dream of our imagination as a model of the world.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Enjoying the role of a rebel, he astounded the scientific community, rejecting the generally accepted opinion regarding the threats of climate change caused by human actions, calling it "tribal group thinking." He doubted the validity of climate models, and infuriated experts with optimistic forecasts that they considered wishful thinking: excess carbon in the air would benefit plants, and global warming precedes another ice age.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In an article about Dyson published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009, his colleague Stephen Weinberg, a Nobel laureate, remarked: “I get the feeling that when a consensus begins to form like ice on the surface of the lake, Dyson will do everything possible to crack this ice. ” </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f17/79b/5fc/f1779b5fc38eced962883166da738b1d.jpg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dyson's distrust of mathematical models had previously made him question the predictions that atomic warfare fragments that rose into the air could overshadow the sun and lead to a nuclear winter. He said that he would like it to be that way - it could become an additional psychological means of deterring nuclear war - but he found this theory inferior.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite all his doubts about the ability of mere mortals to count on such complex things as the effects of climate change, he was confident enough in our ability to create tools to offer a technological fix to this problem. If carbon dioxide levels become too high, genetically modified trees can be planted to remove excess molecules from the air. This will free scientists for other, more urgent problems, such as ridding humanity of poverty and wars.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He considered himself an environmentalist. “I’m a Drevolub, I love frogs and forests,” he wrote in 2015 for The Boston Globe. “They do not pay attention to more urgent and real problems, such as overfishing in the oceans and destruction of terrestrial habitats of animals, while environmental activists spend time and energy talking about climate change.” Few people shared this position, to put it mildly. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He was a religious man, but in an unorthodox sense, considering good deeds more important than theology. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Science is interesting because it is full of unsolved mysteries, but religion is also interesting,” he said during his speech when he received the Templeton Prize. "The greatest unsolved mysteries are the mysteries of the existence of us, intelligent beings, in the far corner of the vast Universe."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Freeman John Dyson was born December 15, 1923 in the village of Crowthorne, Berkshire, England. His father, George Dyson, was a composer and conductor. The family’s archive contains an unfinished story that Freeman began to write when he was 8 years old - it told of a fictional expedition to the moon to observe an imminent collision with an asteroid. Among the books that the boy read, in addition to the works of Jules Verne, there were popular science literature by authors such as </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">James Hopwood Jeans</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Arthur Stanley Eddington</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - British physicists who were inclined to popularize science. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After graduating from school at Winchester College, where his father taught music, he enrolled at Trinity College at Cambridge University, where he excelled in mathematics.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In search of opportunities to participate in the war, not contradicting his pacifist views, in 1943 he went to work as a civilian scientist in the control of the Royal Air Force bombers. He was given the task of planning more effective bombing with the help of mathematics. Many years later, in an interview with physicist and historian Sylvan Schweber, he talked about the torment, which he himself assessed as moral cowardice, comparing himself to the Nazi bureaucrats, "counting how to kill people most economically." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Enthusiastic about the theoretical frontiers discovered during military research on nuclear fission, Dyson returned to Cambridge and concentrated on becoming a physicist. Having a bachelor's degree in mathematics, he enrolled in physical graduate school at Cornell in 1947, the teacher in the cat was</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hans Bethe</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , former leader of the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Manhattan project</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Traveling around the USA next summer, Dyson solved one pressing problem of theoretical physics. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5af/d22/d72/5afd22d725f7f4d791b72853bce51111.jpg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dyson in 1963,</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Richard Feynman, then a young professor at Cornell, invented a new method for describing the behavior of electrons and photons (and antiparticles of electrons, positrons). But two other physicists, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Julian Schwinger</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sinichiro Tomonaga</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , independently proposed a completely different method. Each of them seemed to satisfy the requirements of both quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativity — two litmus test papers of nature. But which one was true?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the intersection of Nebraska on the Greyhound bus, Dyson had a revelation: these theories were mathematically equivalent. These were different ways of describing the same thing. So QED was born. Feynman called it "the gem of physics - our best asset." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the time Dyson published the details of his idea in 1949, his doctorate probably seemed to him an unnecessary formality. He was appointed professor of physics at Cornell in 1951. But he soon realized that teaching was not his. In 1953, he became a scientist at the Institute for Advanced Studies, where he spent the rest of his career.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dyson did not envy Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga for the 1965 Nobel Prize they received. “I think that with almost no exceptions, to get a Nobel Prize, you need to be able to concentrate on one problem for a long time, find a deep and important task, and work on it for 10 years without a break,” he told The Times Magazine in 2009. “It my style". </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He preferred to skip from one task to another, alternating theory and practice. In the 1950s, as a consultant at General Atomics in San Diego, he helped design the TRIGA reactor, used for research and nuclear medicine, and worked on the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Orion</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> manned nuclear-powered spacecraft project </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to study the solar system.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After the signing of the agreement on the prohibition of testing nuclear weapons in 1963, Dyson's dreams of reaching Saturn by 1970 were destroyed. Despite this disappointment, he supported the treaty and sometimes, as a member of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">JASON</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , a group of independent consultant scientists, advised the US government on disarmament and defense issues. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, his interests did not end on the surface of the Earth. In a work published in 1960, he noted that any advanced civilization should eventually develop to a state where it needs all the energy that its star system can provide. And the final solution to this problem would be to build a shell around the star - the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dyson sphere</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- would capture all her energy. In a thought experiment, he reasoned that earthlings could achieve this by dismantling Jupiter into parts and reassembling them in a new way. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd6/7fa/61f/cd67fa61fb7d22ff4284529878ca7015.jpg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dyson in 2016</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Meanwhile, Dyson supported the more familiar forms of solar energy, while urging astronomers looking for extraterrestrial intelligence to pay attention to the heat that enclosed stars could emit. As for the colonization of other planets by humanity, he proposed to develop a Dyson tree genetically modified in order to grow on comets, creating an atmosphere suitable for breathing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He also continued to do less bizarre work. She and colleague Endoy Lenard won a bottle of champagne in a dispute, proving </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pauli’s ban principle</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, in which two fermions (for example, electrons) cannot be in the same quantum state, due to which matter remains stable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1965, Dyson received </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the Danny Heinemann Prize</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> [in the field of mathematical physics], which in prestige is second only to the Nobel Prize. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Few properties of the surrounding world, outstanding or mundane, did not interest his curious mind. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among his works is the derivation of a mathematical equation that describes the seam of a baseball that he thought was beautiful.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the late 1970s, Dyson threw all his energy into writing books. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any person who is interested in science and appreciates good literature will probably have several of his books on the shelf: “Perturbing the Universe”, “Weapons and Hope”, “Infinite in all directions”, “Sun, genome and the Internet”.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He also entered the literature in another way. He appeared in John McPhee's book The Binding Energy Curve (1974), describing Ted Taylor, the nuclear physicist who led the Orion project, and in Kenneth Brower's book, Star Ship and Canoe (1978). In a memorable scene, Brower describes Dyson's reunion with his son George, who abandoned high technology to live in a tree house in British Columbia and build a canoe that can walk on the sea. George Dyson then returned to civilization and became a technology historian and author of books. Dyson's daughter Esther Dyson is a well-known investor in Silicon Valley.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to them and their daughter Mia, Dyson has a second wife, Aymme Dyson; three more daughters, Dorothy Dyson, Emily Dyson Scott and Rebecca Dyson; adopted daughter Katarina Hafely, and 16 grandchildren. Dyson was married to mathematician Verena Huber, but divorced her. She died in 2016. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dyson's living mind worked to the very end. In 2012, at the age of 88, he, together with William Press, wrote a paper on the prisoner's dilemma, a mathematical concept that is important for understanding human behavior and the nature of evolution. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Over the age of 90, Dyson was still advising the government on nuclear reactor design and the new CRISPR gene editing technology. In 2018, when he turned 95, his book, Pattern Creator: An Autobiography in Letters, was published.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In his speech at the presentation of the Templeton Prize, Dyson suggested that the universe is governed by the "principle of maximum diversity", ensuring that it develops in the "most interesting" way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether this principle is important or not for physics, it definitely describes the course of its unusual life.</font></font></div>
