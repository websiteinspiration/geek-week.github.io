It is no secret that life in cities and cities carries many hidden things that you are not able to notice at first sight. This also applies to wireless networks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Over time, when I connected to my home wireless network, I began to see an </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">increasing number of available networks</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the list </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. I got the idea why, by my own example, not reduce this amount by one network when I sleep, or leave the room for a long time. Having studied the information in available sources, I came to the conclusion that I need a hardware device that could work autonomously, without meaningful control of it. Disabling on schedule or manually did not suit me.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I was puzzled by the search for a relay that could manage the power supply and at the same time could have a long delay in returning to its original state. As a basis, I used the timer RVO-1M. I got acquainted with the products of this manufacturer thanks to the publications of Electroshaman, and also used other modifications to protect the input from normal deviations. Perhaps some of you will consider my post to be advertising. But I really haven‚Äôt received so far from this profit, except for the advantages that I will indicate below. Any device that can close the load contacts when the sensor is triggered is suitable as a motion relay, and is powered by a single-phase household network directly, without using power supplies. I chose DR-06.</font></font><br>

This is a photo relay with a motion sensor. I turned off the photoresistor function by adjustment, but in the future it can be used to control the lighting at the sensor installation site. I did not want to program, so this solution seemed to me very simple and reliable. I tried as simple as possible to explain the processes that take place in the scheme so that the article is understandable to children. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's look at the connection diagram:</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Black is phase, blue is zero, yellow is earth. This phase is just that wire in which energy flows. Initially, the vibrations of the electrons are transmitted from the input to the circuit breaker, then passing through the circuit breaker they enter a small terminal box and are distributed to the motion and time relays. The motion relay at this moment starts working due to the fact that it is connected by pin N to the input. But our motion relay will not close the contacts N and L` until there is movement near it. At this point, we will accept the fact that there is no movement in our system yet and everyone is sleeping, or there is no one in the room, and let us return to what we are now looking at with the time relay. Electron vibrations reached contact A1 and due to the fact that our time switch is connected by contact N to the input, the device is ready for operation.Contacts 15 and 18 are normally open, that is, until the time relay has tripped 15 and 18 are not connected. To connect the contacts 15 and 18, it is necessary to connect the contacts A1 and Y1, that is, to make the electrons vibrate on the contact Y1. Now let's accept the fact that the movement in the apartment has begun and the motion sensor has triggered. Contacts L and L` in the motion sensor are closed. And this fact will just cause the fact that voltage appeared on pin Y1 of the motion relay, that is, the electrons there began to vibrate. Without delving into those processes that occur inside the time relay, what happened is that pins 15 and 18 are connected. And we got that pin 15 passed the voltage to the Schuko outlet, which our wireless equipment is connected to. That‚Äôs all according to the scheme.To connect the contacts 15 and 18, it is necessary to connect the contacts A1 and Y1, that is, to make the electrons vibrate on the contact Y1.

The time relay has different operating modes. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I chose mode number 24. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The time interval is set by the switches on the relay itself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the adjustment inside the interval is made by a circular regulator on the relay case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The time interval can be adjusted from 0.3 seconds to 10 hours. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yt/ta/ja/yttajapvz4lmoyabjwizbsiuita.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I chose an interval of 10-100 minutes. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And he set the regulator inside the range to about 4. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In mode No. 24, when the control contact Y1 closes, contacts 15 and 18 close and the countdown starts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The countdown is interrupted by re-closing the control contact Y1. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Contacts 15 and 18 will open if the interval between external start commands is longer than the set time delay. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The relay turns on when the next external </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
start </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">command is received </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font><br>

I installed a motion sensor in the corridor, the corridor is the center of all routes in the current apartment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a new place of housing, I will most likely install a sensor in the living room, or I will use several sensors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important to select a long-range sensor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My current sensor triggers an arm movement of 8 meters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I chose the infrared range.</font></font></li>
