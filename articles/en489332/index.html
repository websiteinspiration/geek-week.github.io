The collected materials and facts from anonymous sources or from the memoirs of special services veterans can be doubted, because the human factor and subjective judgments have not been canceled. Even a story about the weather last summer from the lips of two people will be different, let alone secret judgments about past events. Therefore, the purpose of the article is not to evaluate the special services, but to consider the technical potential of the KGB in the ‚Äúphoto direction‚Äù business. Photographic works in intelligence occupied and occupy a special place. In the 14th department of PSU there was an active training of officers in the direction of special photography, they received the nickname "fotiki". The trainees, performing the simplest assignments - from studying the rules of portrait photography to mastering complex imported models of cameras -,dreamed of career growth and the phrase: "and your employee (called last name) is a photographer from God."</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Photo direction officers were a team of intellectuals, a caste of specialists, especially valued at PSU. The activities of an OT (operational technical control) officer abroad were largely connected with the use of a wide variety of photographic equipment, from photocopying machines and cameras for covert (inconspicuous) shooting of people to miniature secret cameras in fountain pens, lighters, and even lipstick. All these different photosystems and cameras required special techniques for processing photographic film, special skills in printing photographs, often in large numbers, achieving the readability of each photo clip. And all this had to be done competently and without errors by an OT resident employee, not forgetting about other important areas of his work.</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the post-war years, all Soviet intelligence officers had to be proficient in microphotography: be able to make a micro-point, and securely hide it in a regular subject. The test for readiness was the task of detecting a hidden micro-point, extracting, developing, drying and reading. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A little bit about the micro-point. Microdots or microdots allowed to squeeze a large amount of information into a miniature microfilm. Microdot technology reduced images hundreds of times. This was part of a standard film, on which, together with ordinary frames, an image was placed that could not be seen with the naked eye without special magnifying equipment. Such a micro-point was cut out and pasted, for example, in the text of the book instead of a dot (at the end of the sentence), its location was agreed upon between the agents in advance.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Miniature Hidden Sunset Surveillance Camera</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sunset - a miniature hidden surveillance camera manufactured at the Krasnogorsk Mechanical Plant (USSR). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a small optical-mechanical plant, it began its work back in 1929, here they were engaged in the production of microscopes and optical glasses for medical institutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, a special workshop was established for the manufacture of photographic equipment and optical systems for the needs of special services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Zakhod camera was released in 1989, it can be considered the successor to the F-21 Ajax and F-27 Neocyte cameras, mainly used by the Soviet KGB intelligence agency and was in production at least until 1992.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/pq/px/rwpqpx9zznaxvj5clgdrlsbe4lw.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The dimensions of the automated camera Sunset were 96 x 65 x 29 mm (with a lens), weight - no more than 230 grams, the camera was about the same size as the F-27 Neocyte. The camera was intended for photographing from a distance of 3 to 7 meters on an unperforated film of the ZP-80 type, 16 mm wide and 0.08-0.1 mm thick. Automatic installation of the exposure made it possible to get high-quality negatives in a variety of photographing conditions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/ep/sn/oeepsnolmy5p-b74lwf7mhiljfm.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The sunset was designed specifically for surveillance, surveillance. It could be discreetly hidden in various objects, for example, inside a bag, in the passenger compartment or in a piece of furniture, behind a button of a coat or adapted on the body of an operative. In fact, the same types of camouflage were used for Sunset as for its predecessors - the old mechanical camera F-21 Ajax and electronic F-27 Neocyte. To hide the most "eye-catching" part of the camera - the lens, a special nozzle with sliding shutters was used, it was mounted on the corner bracket. During photography, by pressing the large brown button on the remote control, the shutter curtains were first opened on the camera, a picture was taken, and the hole was closed again. All this happened very quickly "without noise and dust",and to notice in practice this process was simply impossible.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The camera was stored in a case with a zipper made of leatherette. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The entire kit was placed in a gray wooden box measuring 28 x 20 x 5.5 cm. The camera and the box were marked with a five-digit number: the first two digits indicated the year of manufacture, the next three digits were the serial number. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the case, in addition to the camera, there were battery-operated remote controls, a power control unit, film cassettes, various plaits, a napkin, a round squirrel hair brush, a set of tools and accessories, two nozzles without a lock and one nozzle with a lock, two cases for cassettes. </font></font><br>

The main parts of the camera Sunset:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">camera </font></font></li>

</ul><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ph/cu/rq/phcurql556pivwg6hxbqikblsg4.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The camera was equipped with two lenses: a standard 2.8 / 25 mm lens with automatic exposure control TTL-exposure meter, and a interchangeable lens. </font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TTL exposure meter (Through the lens, TTL: ‚Äúthrough the lens‚Äù) is a type of built-in exposure meter that measures the brightness of the scene being shot directly through the camera or movie camera lens. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For some time, the Soviet literature on photography used the concept of ‚Äúinternal light measurement‚Äù and the corresponding abbreviation ‚ÄúBC‚Äù, for example, in the name of the camera ‚ÄúZenit-15 BC‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, later this designation was supplanted by the international term TTL.</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The standard lens consisted of 4 components, each of which was fixed in its frame:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">positive meniscus</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">glued positive meniscus</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">biconcave lens</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">biconvex lens</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the front of the camera is a hole with a thread M 13x0.5, used to mount the lenses. On the left side of the camera is an integrated cable approximately 20 cm long with a 14-pin subminiature plug for connecting to various control devices. On the left side of the case was a frame counter. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The camera was powered by 3 V and 5 V nickel-cadmium batteries, which were located inside both remote controls. The batteries could be recharged by connecting the charging cable to an external power source (PSU). </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0_/ag/qg/0_agqgxrlmsmg-5kzp2_b63w2pc.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Above in the image is a set of spare cassettes. The cassette was intended for storage and transportation of film 1.2 meters long (at least 30 frames). It consisted of three detachable nodes: a housing, a cover and a receiving coil.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The kit included 3 cassettes, because the photo surveillance process could not be interrupted, and therefore the agents needed to be provided with a sufficient supply of film. One cassette was installed inside the camera, and two other spare ones were stored in a wooden box. Each such reserve with a film was stored in a small case made of leatherette and easily fit in an operative‚Äôs pocket. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The remote control with a fixed cable was connected to the camera, on the left of it was an ON and OFF mode switch. The big brown button is the shutter button. Using the two switches on the right (both keys moved together), it was possible to choose between automatic and fixed 1/30 sec. expositions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/xv/q7/rwxvq7tkou0pro9mylgflqywcja.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to the standard control panel, a remote control with an expanded set of functions was also developed. In it, the ON / OFF switch has been moved to the right side panel. The leftmost switch was used to select the ONE / NPR camera mode (single / continuous). </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nr/hf/2p/nrhf2p0mvgfhxpepqozpqbmw9ag.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to the large brown button on the device, the camera shutter could be controlled using an additional button by connecting it to the 2-pin connector (located next to the cable entry). </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/1v/_8/ef1v_8itcxndpu3qkglfw2an_1y.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Such a shutter control button was simply indispensable if the camera had to be masked on the agent‚Äôs body: the cable passed through the sleeve of the operative‚Äôs dressing gown and connected to an extended remote control, which, in turn, was connected to the camera. In case of cable breakage, an additional kit was supplied.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The power control unit was designed to control the supply voltage of the battery batteries of the remote control panels of cameras. Such a unit consisted of a housing, two plastic covers and an electronic unit. At the bottom there are two three-pin connectors for connecting to the console connectors through the holes. On the front panel of the device are two LEDs under 3 V and 5 V, respectively. Their glow signaled that the batteries of the remote control batteries are operational. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Extension. Both the camera itself and the remote controls came with a relatively short cable. Although in practice this was enough for most types of camouflage, but there could be a situation for which the wire would be short. This problem was solved simply - an extension cable in the form of a 30 cm cable with 14-pin plugs at both ends.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The camera and its accessories had to be stored in packing crates, in dry rooms (preferably in a cabinet or on a shelf) away from heating radiators or windows, the temperature should not be lower than +5 ¬∞ C and not higher than +35 ¬∞ C, humidity should not exceed 80% It was possible to transport the cameras in the packing crates at temperatures from -40 ¬∞ C to +50 ¬∞ C. To prevent fogging of the chambers (when transferring from different temperature conditions), the boxes should be unpacked no earlier than 12 hours later.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1992, the last film camera Zakhod appeared in the arsenal of Russian special services. For her, camouflage covers ‚Äúattache-case‚Äù, ‚Äútrouser belt‚Äù, ‚Äúmen's bag‚Äù and others were developed. A later version of the camera Sunset came with one remote control, which required only one 6V power source. Such a remote control was thicker and had a rounded handle, there were round nickel-cadmium batteries in the handle. In the ‚Äúflattened‚Äù part of the handle are a rectangular plastic shutter-release button and a switch.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Sunset kit was presented at several international exhibitions in Moscow and abroad. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2011, at the Vienna auction of rare photographic equipment, the Sunset kit was sold for $ 7,000. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to check the bins of the motherland - perhaps someone is gathering dust and such an expensive rarity ...</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cameras Kiev</font></font></h3><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not a Soviet camera - this is a German camera made in the Soviet Union.</font></font></blockquote><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5s/ab/_z/5sab_zrk0xeqx6mmlfjlstk2ow0.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not only the Krasnogorsk Mechanical Plant (USSR) was engaged in the production of cameras for use by the KGB secret service. After the Second World War, the factory that engaged in the production of the Contax camera was completely exported from Germany to Kiev (together with specialists, spare parts and accessories). The Arsenal plant became its bridgehead, or rather the oldest part of it, built back in 1764, a room with small windows and walls 1.3 m thick. Here the production of cameras continued. At the end of the 40s, the camera acquired its new name ‚ÄúKiev‚Äù and was successfully produced, in 1947 the first two models saw the light. Although they repeated the construction of Contax-II and Contax-III (Kiev II and Kiev III), they were not plagiarized, they were legally authorized copies of Contax. Kiev was a high quality product, a status item,it was possible to get such a thing only with the help of dignitaries in the USSR. In 1956, sync contact was introduced, the series began to receive the ‚ÄúA‚Äù index, new models Kiev-2A and Kiev-3A appeared. At the end of the 50s, 3.5 thousand cameras were produced monthly at the Arsenal plant. Consider several models of Kiev, which, due to the miniature size, can be attributed to "spy" cameras.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tiny 16 mm camera Kiev-30</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Kiev-30 camera was a miniature 16 mm camera, was released in 1974. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She was the successor to the popular Vega range of Kiev cameras (a copy of the miniature Minolta 16 camera).</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zi/qv/ay/ziqvayz8ufkka2etztjiviqa_cq.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The camera shot on non-perforated film 16 mm wide, the frame size was 17 x 13 mm. The film length could be 45 or 65 cm, the number of frames 17 or 25, respectively, depended on it. The film was in a plastic cassette. The camera was equipped with an Industar-M lens with a focal length of 23 mm and aperture of f / 3.5, with 5 different apertures (3.5 - 11) - which made it possible to set the aperture from f3.5 to f11 with all intermediate values ‚Äã‚Äã- and 3 speeds shutter. The shutter is a curtain with metal shutters, only 3 shutter speeds were repulsed - 1/30, 1/60, 1/200. The diaphragm of the lens is two-petalled and formed a square hole. The exposure calculator was presented in the form of weather symbols with manual setting of exposure parameters. The exposure was set by two ribbed wheels on the right side of the body.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/rz/oe/nerzoevuiwqgvtqjmxqkgdbhtqi.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The dimensions of the camera were 84 x 46 x 27 mm (when closed), and the device weighed no more than 178 grams. Before taking a picture, the camera had to be laid out, as shown in the figure below. At the same time, the lens opened, the frame was transported, the focus wheel and the shutter button became available. In fact, the body was a control element. The frame counter showed the number of frames shot. The shooting process itself looked like this: cocking the shutter, setting the shutter speed and aperture, sighting and focusing, releasing the shutter.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now the user could see the subject through a small frame viewfinder located on the left side. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The square shutter-release button was on the right, closer to the front edge of the camera. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To the left of the shutter-release button is the focus control (from 50 cm to infinity). </font></font><br>

</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Due to its small size and small focusing range, the camera was suitable for covert photography. It was used by special services of the former Soviet Union (USSR), such as the KGB. Although a small, convenient camera has been universally recognized among backpackers. In 1987, Kiev-30 was replaced by Kiev-30M, and in 1990 an improved model of Kiev-303 came out. The plant gave a year of warranty on the replacement of components and repair of the camera, of course, subject to "normal operation, careful handling and proper storage." The retail price of the Kiev-30 camera in 1974 was 30 rubles, and the Kiev-30M in 1989 cost 15 rubles. In the film "Adventures of Electronics", the hero of the film Uri takes "spy" photographs of Electronics and Syroezhkin just with the Kiev-30 camera.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Soviet 16-mm Kiev-30 camera in action: for disguise, it was mounted in a metal case, under the guise of a cigarette pack. The shooting was carried out at the moment when the agent pulled a cigarette out of the pack. For reliability, a real cigarette was inserted into the package. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/xe/j_/raxej_actsa5yhni5ss39mvzg_k.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The popularity of such a spy camera for the KGB was high. Therefore, especially for collectors (already in the digital photo age), Kiev-30, Kiev-303 began to be produced in an unusual design, which directly hinted at its ‚Äúspy‚Äù past. Kiev-JPS is a Kiev-30 camera disguised as a regular cigarette pack of John Player Special (JPS) brand cigarettes.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9o/vl/87/9ovl87pavs6jjuewkxprtrhvnnq.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This disguise made the camera invisible to secret photography. All the same dimensions are 102 x 55 x 28.5 mm, in a case made of ferrous metal and weighing about 230 grams. One end was changed so that the camera looked like a cigarette pack, for the sake of similarity, three cigarettes (their filters) stick out a little from the pack. Two of these cigarettes are in a fixed position, and the third (longest) is movable (in or out). </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/md/wy/kxmdwy7ygs0tumiwzxuk5i33keq.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A cigarette is associated with a film transport mechanism. If you pull it, the lens opens, the film transported the next frame and you could take a picture. Although it was originally supposed that this version of the camera was made specifically for the KGB, it later became clear that this was most likely a deception of naive western collectors.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to users, the quality of the Kiev-30 images was not very high, due to two main reasons. The film was badly scratched. The narrow film was then in short supply, and therefore it was often used heavily overdue. The film had to be washed well during development, since strong spots could remain. </font></font><br>

The camera could be purchased in five colors: black, green, red, white and gray. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The small dimensions of the camera made it an indispensable assistant in the arsenal of agents and operatives: in the closed state - 84 x 46 x 27 mm and weighing no more than 178 grams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The case, like Kiev-30, was a control element. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Film rewinding (16 mm non-perforated) was not possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was possible to change the cassette at any time, while only a small part of the film was illuminated. </font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kiev-35A</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Kiev-35A camera was produced at the Arsenal factory (Ukraine) from 1985 to 1991. The camera was a 1974 Minox 35EL copy with a Color-Minotar lens, which managed to win the love of surveillance agents during the Cold War. A miniature 35 mm camera with a fixed five-lens MS Corsair 2.8 / 35 lens. Lens resolution: center 50lin / mm along the edge 28lin / mm. The camera with automatic exposure with a shutter speed of up to 1/1000 s, in addition, the shutter speed could be set manually from 4 to 1/500 sec. It worked on battery or a set of disk elements with a voltage of 6 V. The front wall was folding. As soon as the wall reclined, the lens extended into working position, the shutter button was no longer locked, the exposure meter was turned on. The cocking of the shutter and rewinding of the film was carried out by double translation of the trigger.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Kiev-35A is a full-format semi-automatic camera from the diaphragm with a frame size of 24x36 mm. The shutter is a central inter-lens electronic control, the shutter platoon is trigger. Focusing on a scale from 1 m to infinity. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The dimensions of the camera were 101.5 x 64 x 32.5 mm, weight - less than 200 grams, temperature operation from -15 to +45 C. In the closed state it could fit in any pocket.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although the Kiev-35A and Minox 35EL cameras look identical at first glance, the build quality of Kiev 35A still desires the best. The Soviet version was "famous" for its numerous electronic crashes. The camera could not be dropped even half a meter. The camera used a galvanic, pointer exposure meter, it was connected with the electronic shutter of the camera, the most delicate mechanism was damaged at the slightest impact. Without such a fragile ‚Äúspring with an arrow‚Äù, the camera could no longer function. They tried to eliminate this weak spot in the Kiev-35AM model, replacing the pointer meter in 1991 with a LED indicator. </font></font><br>

Such stationary systems were designed for long time shooting, it could last for hours, or even several days. The cameras were automatic, with a clockwork (later an electronic timer), which made it possible to take one frame in 5, 10 or 15 seconds. The cameras were equipped with special cassettes for 100, 200 or more frames. Such equipment was called "mortgage" between the investigators, it was masked / laid in pre-selected camouflage cover. Often such a cover served as interior items, furniture elements: vases, flowerpots, wall paintings. Holes were made in the walls, ceiling, ventilation, hollow ceilings and ledges were constructed.</font></font><br>

Laurel (Laurel-5, Laurel-6), Honeysuckle, Moroznik - the first "embedded" stationary cameras with various lenses and attachments. KGB agents, starting in the 70s, began to actively use stationary cameras Run, they are considered the most successful embedded devices of the time. </font></font><br>

Reliable, autonomous, silent camera - a real find for intelligence and counterintelligence services. Such special equipment was installed in offices, hotel rooms. In the hotels "Russia", "Moscow", "National" even existed specially equipped for observation rooms. An old and proven method of tacit photography was a system of mirrors that were pre-installed at different angles, giving the agent even more options for taking incriminating shots at different angles and from different angles.</font></font><br>

The race camera was designed with automatic shutter speed, which was controlled according to the room‚Äôs lighting. The Run worked on batteries, the capacity of which was selected depending on the duration of the operation. Using the control panel, pictures were taken, the timer set the time to start shooting, for example, every 15 minutes (or every hour, etc.). The right handle of the control panel set the shooting cycle, the left - set the sensitivity used in the camera film in relative units: 32, 45, 140, 250 units (GOST). This camera used non-perforated 12 mm film in special cartridges.</font></font><br>

In practice, there were cases of special services in which the classic formula of the incriminating operation ‚Äúalcohol + sex‚Äù simply did not work, and photographic equipment had nothing to do with it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Somehow, the observed convinced KGB operatives that the compromising shots would only kindle their intimate life with his wife and add a twinkle to the relationship. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The object of compromising stated that he and his wife are passionate lovers of porn movies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, the KGB agents didn‚Äôt expect such a finale, as a result - the foreigner politely refused any cooperation, and also asked for a souvenir copy of ‚Äúbeautifully made‚Äù photographs.</font></font><br>
