<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Curators help cope with the organization, time management, prioritize and solve problems with self-confidence. In a post they tell why they decided to do this, what they learned in the process and what problems freshmen most often face.</font></font><br>

<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to the results of the first enrollment in “Applied Mathematics and Computer Science” at the St. Petersburg HSE (summer 2019), we entered the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">top five most sought after</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> among applicants programs in the field of “Mathematics” in Russia. The passing score on the budget is 296 for three USEs. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this post,</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> we already talked about the results of enrollment for the first year of undergraduate studies. Let us briefly recall: in order to understand the amount of students' input knowledge, on September 1 we conducted testing in mathematics, programming and algorithms. According to its results, freshmen were divided into two streams of 45 people and into groups of 15. The groups were numbered in descending order of the results obtained on the entrance test, and a curator from among senior students of the same program was assigned to each of them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After the first semester, changes occurred: the flows were combined into one, and the students were redistributed into groups. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are currently four of them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We talked with the curators of these groups Ilya Kaysin, Igor Tukh, Anya Shvetsova and Anya Nikiforovskaya and the curator of the entire first year, Yegor Suvorov.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Supervision</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4a/7a2/a6b/d4a7a2a6bdffb713b87f349f24a7a726.jpg" width="300" align="left"><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who are the curators? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are their responsibilities? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova (4th year student, curator of 3 groups):</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We communicate with people. We find out what students have problems and how we can help with them. For example, if the group as a whole has difficulty understanding some material, we agree on an additional pair for this material. When one of the students thinks “I’m sad, I can’t do anything”, we give advice on what you can do about it. We also monitor performance - everyone in their group. If a freshman has obvious problems, but he doesn’t think about them yet - for example, if academic performance in a subject has fallen sharply - we talk with him, ask what he thinks about it, and decide how to help him. We have groups of 15 people, so you can pay attention to everyone. And there is Egor - he is the curator of the course as a whole. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Egor Suvorov (2nd year student, curator of the 1st course):</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am contacted if I could not resolve the issue at the group level or if it relates to the entire first course. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How was the idea of ​​curating born? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Egor Suvorov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At SPbAU, where we studied before, there were usually about 40 students, and our dean Alexander Vladimirovich Omelchenko personally remembered and knew everyone. Although this year the enrollment was almost twice as large, the idea arose to pay more attention to each student. So curators appeared. Not always complete information is reflected in written surveys, and in person can react faster. There is also an institute of curators in HSE itself, but so far we don’t interact with them and carry out other tasks. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How were the curators of our program searched? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Egor Suvorov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was no strict selection or mass attraction. They simply looked at familiar older students, thought about who would be suitable, and offered them. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In general, some of us began to communicate with the first year before our studies began. The guys in the chat of the applicants were worried and were actively interested in what awaited them, so we wanted to help them somehow. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Nikiforovskaya (4th year student, curator of the 4th group):</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We decided to talk about what is needed in the first year. From the first weeks, the delivery of homework begins, and almost all the work needs to be taken in Tex. In many subjects, almost immediately they stop taking handwritten notes. We wanted people to get used to it faster, and organized a mini-course in Tex in the summer for everyone. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were three of us: me, Anya, and Anton Ermilov. In the chat, we gave out small tasks in which complexity gradually increased and some new elements appeared. Each assignment was accompanied by links to materials that would help to fulfill it. Sometimes the guys sent decisions to us in PM, we watched them and somehow commented. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During this course, we met well and decided to continue to help the guys after. </font></font><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/828/99f/0bb/82899f0bb8eb8b13965aa45389318d4f.jpg" width="300" align="right"> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Nikiforovskaya:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> When it turned out that they were looking for curators for freshmen, we just came and said: “We would like to.” </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Igor Tukh (4th year student, curator of the 2nd group):</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although I did not communicate with the first year as closely as Ani, I heard a cry and thought it was an interesting opportunity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I had a mercantile reason. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone knows that sooner or later a developer can be brought into managers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In curatorship - it’s clear that it’s completely different - but still the opportunity to chat with people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This may also be useful. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ilya Kaysin (1st year student, curator of the 1st group):</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> And Alexander Vladimirovich came up to me in the dining room and suggested. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So I became a curator </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(laughs).</font></font></i><br>
 <br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Excellent student complex, impostor syndrome, time management and other problems of freshmen</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is there a difference between overseeing the first and fourth groups? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Nikiforovskaya:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the fourth group, many have problems with self-confidence. Like, there is the first group, they are so cool, but we are not like that, and in general, maybe this place is not for us. At this moment, I always remember that in our first year there was no uniformity. We had both people with experience and without experience. Both the olympiadniki and the people who entered the exam. By the fourth course, both the first and second remained.</font></font><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/3e2/1d4/9de3e21d41ad3626d863e0d1ef84a6cc.jpg" width="300" align="right"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The fourth group was in the second stream, and this fact additionally pressed on some guys. Although, in fact, the program was not simplified for the second stream. If for some reason the teacher had to explain something in more detail at the lecture, and because of this, he did not have time to tell some piece of material, then they arranged additional pairs on this subject. The program for the second stream was the same, the same questions on exams. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my fourth group, three out of sixteen people completed both modules “good” and “excellent”. And this is a great result! During the study, these guys were worried that they did not compare with the guys from the groups above, but in fact their objective results are the same. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, it is worth saying that it is easier for people who have had olympiad experience or the experience of school physics students before entering here to study. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Nikiforovskaya:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you haven’t had a lot of study intensity before, it’s hard to join in from the first weeks. And before the exams, and before the deadlines, I literally told students in what order to do the work, if you have N deadlines ahead, or how to make sure that you don’t get nervous on the exam. People with olympiad experience are better prepared for some moments, because olympiads are not so different from exams. And there, and there is a certain level of stress, excitement, to which the Olympiad quickly get used to. “Yes, I’m a little worried, but I can handle it, and I can work in this excitement. I’m even pleased. ” People who do not have this skill, of course, are more difficult. Especially at first. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ilya Kaysin:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first group has almost no learning problems. You ask them how they are doing - they say: "Everything is in order." Although there are difficulties, for example, with self-confidence. Some of the guys at the school were among the first, but here they are forced to work hard and are afraid to go down to the group below. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Igor Tukh:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the second group, the situation is a bit contradictory: on the one hand, very strong guys study in it. They usually do it themselves. On the other hand, they may have jitters out of the blue when there is really no problem. And there are also people with an “excellent student complex”. However, now everyone is more or less involved. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in the fifth group, which I supervised initially, and in the third, which I supervise now, there were students who are trying to close one subject perfectly and disappear in all the rest. In such cases, you need to help a person with time management, with the organization. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Did you manage to help with something else? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Nikiforovskaya:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I can tell you one case at the session. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A student flies for three debts. One person from my group started the first module very well. In the second module, at first, something did not work out, and then - excitement, some small debts ... And at the end of the session two debts accumulated and the last exam remained - matan.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There was a great fear: "I will not surrender, I will not surrender, I will not surrender." And a person comes to the exam and fails the first written test. He writes to me after him: “That's it, the test is overwhelmed. Apparently, I'm flying out. It’s sad. " I answer: “So. Wait. Are you in the HSE now? ” They write to me: "In the HSE." I say: “Good. Take it easy. Drink some water. And after an hour, go back to your office and ask for an exam. Despite the fact that you failed the first test, go and take the oral part. " </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The man listened to me, went and handed over. As a result, he remained and is now studying.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I know from my own experience that teachers are living people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They understand that everything happens. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It so happened by chance that the student was worried on a written test, that he was getting a third debt, end of session, December 30th. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can go honestly admit it and show that you know everything further. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the teacher sees that the student really has a desire, of course, he will meet them.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Extra-curricular life</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b5/699/434/4b5699434d76903e45af0cbd23f0666b.jpg" width="300" align="left"><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Egor Suvorov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Guys still have time to have fun. They appear local jokes, memes, public, something else. For example, after dividing into groups in September, one student ended up in the second stream, but he had a very high level of programming, and he was clearly distinguished by grades in this subject. From this grew a public that posted every day that the student had not yet been transferred to the first stream. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now the flows have merged together and 4 groups remain. Lectures are given for everyone at once. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Students are actively discussing, is this the second stream attached to the first, or the first joined the second? They argue what remained. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what is your position? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We believe that the stream has remained the only one </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(laughs)</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Tell us about extracurricular life. </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Egor Suvorov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Curators can gather with students just like that - sometimes this also happens. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Igor Tukh:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Now all the students are more or less aligned, understand how to cope with the load, there was some free time. And this is conducive to more informal communication. But at the very beginning, when the guys were just rebuilding after school, and some had everything on fire, it would probably not be entirely correct to talk just like that. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Anya Nikiforovskaya: This fall we went to the Kochubey Center - this is one of the HSE buildings in Pushkin. And on New Year's Eve, from the time of SPbAU we regularly organize meetings and events where you can chat. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year - they gathered with the first course in mid-January to celebrate the holidays. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We played board games, I brought VR. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We talked with Alexander Vladimirovich. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was an opportunity to chat in an informal setting, while homework has not yet begun.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Results and Impressions</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do you think it would be easier for you to study if your set had such curators? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Nikiforovskaya:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> When we were in our first year, we collected feedback in questionnaires, reacted to them, but there was no individual work. I had friends who didn’t work out in the first semester, something didn’t work out, and they flew out. There is a chance that they could be explained how to study correctly, how to cope with some minor problems correctly, or they could be transferred to another group, or else reacted somehow and then they could withstand a further load. But then there were no curators, and we ourselves were freshmen and poorly understood what gives and what does not improve. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Igor Tukh:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But we had a horizontal support system. In our studies, we helped each other a lot. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Nikiforovskaya:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The curators now have no obligation to help students with their studies, for example, solve homework in algebra or matan. If only on volunteer grounds. I tried to help someone with the items in September and October, but it quickly failed me. I had to separate one from the other. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What are your impressions of the curatorial process? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Igor Tukh:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I realized that this activity is much more intense than it seems from the outside. But I am satisfied because I feel that I am doing something useful. Gained experience in resolving situations that seem unobvious. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Egor Suvorov:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I also feel that I am doing something useful. One of the insights of curatorship is the realization that living people also work in the university. Need to negotiate. Take into account the limitations of the real world. There is an opportunity in a very large number of places to improve the lives of students, if you understand how, and if there is time and resources for this. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b04/7d5/6c7/b047d56c7ac79735d4f4123452667982.jpg" width="300" align="left"><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ilya Kaysin:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It's nice to share my experience, it's nice to meet new people. It is doubly nice to meet those who have come to us. And communication skills are increasing: with both students and teachers. I would like to see how the university will develop further. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Nikiforovskaya:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I develop problem-solving skills. I learn to solve problems in principle and understand better how to communicate with people to solve these problems. Until the fourth year, I was scared to take the initiative and start organizing, even if I didn’t like something. I usually looked for someone to take the first step for me. Now I have the feeling that I can start something myself. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anya Shvetsova:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I love when I can help people with something, based on my experience. To suggest life hacks that for me at some point in time would be unexpected, but which I got in the first courses with sweat and blood. I like to simplify the work of other people when it turns out to convey some knowledge to them. Sometimes it’s not very simple: some life hacks need to be customized for people to start working. Now for me there is an interesting difficulty - to find a balance between being friendly and helping people where they ask, and having to at some point move with them to a more serious tone when there are problems that need to be discussed seriously. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what next year? </font></font></b><br>
<br>
