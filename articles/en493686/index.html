She became a world sensation. It was used in Fallout. She helped create the cybersecurity industry. But where did she come from? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“This is not interesting,” Dan Theitel thought. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fallout 3,</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> there are plenty of computer terminals, and if a player wanted to break into one of them, he had to win the mini-game, abstractly representing the hacking process. Teitel, who worked as a </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fallout</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> programmer </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">at Bethesda </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in 2007 </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, was responsible for the design of this mini-game, and he thought that the players would hate it. “It used the letters that appear on the screen and a countdown timer - another mini-game that gamers would call boring and annoying. I was not a game designer, but I considered it my duty to somehow improve this idea. "</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A few days later, still unable to come up with anything better, Teitel received an email from his friend Bob. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“It seemed to me an amazing gift from the gods ... I opened a letter with the message“ Hello, remember this? ”And a link to the online version of the game Mastermind.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Teitel was in seventh heaven. </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mastermind</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> will be an interesting game.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc3/d7f/ce8/bc3d7fce8992bb9b2b01ddc5bb5f459c.jpg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This year, the Mastermind board game dedicated to hacking codes is 50 years old. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But actually she is older, and no one knows how much. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is ironic that this is a game about breaking codes, the sources of origin could not be found.</font></font><br>

If you know Mastermind only as a shabby and rarely opened box that settled on the mezzanine or in the entertainment room of nursing homes, then you have no idea how popular it was at the time of its appearance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Invented in 1970, Mastermind was sold in 30 million copies in less than ten years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It hosted the national championship in the Playboy Club, her fan was Muhammad Ali, the Australian military officially used it for training, and in Denmark it was bought by 80% of families. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“I never thought it was possible to come up with a game again,” the Missouri toy store manager wondered in 1977. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Real classics like Monopoly.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These were good times.</font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">BoardGameGeek </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kaffedrake</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> User </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Photo</font></font></a></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you are not familiar with Mastermind at all, for example, if you have never lived in Denmark, then I will tell you a little about it. The game takes place on the field. The encoder comes up with a sequence of four multi-colored pins, and the code cracker must recreate their exact pattern in a certain number of attempts. After each attempt, the encoder can only report that the cracker has placed the pin in the right place, or that the pin is in the sequence, but is not in the right place. According to the authors of the game, a decision in five attempts is considered "better than average", and in two or less attempts - a pure success. In 1978, British teenager John Sargent won the Mastermind World Championship by solving the code in just three attempts and 19 seconds. (The second place was taken by eighteen-year-old Canadian Cindy Fort; she tellswhat kind of victory were given prizes and boxes of Mastermind.)</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mordechai Meirovitz, an Israeli telephone setup engineer, developed Mastermind in 1970 based on the already existing Bulls and Cows game of unknown origin, in which numbers were used instead of multi-colored pins. By the way, no one knows where the Bulls and Cows came from. In a conversation with me, computer experts who adapted the first known versions of the game in the 1960s recall the game in different ways: someone says that she is one hundred years old, others - that a thousand. But no matter how old it was, no one received as much from the Bulls and Cows as Meirovitz, who soon left the development of games and lived well on license fees after selling the prototype Mastermind to Invicta, a British manufacturer of plastic products, which expanded the range goods games and toys.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mastermind entered the young fast-growing market of "adult games", where the new favorites, Scrabble and Monopoly, fought for places on sales lists and on coffee tables with chess and go. “People preferred to sit at home and play backgammon, instead of spending $ 30 for dinner,” explains adult game sales manager Jock Miller. According to the psychologist, chess researcher and author of the “Official Mastermind Guide” Leslie Olta, an adult game has become a complement to a lifestyle (“a game can serve as a party element like a meal with a bowl, a bowl of nuts or a table with alcohol”), appealing to primitive human passions. “I call it the“ need for hunting, ”” he writes. In the modern world, "people pursue their prey in the form of games."</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In a conversation with </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tampa Times,</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Alt confirmed that a sexual element is also involved in the game. “A man and a woman caught up in the confrontation of an intense game can create an emotionally charged situation,” sums up the </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Times</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . “Marketing tactics, for example, the covers of games in which a man and a woman bend over a table with a meaningful look, exploit the topic of sexual arousal.”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mastermind successfully hit a number of adult games. Invicta has flooded the market with luxury, miniature, children’s, “big”, “royal” and electronic versions of the game, as well as a braille version (“It is logical to expect that people playing Electronic Mastermind will be confused with diligent workers who work hard with their calculators” , </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Louisville </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Courier-Journal</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> predicted </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">). There was even a “version of pure gold”, “with a field encrusted with diamonds and pins hand-carved from stones - agate, ivory, amber, coral and lapis lazuli”. In 1978, this option cost 29 thousand dollars (120 thousand including inflation). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to Olta, the secret to Mastermind's success is very simple. It is easy to learn how to play it, the parties are fast, the game does not require translation and rewards</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mathematical analysis</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and strategy. For example, “if the cracker thinks out loud or puts test pins on the board, then there is no need to react. If necessary, read the magazine or occupy your mind in some other way. ”</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In addition, Olt writes, there is a deeper attractive power in games. “In the modern world, the average person is constantly reminded of his powerlessness - the threat of global catastrophe caused by bombs, pollution, biological weapons and the like; about the impact of even such distant events as, for example, the Arab oil policy; about the many violations of the “big” governments of the right to life and freedoms; and about the aggravation of problems such as crime and social tension, which seem "There are no clear or effective solutions. Unlike most games, Mastermind has the answer - the only correct hidden code."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, it seems to me that the aesthetics in which Meirowitz and Invicta wrapped the Bulls and Cows seems important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In particular, I'm talking about the cover. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The original Mastermind box is adorned with a portrait of a fashionably dressed and unemotional woman bending over an elderly man sitting in a chair dressed in a suit, clutching the fingers of both hands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, according to commentators of that era:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“A graceful woman and a mysterious dude” (Les Gelber, president of the American branch president</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“An alienated bearded red-haired man and a Eurasian beauty. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The art editor asked me who they were ...

</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These powerful forces were Cecilia Fun and Bill Woodward; she was a student of computational science at the University of Leicester, he is the owner of a network of hairdressers in Leicester, also </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">known to the townspeople under the name "Mr. Sneak and Badass."</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Woodward later changed his nickname to “Mr. Mastermind” and even </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309152751/" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">claimed to have recorded the title in his passport</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . (Fung went around him, taking her husband’s surname after the wedding and becoming Cecilia Masters.) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the cover of Mastermind we don’t see “Mr. Sneak” and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309152751/" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“poor student”</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(as Cecilia herself called herself), we don’t see the woman sitting behind Fun, who is holding an oversized dress. We do not see traces of urine on Woodward's pants, which appeared after an unsuccessful attempt to photograph a cat on his knee. We see these anonymous well-dressed figures who, according to Masters, were asked to pretend to be a "sedate and mysterious" look - a hint of a "world power elite." You see the riddle and the question inextricably linked with the name of the game: Mastermind (“outstanding mind”) - who is it? he? it? or you? The aesthetics of Mastermind were appropriate for that era of James Bond, John Le Carré and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Congressional investigations into the secret activities of intelligence agencies</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. This is an example of the power of the image, or the design of the narrative: thanks to the title and cover photo, Invicita turned “Bulls and Cows” into a game of espionage and intrigue, and “Mr. Dodger and Bully” into an outstanding mind. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Bill Woodward continued to pose for the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">covers of subsequent editions of Mastermind</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but Cecilia Masters no longer participated, and not on her own initiative. After taking the picture, Masters no longer heard from Invicta, but met with one of the agents who selected her. He promised to contact her, but again no news came. “I began to notice that my roommate ran to the mailbox every morning before me. Later I found out that she was destroying letters from the studio, ”says Masters.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Cecilia’s neighbor, who was also a student in computer science, was on trial with her, and Masters thinks the neighbor was upset that she didn’t choose her. “She said she was curious to know about the results of the shooting, and when she opened and then destroyed my first letter, she had no choice but to destroy all further correspondence.” </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
itself </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">is just a new costume for an old and, to be honest, much more mysterious game. Most people don’t even know its real name. It can be found under the name “ Bulls and cows ", but most people who played it in childhood do not remember what they called it. There is no information about why it is called and how old it is. A tyrannosaurus could well invent it. And I believe that for a complete understanding of Mastermind, it is necessary to understand “Bulls and Cows”, because they are essentially the same, so I’ll immerse myself as deep as possible in history to solve this riddle.</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The very first reference to “Bulls and Cows” is found in the work of Dr. Frank King. In 1968, King studied at the PhD in Electrical Engineering at Cambridge University and was looking for a program that could be implemented on a Titan university computer, recently equipped with Multics, a time-sharing operating system that allowed multiple users to access a computer simultaneously and remotely. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Choosing a fun and slightly more complicated game than tic-tac-toe, King wrote a version of the puzzle that he played as a child. “Well, well, you wrote Bulls and Cows,” he recalls the words of a student, although the game was called MOO.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1e/5cb/827/d1e5cb827b298b141ffd6338a26716e2.jpg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Entrance to the Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory (the concept of “computer laboratory” did not yet exist).</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In addition, King implemented in it a new then for computer games feature: a rating table, or a leaderboard, in which players could record their points. “In the first few days, people competed with each other, trying to climb higher in the ranking table,” he says. “It was noticeable that people are playing better and better, but as a result, someone with an impossibly large average was at the top.”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This was a new type of security vulnerability, against which the operating systems of that time did not have natural protection. If a player in MOO had the opportunity to update one of King's files, in particular, entering his name and score in the leaderboard, then he could theoretically easily enter a false score, delete another player’s score and even change the source code itself. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
King's game hackers admitted everything, but every time he tried to eliminate the vulnerability, he was hacked again. “It was a very friendly war,” he says. “No one tried to say“ I am better than you ”, did not seek to be the first. We all worked together to improve the system. "</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/818/55e/48d/81855e48df7b1be17816b33302f8a237.jpg"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Titan 1 during commissioning, the picture was taken from the survey gallery above the laboratory.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
However, King, distracted by his PhD, did not keep up with the tricks of the hackers, which led to the intervention of the then informal Cambridge computer security group, who said that King’s problems with MOO "will become very important in the future." If you allow the user to modify the MOO rating table, this opens the door to making unwanted changes; the same can happen if the bank allows the client to carry out an electronic withdrawal of funds. And in fact, and in another case, according to King, these are just users who make changes to someone else’s file.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Cambridge Computer Security Group managed to protect MOO, but only by hiring hackers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(One of the hackers refused to explain how he hacked MOO until he was threatened with a computer ban; he ended up working in Cambridge for 50 years.) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Companies like IBM realized too late that this would happen with their own PCs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IBM mainframes of the late 1970s did not have the proper protection, ”King recalls. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cambridge bought an IBM computer and, using the patches created for MOO, increased the security of the operating system; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, today the Bulls and Cows DNA can be found not only in video games like </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fallout</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Neverwinter Nights</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sleeping Dogs</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">), but also in the basic functions of computer security.</font></font><br>

Leslie Olt recalls how Mastermind's popularity has plummeted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the child prodigy John Sargent won the first two international championships, Olta was asked to find a chess player who could defeat him in the third 1979 championship in Rome. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But then, without any notice, the whole event was canceled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“I got the impression that the hype started to subside and the market was oversaturated,” says Alt. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just as quickly, the author of the “Official Mastermind Guide” closed this chapter of his life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“My first wife stayed in California, I became a single father in Jersey ... and my father was dying of prostate cancer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Mastermind was interesting as long as it stayed afloat, but then other topics took up my attention, and I moved on.”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even Denmark, in which almost everyone had Mastermind, seemed tired of the game. I talked with many Danes who admitted that after a dozen years of hype, Mastermind simply went out of fashion in the early 80s. (However, one woman recalled “some scandal that killed the popularity of the game ... something like the game is mesmerizing.”)</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unlike the Mastermind party, there is no answer to the question about the reasons for the decline. The glut and endless variations of the game could not help her (in particular, manufacturers were warned that Mastermind should not be made of pure gold), and this excess was probably exacerbated by the inability to repeat the success of Mastermind with another game. Projects such as Omar Sharif Teaches You Bridge and Ouija (“Invicta claims that this game allows you to develop the hidden spiritualistic powers that everyone has”) could not rectify the situation. Invicta itself gradually phased out its activities and in 2013 its assets were sold; Now its intellectual property is controlled by the toy giant Hasbro.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today, Mastermind continues to produce a division of Goliath Games, but on the boxes there is not a single modern version of Bill Woodward or Cecilia Masters. Both were replaced by a photograph of the playing field itself. </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Writer Richard Mackenna describes the modern Mastermind</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> as “a box painted in abstract vibrant colors that shout that it is a toy; all traces of previous incarnations that used the ideas of success and power, which were greatly modified after the appearance of the game, now completely disappeared. ”</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Woodward and Masters' cryptic glances from outside the picture allow us to understand how they contributed to the game’s personality. In its 50 years, Mastermind no longer strives to be a chic accessory or an invitation to the battle of powerful world elites. Today it is a toy </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">indistinguishable </font></font></a> <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">from </font></font></a> <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">its </font></font></a> <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">copies</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . It's just Bulls and Cows.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Such a drastic change for the game, which is just over 50 years old, is a rather rude act. I thought about this while talking with Leslie Olt in between his visits to his wife in a nursing home for people with dementia; he recalled Mastermind tournaments at the Playboy Club. Bill Woodward passed away in 2013; his family informed me that Woodward was an “exquisite gentleman” and that his adult daughter had died in a terrible incident. Cecilia Masters has built a successful banking software development career; today she partially retired, traveled around the world and runs several summer cottages in East Sussex. According to her, Mastermind did not have much influence on her life, but she wonders if "my life would have been brighter if my friend hadn’t destroyed the letters from Invicta."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mordechai Meirovitz almost immediately after the creation of Mastermind began to participate in the educational program for gifted children, "The Odyssey of the Mind." I asked this organization if they could tell me about Meirovitsa, but no one remembered anything. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mastermind still exists, but the 50th anniversary was not an occasion to honor the game, but emphasized its withering and reminded that everything and everyone is mortal.</font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Students and staff at work at the Cambridge Mathematics Laboratory.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Frank King does not remember exactly where he learned to play “Bulls and Cows” - a game that came out of his subconscious and got into the ancient Cambridge computer Titan. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He only said that he always knew about her. “I played it as a kid in the 1950s. Probably in elementary school. ” He wonders if it is a coincidence that the friend who taught him how to play Bulls and Cows was a child of the owner of a dairy farm.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Is it possible that Mastermind has evolved from some traditional farming game? Sibon Gleeson, who grew up on a farm in the Irish county of Cork, does not think so. However, she proposed a theory explaining why the name “Bulls and Cows” was suitable for playing with numbers and classifications. “Perhaps this has something to do with cattle tags?” For example, with those that attach cows to their ears? I keep one of these tags in my jacket pocket as a reminder of my deceased father, and therefore I often recall it. Perhaps when this game appeared, only the bulls had tags with numbers? ” Gleason told her sister Mary about this riddle. Mary recognized the puzzle, but did not know that she had a name, and did not exactly remember where she had learned to play it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mastermind always has an answer. "The one and only correct hidden code." Leslie Olt wrote that he is a gift in our mysterious and chaotic world in which an ordinary person is constantly reminded of his own powerlessness. But as regards the question of the origin of Mastermind, I am inclined, in the absence of other evidence, to the fact that "this is somehow connected with what the farmers know." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But I believe that in this riddle, contrary to the spirit of the game, there is something pleasant. I like to think of Mastermind not as intellectual property with a clearly defined owner, but as one of the facets of an apparently ancient puzzle of mysterious origin, spread in history and culture like a meme, without owners and owners.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Anyway, I want to think about Mastermind not as a brand, but as an ageless idea. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Otherwise, it will turn out to be a subject that may turn 50 years old and which may die.</font></font></div>
