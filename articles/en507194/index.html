      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/507194/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“I do what I get paid for” is the standard capitalist approach to working “for uncle” in the western part of our world. At the moment, the light goes out, the machines stop and everyone goes about their business. Interestingly, the Scrum and Kanban-style methodologists who talk about teamwork also toughly draw a line between roles and who does what, when. But it is there! And we have? And our role in the team (I’ll talk about testers (QA)) correlates with knowledge from various fields, the importance of moral and spiritual balance in the team, and responsibility for the work done. All this adapts the methodologies in the teams from a slightly different angle than the west.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In particular, the testers who bear the greatest responsibility for the release of the product, in the case when they work not just from call to call, but to improve the quality and the product as a whole. Testing in the classical understanding of the public is to take part of the product or the whole product, which was made by the programmer and find errors in it, relying on the expected behavior of the user. Why can't a programmer do this? Of course it can, but the hour of the programmer’s work is somewhat more expensive, so the programmer is writing code, as if a flow line, and the tester is testing this code in the form of programs. But we must pay tribute to the fact that a good programmer always minimally tests for himself, even if he meets the minimum functional requirements. In general, the public opinion on this issue is correct,but it’s worth understanding that it applies to a June level specialist or weak tester.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 A software tester today has a key position in the release of the product, and here's why. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you watched the film Glass, you will certainly remember the wonderful diverse character of the Horde, suffering from personality disorder. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So - the more experienced, the more useful and the more professional the testing specialist, the more personality masks he can try on, but unlike the poor Horde, he is able to manage them. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today I will talk about some of them with an explanation of my position and opinion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of the article you will receive an additional list with basic questions for yourself in each of the described roles for a successful transition to a personality disorder tester (this is a joke) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
and I will start of course with:</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The mask is user!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here, in fact, everything is simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We introduce ourselves as a user and write tests based on which we run the program. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, this is the most important type of testing and is most often called Dymov, when the basic, basic functions of the product are checked for compliance with the actual result expected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you delve into this issue, you will learn many other types and levels of testing, but today we are talking more about the approach to testing.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mask - support manager</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's continue - the next role-mask, which a testing specialist should be able to try on, is the Tester-support manager. Why exactly the role of this specialist? Yes, because the first person to encounter the user after the product is launched on the market will be the support manager. Therefore, the tester should always ask myself if I did everything I could to ensure that Support did not go down after the release (in the understanding that the load on the support would increase so much that it would cease to cope with it). Here you can miss a simple detail in the product documentation (guide). Not even that something will not be described, but that even the guide itself may be poorly thought out and executed. Tooltips for fields and buttons in the application may be absent or not true (obsolete).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The support manager is a very difficult and psychologically exhausting job, and the tester has every chance of maintaining the pacified state of a colleague for a slightly longer period. </font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mask - Business Intelligence</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next, as for me, the most Important is the role of Business Intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is most important because the business analyst assumes, and the tester has and already sees much more during testing than the analyst who described the feature in the documentation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can compare it with poker: A business analyst is a player who knows the rules, knows the playing style of other players, knows what needs to be done, but doesn’t see the cards, unlike a tester who, though he doesn’t know everything, sees all the cards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, it’s obvious that the pocket cards are the same for both of them, but they sit side by side at the poker table and play as one - they are a team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All of the above boils down to the fact that the tester should be directly involved in the process of inventing new features and improving the old functionality.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mask - project manager</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Project Manager. Testing is the last step in product development before release. This means that the tester (such a good, scorched one) knows and communicates with all team members, knows the project workflow, knows how all the scrum artifacts in the team are arranged, and in which case they can be picked up and applied, for example, a demo rally or a retrospective. A good tester sees bottlenecks in the team’s processes because all of them ultimately turn testing into a weak link in the project. For example: a poor assessment of tasks was always a blunder at the end of the sprint and why the release is not ready - they did not have time to test, the lack of a code freeze means test failures and missed bugs due to constant stuffing in the test environment, who missed the bugs - testers, etc. Tester , the most responsible position in the team, as he approves the product for release, which meanshe is responsible for everything that happens next (I mean pop-up bugs), regardless of what caused this. Therefore, taking care of itself, the tester takes care of the team.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mask - Psychoanalyst</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The psychoanalyst tester (returning to the above point) communicates closely with all team members and those who work with the team indirectly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He knows the mood in the team, knows the pain and suffering of its members and, of course, how a sponge pumps it all through himself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turns out that not only is the tester himself always in the zone of high stress, but he also becomes the pillow for the bitter tears of his colleagues, which, as a result, becomes a tool for bringing employees together to further increase efficiency.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The conclusion is quite simple: you need to be able to put yourself in the place of others and if all members of the development team could and could do so, such a team would send people to Mars a long time ago. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the conclusion is simple, but in practice it is much harder to apply. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are all different, the teams are different, the customers are different, and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But do not give up, you can start with the usual morning question to a colleague - how are you? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">how is your mood?</font></font><br>
<br>
