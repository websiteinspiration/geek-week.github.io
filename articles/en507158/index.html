For the last time, Apple co-founder opens a new category of devices, relies on hardware, software, and the interface worked out before on the first iPhones. A successful attempt: tablets of the new generation are sold in millions of copies, after a couple of years they are used everywhere. Competitors are trying to repeat success on the Android platform, but they do not succeed right away.</font></font><br>

The iPad is a modern story, but this year Apple‚Äôs tablets are ten years old, which means they fall into my conditional category of ‚Äúnew retro‚Äù. In honor of the anniversary, I bought and tested an ancient tablet, but the experience here is not very important: everyone already knows how it works. In the history of the iPad and other modern tablets, something else is interesting. First, how long the industry has been working on wearable devices with a touch screen and without a keyboard to the iPad. Secondly, how fast the highly promising device category has become niche again.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
My first tablet appeared in the eighties, in childhood. It was not a computer, but a plastic A4 panel with a paper holder. A handy thing for taking notes on the go when there is no way to ‚Äúwork with documents‚Äù on the table. Of all the computer devices, the tablet is perhaps the closest to natural storage media without batteries: books, magazines, birch bark letters and Egyptian </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">clay tablets</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . The concept of a computer tablet, in turn, did not originate in military laboratories and private research centers. And in science fiction.</font></font><br>

Stanley Kubrick is now often referred to as the "inventor of the iPad" in the 2001 Space Odyssey movie. The film was shot in 1968, but please: space travelers use something very familiar, thin and lightweight devices with a screen, with the ability to play video. In the cinema there is generally a demand for visually pleasing technologies, without the burden of keyboards, disk drives, punch cards and cables. It was guessed very accurately. When did the real predecessor of the iPad come up with similar functionality? Not later than 1989:</font></font><br>

The </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GridPad wearable was</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> clearly released sooner than needed. Nevertheless, it implements the basic requirements for the tablet: a portable device, a touch screen, and the lack of a keyboard. In 1990, GridPad even got a built-in hard drive of 20 megabytes (and screen backlight). They say that they managed to sell as many as ten thousand pieces.</font></font><br>

Fast forward three years and look at the first attempt to create a commercial device with a full graphical interface. The video on the Lazy Game Reviews channel shows something cosmic for that era: a tablet with a wireless pen, on Windows 3.x and with a 386 processor inside. </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ideally!</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . The technology of modern tablets is being developed on slightly more compact devices: Palm and Apple Newton handheld computers, and later on PDAs running Windows Mobile. In any case, in the nineties, at a time when a typical computer was strictly stationary, all this was inaccessible to the masses. Due to the high price and the lack of really useful applications. Buying an ordinary laptop would be a blessing.</font></font><br>

Microsoft made its second trip to the country of touch devices in 2001, with the release of a special version of Windows XP and the announcement of an entire program for the release of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tablet PCs</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . In the noughts, the ‚Äútablet‚Äù is associated precisely with devices such as the ThinkPad X61 Tablet hybrid in the picture above. A laptop with a swivel screen, with a flick of the wrist turning into a tablet. An interesting device, but incorrigibly heavy and expensive. Management only with a pen, capacitive screens will appear in the latest devices. ‚ÄúLaptops without a keyboard‚Äù are moderately successful in corporations where forms and other body movements are required on the go. By the end of the decade, completely original specimens appear:</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cg/g7/g9/cgg7g9hwcdftmfnezfolbs9zd8k.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the 2007 Sony VAIO UX series, very compact models appear. 600 grams, 4.5-inch screen, retractable keyboard, Intel Core Solo processor and full Windows XP. Notebook makers experimented massively with the Tablet PC, trying to find a promising market niche, but, among other shortcomings, all these devices were notable for their high price. They were sold sluggishly; devices like the Sony UX280 are now expensive rarities. The price problem was solved by a category of devices that were not related to tablets, netbooks.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-w/pz/xr/-wpzxrvctzdu_8ty1yiqnha-hry.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2007, the outstanding Asus Eee PC 701 model was released: a cheap, compact laptop with a microscopic screen. One advantage: price, $ 190 per version with Linux. Later, normal Windows netbooks will appear, such as the Eee PC 900 model in the photo above. Price, depending on configuration, from 400 to 600 dollars. Before that, there were almost no laptops with such a price tag, and certainly there were no cheap compact devices weighing up to two kilograms. Netbooks are available, limited in capabilities due to Intel Atom processors, but they run on battery power for a long time (up to 10 hours with a large battery), and are quite suitable for basic network entertainment. Watch a movie, chat in newly appeared social networks. The Internet does not yet require the resources of an average supercomputer from the late nineties; web pages do not weigh 20 megabytes each. You can do with a netbook.</font></font><br>

The first Apple iPad attacks netbooks. In his favorite style, Steve Jobs announces that netbooks "are not really capable of anything," and he, of course, is not quite right. It shows a device that in a number of tasks is much more convenient, and this is true. Ten-inch screen with a resolution of 1024x768. Single-core Apple A4 processor, similar to that used in the iPhone 4 of 2010 (but slightly higher frequency - 1 GHz). 256 megabytes of RAM and a data storage of 16-64 gigabytes. The price of the base model is $ 500, and it is the price that becomes the main topic of the presentation.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/0i/zt/mb0iztbwpyi4kztvp3hl1fc0ulc.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But it is not only an affordable price. Apple gives iPad owners their own iWork office suite for free. Announces software from other developers, imprisoned for a large screen tablet. For the first time in a cheap device, such an ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù technology is implemented as an IPS screen with wide viewing angles. For the first time, 10 hours of battery life are achieved without the help of a thick battery. Apple is not required to provide backward compatibility with PC software, as in Windows XP and Windows 7, the interface of the system and all programs is initially compatible with finger control, it does not require a stylus. Yes, in many respects the success of the iPad is based on solutions previously tested on the iPhone. Even such a funny picture appears:</font></font><br>

Apple is often tried to criticize for the alleged lack of innovation: after all, everything has already been done before them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Both touch screens and compact devices for work on the go. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps, but the iPad definitely corrected several serious problems in the predecessor devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apple showed how to make such a device truly compact, lightweight, convenient to use, and long lasting on battery power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All that was needed was to get rid of the harsh legacy, to make a "phone with a large screen." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Okay, but why didn‚Äôt anyone think of this before?</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experiments with an ancient tablet</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I did not buy the original iPad. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead, he acquired an iPad 2, a 2011 model. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By and large, in this version, we fixed some flaws in the original (like a convex back cover), added more powerful iron, but in general this is still a characteristic early tablet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were two more reasons to buy this particular model. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Firstly, it is built on the Apple A5. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a dual-core processor on the ARM architecture, which provides a chance of at least some kind of performance in 2020. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, it was this device that became my first tablet and the first Apple device nine years ago.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cc/ys/uf/ccysufk_ww0ip21wzasm2vqnpw0.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The picture above is from the MVideo website from the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://web.archive.org/web/20111024073900/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">web archive</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , the price for the base model with 16 gigabytes of memory is also shown there: 19990 rubles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They bought one.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fv/g9/w-/fvg9w-gi3vyheit9i6j6anqajac.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2020, I have been choosing a retroplate in good condition for quite some time. I‚Äôm buying a ‚Äútopek‚Äù, iPad 2 with 64 gigabytes and 3G. Cellular communication in the tablet is a desirable, but not mandatory feature, now rather unnecessary, it is easier to distribute the Internet from a smartphone. The device cost 6,000 rubles, and this is not a very profitable purchase: a more powerful iPad 4 will cost a little more, and you can buy a very current iPad 5 for 10-15.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0o/k4/2n/0ok42npercee07tex2ahbmokfjm.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The tablet was used very carefully, it looks like new. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even the cable for the current 30-pin Apple connector is intact. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The latest version of iOS 9.3.5 available for this model is installed on the device, this is 2016. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Second iPad has been sold for quite some time as a cheap alternative to more modern Apple tablets, and received OS updates for five years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The original version of iOS is 4.3, and with the transition to iOS 7 we lost that warm-tube skeuomorphic interface that was typical of early Apple devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was:</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e6efa567/39ce7738/572983e4/abb90f83.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It became:</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A look from the present</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2020, the age of the device is already felt. It seems like it was recently a novelty, but now it is heavy, and the usual resolution screen (not Retina) is unusual: you can see individual pixels, how so? The speaker, although loud, is one, but we are used to decent stereo sound. Most importantly, the iPad is a device firmly tied to network services. They are constantly evolving, and the old device with the ancient processor gradually ceases to cope with them. The result is a twofold situation: the iOS interface ‚Äúflies‚Äù as usual. The App Store is slowing down. Safari browser frankly slows down and does not display some sites.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f9/5r/t2/f95rt2iar9qwdkzf75kk_668sy8.png"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The iOS app ecosystem has moved to 64-bit architecture since 2015. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But even without this, not all developers have the strength, time and desire to support old devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because of this, a lot of applications on the iPad 2 even with the OS five years ago give an error, as in the screenshot above. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs a little harder to deal with than with Android, and you can identify three stages of retro apple fanboy suffering:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The application is supported on the old device without problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You're lucky! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An example for iPad 2 and iOS 9.3 at the time of publication is the Telegram messenger.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The application is not supported on the old device. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When installing, an error occurs, as in the picture above. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But there is a life hack: if you have already downloaded the program earlier, in your ‚Äúpurchases‚Äù you can download the old (latest compatible) version. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alternative: download the application from the computer via iTunes.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/li/e9/wb/lie9wbx392edaj71oip6xydewhi.png"></div></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The application is not supported, before you did not buy or download it, and nothing works at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, you need a jailbreak and search for the old version of the app that will work.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7x/gi/e-/7xgie-ka9dwu9kjiqrd4py47xoi.jpeg"></div> </li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have not yet reached the third stage, since the archive of my previously used applications is large, and I managed to get almost everything I needed from there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The presence of such a compatibility layer is a great advantage of Apple from the point of view of the lover of antiquity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, on Android, the problem is solved by copying the APK of the desired version, easily and simply. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The iPad was also criticized for the platform‚Äôs closeness: adapters for cameras and memory cards were already being released, but this did not reach the functionality of Android (and especially laptops on Windows). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among older applications - a fully working Google Chrome browser version 63 (2017) and a working YouTube client.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A look from the past</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2011, there were no such problems: iPad 2 matched the capabilities of the then web. He actually bought for his wife, but as a result, we could not share it. Later I purchased my own tablet - Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet, a review of which I </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">published</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on Habr√©. It says that "I did not regret the purchase," and this is indeed so. But compared to the iPad, there was a noticeable difference in approaches. Early Android tablets could not offer a comparable set of compatible software (and some popular applications are not optimized for the big screen even now!), And the quality of the hastily released </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Android 3 Honeycomb</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">left much to be desired. Manufacturers of Android tablets tried to compete in features, but often they got a device the size of a laptop (keyboard, USB ports, HDMI output, memory cards!), At the price of a laptop, but without performance and compatibility with software. With the release of Android 4, a universal OS for smartphones and tablets, the situation began to improve, and there was no longer such a big difference between the platforms.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qx/yc/eo/qxyceo1uzrz7urbbzbe3lont8rw.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Competition is not as important as the experience of the first acquaintance with a ten-inch touchscreen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared to the rather compact smartphones of those times, the iPad / iPad 2 screen seemed simply luxurious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was much more convenient to browse websites. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The virtual keyboard on the large display was much more practical, not for typing in large volumes, but for communicating in instant messengers and social networks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Until now, it‚Äôs more convenient to view scanned documents and magazines on a tablet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most of the time, however, was spent on games. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Angry Birds:</font></font><br>

Plants vs Zombies:</font></font><br>

The mobile gaming industry has not yet been overtaken by a wave of free to play. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same "plants against zombies" or "birds" were sold for money, but they did not bother with advertising in the process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I restored the forgotten games on the iPad 2 without any problems in 2020, and it seems that this will be its main purpose: a moderately outdated gaming tablet.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Takeoff and gloom</font></font></h4><br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/eg/nb/wkegnb2agzjc0gnfclh5cfcxzr4.png"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Apple iPad has seriously influenced the personal device market. Netbooks disappeared from the horizon: the Lenovo S10 netbook purchased shortly before the iPad 2 was quickly sold - it was no longer needed. Android device vendors have seriously invested in the development of their own tablets. The whole Windows 8 desktop operating system tried to impose a ‚Äúfinger-oriented‚Äù interface, even where there was never a touch screen. This attempt to transfer everyone to the touchscreen did not last long. For Apple, 2014 was the most successful year in terms of iPad sales. After that, a slow decline in supply began, as can be seen in the general statistics above ( </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">from here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ).</font></font><br>

How did it happen? Along with the release of the iPad began a craze for smartphones with a large diagonal. The smartphone was set by the Samsung </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Galaxy Note</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> smartphone </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">with a huge (at that time) 5.3-inch screen. The modern Galaxy Note 10+ has a diagonal of 6.8 inches. Compared to 10 inches of the original iPad, this is not such a big difference to justify the purchase of another device. The tablets of the beginning of zero proved to be excellent as devices for consuming content, in other words, for procrastination. Social networks, videos, games and more - all this is available on a smartphone without any problems. Why then buy another device?</font></font><br>

As a result, the tablets returned to where they were in 2007: into the niche of specialized devices, for those who need a large touch screen. Cheap universal iPads are still being sold and updated, but since 2015 a model with a 13-inch display has been released, which is trying to compete more with full-fledged laptops. Both in price and in performance. iPad Pro 2020 is positioned as a laptop computer. This is a great tablet for artists, a suitable portable device for processing photos, with a keyboard - a good machine for working with documents. But it costs accordingly: up to $ 1800 in a top-end configuration with terabyte storage.</font></font><br>

The initially minimalist iPad wasn‚Äôt just brought back the keyboard. The stylus reappeared, which Steve Jobs unsuccessfully tried to rid us of in 2007. By features, price and performance, the iPad Pro is just an alternative to a laptop. Unseen previously possible features are added to the software - mouse support, multi-window mode. A tablet is not always the best choice, including for me: I have old devices on Android and iOS, but no new ones. For a keyboard worker, a classic laptop is more comfortable. iPad is evolving and again trying to find its niche, once having been a universal device for everyone. But these bright times are in the past.</font></font><br>

In my collection, the iPad 2 was in the middle between older devices and modern ones. On Windows Mobile and Symbian zero software stores do not work, network services are disabled. On the iPad 2, everything works, but not all applications are available, and the tablet simply can not cope with most of the relevant ones. Requirements for iron increased, and disproportionately to the number of new features. Old, often no longer updated software, works, and it turns out that I bought the old iPad on time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It‚Äôs not a fact that in the future access to even the application store will continue, support for the web may completely fall off. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And installed applications will work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is definitely a new category of devices in my collection: they are tied to network services so that they are best configured in advance and put on a shelf. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As these services develop, it may turn out that there is a piece of iron, but nothing can be done with it, if you do not take into account jailbreak and other entertainment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Better to build a set of vintage software now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then it may be too late.</font></font></div>
