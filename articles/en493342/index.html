      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/company/nspk/blog/493342/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well-known events didn’t pass us by either - on March 16, most of the team of the National Payment Card System (NSPK) - about a thousand employees - switched to remote work. Of course, for any large company, such a transition is a very big challenge, and you probably already read a lot of cases on this topic. But many companies can afford to take at least a short break to rebuild. But how can this be done by the operational processing and clearing center (OPCC) of all domestic Russian interbank operations, which processes tens of millions of transactions per day and, of course, cannot stop for a moment? What to do first? How to solve issues with equipment and workflow tuning for various departments? As a result, we transferred most of the employees to remote work,not for a second stopping the processes in the CPCC - and now we will tell you how.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to transfer to a remote site 1000 people in less than a week</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We began to prepare for the transition to udalenka on Wednesday, March 11. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then we understood that the probability of a scenario in which employees would have to work from home was high, but we assumed that we had at least a week. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, everything turned out differently, and already on Monday, March 16, most of the employees began to work remotely.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Those left on the office who depend on the adoption of operational decisions and on-call services, for example, in the CPCC, who, in principle, work at any time of the year, monitoring the uninterrupted processing of all operations. But for the CPMC, we have monitoring systems that allow us to control processes and ensure that everything is going as usual. Therefore, all transaction processing processes are going in a completely regular mode, and unprincipled, a thousand people are in the office or ten. For those who remain in the office, the company purchased "advanced" medical masks, constantly treats all surfaces and takes other preventive measures.</font></font><br>
<br>

«  1000 ,   ,        150 .   150  –       –      , ..     –    .  ,         600 ».</blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a short time, our team had to solve several key issues, and the first of them was whether our external channels and equipment would withstand such a load? Indeed, in normal times, the bulk of the data is closed to the internal office network, and with remote operation of the communication channels, the office network would most likely not be enough. In total, we have four such channels from different operators, and in normal mode the expansion process takes 2-3 weeks. Under current conditions, we expanded the first channel even before the decision to switch to udalenka, on Friday, the rest on Tuesday.</font></font><br>
<br>

</blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But what to do with the rest? We had a stock of laptops in stock for the planned expansion of the staff, but they had to be prepared from scratch - put Windows, software, VPN client. We managed to automate this process, and no difficulties arose - we only needed two pairs of hands that brought the equipment from the warehouse, unpacked it, poured the software and gave it to the requestor. Unfortunately, a small shortage of laptops arose. Good relations with suppliers and manufacturers of equipment helped, and in just a day and a half, we found contractors who had a stock of laptops in stock.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
“I would like to thank our suppliers and partners - without their help all these changes would be difficult to implement so quickly and effectively. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the current conditions, we worked with them “honestly”, sometimes bypassing the regulations and without the necessary papers - and it's cool that our colleagues trust us. ”</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now, by the end of the week, most of the technical and operational issues have been resolved and put on stream; tuning is underway. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Olga Maslennikova</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
“For our part, we are trying to optimize the processes on the go. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, some groups of employees who require complex technical access had to file three applications each. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We quickly oriented ourselves and implemented a comprehensive service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Things went faster. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“I myself am amazed at how quickly we react and how ready I am for any surprises.”</font></font><br>
</blockquote><br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learning to work from home</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The challenge now is, rather, to teach people who are not used to working remotely, to build processes in the current realities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is greatly helped by colleagues from HR and internal communications, who quickly share all the necessary information, and the company's management, who promptly decides that business processes do not stop even in such conditions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was necessary to explain to people from non-IT departments how, in principle, to live at a distance, what is VPN and RDP. Given a fairly large number of organizational and technical measures related to ensuring information security, this is very difficult. We made instructions, strengthened support on the phone - and as a result, in two days, we taught colleagues to use tools that they did not use while in the office. For example, Skype for Business was preinstalled on all computers on our computers - and many found out about it only on the day when they announced the decision on remote work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today, working meetings, including various committees, operational meetings, and top-management speeches, are held on Skype or other channels. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, we also have a chat bot in Telegram, through which we usually solve small IT and household issues in the office - yesterday we launched a new update in the prod that will help us quickly and without involving employees solve problems related to the remote site.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/qs/e3/faqse3hmewishj8vli8ay-tzj-e.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yuri Mishchenko</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
“As a result, in a couple of days, employees learned to work remotely fully functional. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I’m sure that after the completion of the story of self-isolation and return to the office, the landscape of office work will change, and approaches to organizing work too - there are different cases, and the company should continue to work. ”</font></font><br>
