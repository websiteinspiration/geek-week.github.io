Today we will talk about how the barcode has evolved (and continues to evolve) from a linear black-and-white pattern to a multidimensional design.</font></font><br>

<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Like most inventions, the first generation of barcodes - a linear one-dimensional bar code - appeared when there was an urgent need to automate a fairly simple, but routine and painstaking job of sorting and recording goods in the process of logistics and sales: what goes into the warehouse, what leaves the warehouse what is shipped to customers and in what assortment. When all these processes are inevitably accompanied by manual filling of the necessary documents, finding the right shelves in the warehouse, generating reporting on logistics, it takes a significant amount of time for the employee. In addition, errors when manually filling out documents are inevitable. The growth in turnover required a cardinal solution that would quickly and without errors solve the problems of control and accounting.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcoding goods appeared simultaneously with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing the work of an ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ideal supermarket</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äù, Developed by a student at Harvard Business School, Wallace Flint in the early 1930s. The proposed technical solution suggested that the buyer independently creates a list of purchases in the warehouse, making punctures in a special punch card of the buyer. At the checkout, this punch card was supposed to be read by a special device, the goods were delivered using a special conveyor, and the service process was quick for both the buyer and seller. The main problem was that at that time there were practically no technologies and equipment for servicing such processes: the computer that would be required to organize the reading and processing of information of this class would be too cumbersome and expensive.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The following approach to coding the product range was taken in 1948, when graduate student enthusiasts from the Drexel Institute of Technology (USA) began developing a technology for collecting analytical information on purchases directly at the cash desks in supermarkets based on labeling of goods. Then a group of researchers created a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù technology of optical soundtrack and Morse code. In the classical technology of an optical sound track, a coating with an uneven density is applied along the edge of the film. This unevenness leads to the fact that the intensity of the beam of the projector passing through it also changes. These fluctuations in brightness are converted to sound.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Researchers transformed points and dashes of Morse code into uneven bands, as if ‚Äústretching‚Äù them down. The result is a sequence of wide vertical lines (dashes) and narrow lines (dots), separated by spaces. Reading the combinations of dark lines and light spaces and interpreting the reflected rays proved to be a workable idea, which was subsequently </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">granted a patent</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For the first time in practice, the barcode was used by a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Engineering, when he started working at the railway station and was involved in simple but routine sorting of wagons, which also required constant observance of the accuracy of operations and avoiding errors in entering data into registration papers. For each car, it is necessary to find out its number, check with the accompanying documents, clarify the route, determine the place in the train, and so on. This procedure was quite lengthy, time-consuming and required stopping the composition.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the middle of the 20th century, technology had already stepped forward, and there was the possibility of automatically reading out sufficiently large numbers of cars using photocells. But reading the number in the form of Arabic numerals is a fairly simple task for a person who knows how the numbers look and what they mean. For a machine, numbers are a sequence of lines located at a certain angle. The absence of one or more lines or inaccurate application makes the task of digit recognition (in the absence of OCR technology) poorly realizable. Therefore, it was proposed to simplify machine recognition to record numbers not only with ordinary Arabic ‚Äúhuman-readable‚Äù numbers, but also with a code in the form of wide stripes of blue and red.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This code was placed directly on board the car and made it large enough so that the photocell could snatch out and correctly recognize the bar code illuminated by the spotlight on the passing scanner of the car. Tests have confirmed the effectiveness of the recognition system at speeds up to 100 km / h. It was already a perfectly working technology that completely changed a single process in an entire industry.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Later, with the improvement of technology, the projector was replaced by a laser, which not only consumed less energy than a powerful incandescent lamp, but also made it possible to make the applied barcodes much smaller in size, and the scanning unit itself was much more compact until the creation of handheld and desktop scanners . The development of laser scanning technologies and compactization has become a step towards the widespread use of barcodes as a universal means of marking goods, not only in railway transport.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the late 60s, the United States began developing a universal numbering system for goods as a means of identification. The bar coding system, which began to be used in trade, was developed in 1972 and was called UPC - Universal Product Code. The barcodes of this system began to be assigned to all types of goods produced and registered in the USA and Canada. The organization of the same name began active propaganda and the introduction of the use of barcodes in industry and commerce. The first historical retail UPC barcode reading took place at an American supermarket in 1974.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since 1977, in Western Europe, a similar American system called the European Article Numbering (EAN) has been used to identify consumer goods. Today it is this association that is engaged in the distribution of barcodes for manufacturers of goods. To avoid duplication of numbers, barcodes for goods are issued centrally by the international association, which includes 98 organizations from 100 countries. The manufacturer can get a barcode for his product by registering with this association.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The barcodes of the UPC and EAN families operate with a fairly small alphabet that allows you to encode a fairly limited amount of information. The UPC used in the USA consists of 12 characters, the EAN of 13 digits and is a slightly advanced modification of the UPC code. Coding characters are vertical stripes of varying widths and spaces between them. In standard linear codes, information about the country of origin of the goods, the manufacturing organization, and the product code itself is encrypted. To verify the correctness of the code, a check digit and a special sign are placed at the end, indicating that the goods are manufactured under license.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5u/a6/vi/5ua6vijz-_0tlxiy_s486r5nzew.png"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now let's look at the code in terms of structure and coding principles. Here we will analyze in detail only one - standardized - UPC-A type barcode to show: the coding principles that are applied are much more complicated than they seem at first glance. This complexity ensures error-free recognition by minimizing the risk of misreading.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bn/i-/-j/bni--jg-fx2cjjbxwlzaa_z7nhg.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The barcode type UPC-A code is divided into 2 equal parts and is displayed as dark (strokes) and light (spaces) stripes that encode the 12-digit UPC-A number. Each digit is a unique set of 2 strokes and 2 spaces of variable width in 1, 2, 3 or 4 modules (in this case, the minimum discrete bandwidth). At the same time, the total width of the coding bands for each digit remains unchanged - 7 modules. Thus, the content of the product code UPC-A is encoded in 84 units.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many wondered why on different barcodes the same numbers can be in several different ways (some even built conspiracy theories on this subject). The fact is that the barcode coding algorithm is not entirely linear. In the right and left parts of the code, the numbers are encoded differently: the alternation of strokes and spaces in the numbers occurs in three sets of sequences (A, B and C). In sequence A, there are always an odd number of dark modules, in sets B and C it is even. In this case, set B - is an inverse of set a (strokes are replaced by spaces and vice versa), and set C is a mirror image of set B. Signs of a symbol in numerical sets A and B always begin on the left with a light module and end on the right with a dark module, and in a numerical set C start on the left with a dark module and end on the right with a light module.On the left side, when encoding numbers, sets A or B are used, depending on the position of the numbers in the code, the right side is encoded by set C. The encoding algorithms are described in detail in the standards. For example, in</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this one</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to the bands encoding information, the graphic code contains restrictive patterns of the beginning of the code, the end of the code, and the middle. The end patterns have the form bar-space-bar-stroke, and the central one - space-bar-space-bar-stroke. The presence of restrictive patterns, as well as a ‚Äúquiet zone‚Äù around the barcode, allows the reader to more accurately determine the boundaries of the barcode, thereby increasing the speed and accuracy of recognition. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Barcode formats are constantly being improved and changed. Today, in addition to the standard Universal Product Code and European Article Numbering accepted in international trade, there are more than 300 standards for bar coding. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since 2005, an international standard has been adopted, which uses three main types of coding of product information:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">EAN-8 (abbreviated) - 8 digits encoded.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">EAN-13 (full) - 13 digits are encoded (12 significant + 1 checksum).</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">EAN-128 - allows you to encode any number of letters and numbers combined into regulated groups. </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unlike EAN-8 and EAN-13, the code EAN-128 (GS1-128) is used by manufacturers, carriers and trading companies to exchange data on the transported goods. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This longer code may contain extended information, such as waybill numbers, destination indexes, volumes of goods transported, product codes and serial numbers of products, expiration dates, etc. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main advantage of a bar code is its simplicity, functionality and noise immunity . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main drawback is the relatively small amount of information that can be encoded with it.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Era 2-D</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the development of information processing technologies, one-dimensional (linear) barcodes have been replaced by two-dimensional ones. If strokes are used in linear (one-dimensional) codes, then in other two-dimensional (and multidimensional) codes other figures can act as coding elements, therefore, in order to differentiate one from another, here we will call multidimensional codes as barcodes. Research and development of two-dimensional codes began in many countries around the world in the 1980s, since the amount of information encoded in linear codes was clearly insufficient. Their appearance became a natural evolution of coding systems, and at the same time recognition technologies, software and hardware capabilities of recognition systems.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, there was a need to mark literally everything with codes: not only, for example, assembly units, but also individual parts. Therefore, there was a need to miniaturize the code and increase the density of the encoded information per unit area. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a two-dimensional code, as the name implies, encoding occurs not in one direction, but in two. Indeed, if you place several one-dimensional codes in the form of alternating fragments, you get the simplest two-dimensional code of the Stacked Linear type (composite linear). If we ‚Äúpack‚Äù the modules into a square, we get a matrix barcode (Matrix). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An example of a composite linear barcode - PDF417, which appeared in 1991 and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">patented</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in 1993. The PDF417 code consists of lines formed by ‚Äúwords‚Äù - a set of alternating strokes and spaces (4 lines, 4 spaces - the first number from the code name). The total length of each word is 17 modules (the second number in the code name).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to the actual meaningful words, each line consists of a start pattern (leftmost set, keywords (indicators - they occupy the extreme positions on the line), necessary for error correction, and a stop pattern (However, there is also the so-called ‚Äútruncated PDF417 ‚Äù(Truncated), where the right-line indicator is turned off and the stop pattern is reduced to one line. Thus, truncated PDF417 take up less space, but they are more susceptible to incorrect reading. This version of PDF417 is used only where the risk of damage to the code image is minimal). Since all words have the same length, the columns placed one under the other form columns. In the PDF417 code, both the number of lines and the number of columns can vary: the code can contain from 3 to 90 lines, and have a width of 3 to 30 columns inclusive,not counting columns with words indicators. A detailed article about encoding PDF417 recently appeared on Habr√©</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but about the possibility of its ‚Äúmanual‚Äù decoding - </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dn/jc/3b/dnjc3bm1mjl52qvurvwiki0tgr8.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The peculiarity of the PDF417 code is the ability to encode information in text mode, numerical mode and data mode (byte mode). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since the amount of encoded information has increased in PDF417, error correction mechanisms have been used to correctly read and decode it in the code. This is achieved by adding keywords with which the machine can recover data that has been lost or read with an error. The ability to correct errors is a key advantage of PDF417: if recognized, the recognition device will not be afraid of possible distortions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Like its predecessor, a linear barcode, PDF417 was created at a time when mobile phones were a little smaller than a suitcase, and perhaps they didn‚Äôt even think about the built-in cameras. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, its use implied the presence of specialized scanners designed to read such code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This explains the complexity of this barcode and the increased print resolution requirements. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
PDF417 barcodes are widely used for marking medical products, are applied to documents in electronic document management systems, and are used on tax return and travel forms.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Code in the matrix</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The matrix structure allows you to encode information both vertically and horizontally, due to which the amount of encoded data increases significantly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An important advantage of all matrix codes is the ability to encode a large amount of information over a very small area.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Data Matrix Code </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Data Matrix code was invented by International Data Matrix in the mid-1980s for the Space Shuttle program, which required marking a large number of parts. Data Matrix was developed before PDF417, i.e. PDF417 could not precede Data Matrix, as indicated in some sources. An important advantage of the code is its compactness and ease of application. The Data Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcurrently described by the relevant ISO standards. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ql/dk/nr/qldknr64rjsqukie0kydc6x9kyi.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
DataMatrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa two-dimensional barcode that can store up to 3116 digits and up to 2335 letters. The information in the Data Matrix barcode is encoded in black and white squares (modules) with a minimum linear module size of 0.255 mm.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The search pattern in the form of the letter ‚ÄúL‚Äù is two solid lines on the outside of the Data Matrix code. This pattern allows the barcode scanner to set the image in the correct orientation and read the information in the correct order. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second important pattern necessary for the machine to understand the code is the clocking pattern (clock track). It is necessary to inform the reading system about the number of modules in the matrix and to correctly recognize the grid on which the modules are located. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A quiet zone is an area that separates the border of a barcode from the background and other images. For Data Matrix, the width of the ‚Äúsilence zone‚Äù is equal to the linear size of the module used. Small dimensions for the silence zone minimize the surface area for applying Data Matrix.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The specificity of the Data Matrix allows you to read it both in direct and reflected light (that is, when using an inverted image in which light modules become dark). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another advantage of the Data Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthat square modules can be replaced with round ones. This further expands the possibilities of using various application technologies, for example, in the form of embossing or impact engraving. However, the same technology for replacing a square module with a round one was also adopted in other types of codes, for example, in a QR code.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The standardized Data Matrix code is today regarded as a key link in the identification and labeling of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Starting July 1, 2020, Data Matrix labeling will become mandatory for all drugs in circulation in Russia. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The detailed process for creating a Data Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãdescribed </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AZTEC Code</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The barcode type Aztec appeared in 1995, as they say, as a result of combining the best practices for the development of barcodes of previous generations. The look and structure of Aztec code is designed in such a way that it is equally convenient for application and reading. The symbols are generally square on a square grid with a square central ‚Äúsight‚Äù of concentric dark and light squares of the ‚Äúapple‚Äù type of the target (the term ‚Äúbull's eye‚Äù is used in English descriptions). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The smallest Aztec Code character has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã15 x 15 modules, and the largest is 151 x 151. The smallest Aztec Code character encodes 13 numeric or 12 letter characters, while the largest Aztec Code character encodes 3832 numeric or 3067 alphanumeric characters.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">QR code</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We got to the most, perhaps, the most common codes that we meet at every step. </font></font><br>

QR code is another kind of matrix code. Its name comes from the English ‚ÄúQuick Response‚Äù - ‚ÄúQuick Response‚Äù. It was created by Denso-Wave in 1994 in Japan for the domestic market (the difference between a QR code and other two-dimensional barcodes is that this code allows you to encode the characters of Japanese (or rather, coming from China to Japan) kanji letters. Also in the QR code redundant information may be laid in that allows you to encode certain actions for a smartphone program or scanner to read in. The </font></font><br>

principles of encoding a QR code are described in sufficient detail and can be easily found. The algorithm for reading a bar code not with a scanner, but with your eyes, you can read it, for example </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In such a QR code, you can easily encode the address of the web page that will open when you hover a mobile phone on it: </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this QR code contains not only the address of the web page, but also the phone number, email address, mailing address. To create a contact card, just point your mobile phone to the QR code, and the information will be automatically recognized, and the data will be entered into the system. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Moreover, even the presence of the logo of our company, covering about 10% of the code, does not interfere with correctly recognizing all encoded information. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Below is an example of the largest-dimensional QR code that can encode up to 1852 characters.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The listed barcodes allow you to encode digital and text data with approximately the same efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the comparison provided on the RIT service site specializing in barcode processing, the QR code allows you to encode large amounts of digital data in a smaller area with the same module size compared to Aztec and Data Matrix, encode large amounts of digital data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Data Matrix code is inferior to the QR code when encoding more than 88 digits, Aztec is inferior to the QR code when encoding more than 170 digits. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in terms of coding efficiency, the QR code is significantly inferior to Aztec, and the Data Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsuperior only with a text volume of more than 298 characters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, when coding the text typed in capital (capital) letters of efficiency, the QR code and Aztec are close, and the Data Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinferior to the QR code when encoding 88 letters.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What unites all these codes?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important for the machine to understand that in front of it is the code where its ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù and ‚Äúend‚Äù are located. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this, ‚Äúzones of silence‚Äù, special border patterns and ‚Äúsights‚Äù are used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the machine needs to understand in what format the data is written, that is, how to decode - in the form of numbers, alphanumeric text, or in the data format. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The machine should also be able to correct errors so that the accidental loss of several pixels of a barcode image does not lead to its complete unreadability. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Error correction in DataMatrix, Aztec, QR codes is carried out using </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reed-Solomon</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> codes </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, which correct reading errors and allow data to be recognized even in highly ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù codes (up to 30% of the surface).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do we need barcodes?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Barcodes have become so commonplace that we don‚Äôt even think about why they are needed and what function they perform. And in fact, the answer is not as obvious as it seems. It is important to understand that barcode refers to automation, that is, it provides communication between the machine and the person. The barcode itself is not a working tool, but is of value only if there is a high-quality system of barcode recognition and interpretation of the results. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The introduction of a barcode recognition system in business processes allows you to speed up the search, insertion and extraction of information from databases, improve logistics control, and make interaction with customers more comfortable.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The introduction of barcodes in medical records and the introduction of recognition systems in medical institutions increases the speed of patient care and makes the registry </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
more systematic and streamlined. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Implemented barcodes on tickets accelerate the passage through checkpoints and turnstiles, making contactless ticket verification a more convenient solution than physical verification by a controller. In this case, the barcode serves as an element of protection against counterfeiting, just like the implemented barcodes on secure printing products and strict reporting documents.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The process of making payments has been greatly simplified with the introduction of barcodes on utility bills, fines, taxes and other social payments. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All details are encrypted and for making a payment in a banking application it is enough to point a mobile phone to the barcode, and the application with the barcode recognition module will independently enter all the details of the recipient in the required fields.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the problem and problems of barcode recognition?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Each barcode must be recognized. If it cannot be recognized, then from a barcode it turns into an unrecognizable artistic ornament. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Three main tasks that need to be solved when recognizing a barcode are its detection, localization, detection of the bit matrix and recognition. Each problem can be prevented by various problems that arise due to damage to the barcode carrier itself or to deficiencies in software and hardware solutions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The detection and localization of the barcode is hindered by various projective and non-linear distortions, poor lighting, glare, and application errors. The level of distortion depends on how the barcode is created, and on the device and software with which this barcode is read. The original message is encoded in a bit matrix (of ones and zeros) according to special rules (each symbolology has its own), which is somehow applied to the medium. When applied, the unit usually corresponds to a dark module, and zero to light. The problem is that it is not enough just to localize the boundaries of the code on the media, you need to restore the original bit matrix from the image. And this is accompanied by a number of difficulties, which leads to the presence of a special stage in reading codes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As mentioned above, each barcode has its own degree of error correction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even a heavily worn barcode with a high degree of error correction can be correctly read by the system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at the same time, the system itself, when scanning barcodes, must distinguish a grain of sand adhering to the barcode from an informationally significant element. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same way, when reading, the system must accurately determine the boundaries of the barcode, eliminate possible distortions caused by slopes, distortions, and optical deformation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is especially true for two-dimensional ones that carry a significant amount of information. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An important quality of the barcode recognition system is the ability to quickly and accurately recognize them at different angles, in poor lighting, vibration, shaking, with a partially covered field, in the presence of glare and spots on surfaces.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What's next?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Where there are two dimensions, there are 3 and 4. In mid-2006, the Japanese company ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Content Idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãASIA</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù proudly announced that they had invented the first 3D code in history. In the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PM code</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (from ‚Äúpaper memory‚Äù), color was added to the two-dimensional QR code as a third dimension. Adding color components, as </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">stated</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">inventor Tatsui Onoda, if in a black and white two-dimensional QR code you can encrypt 3 kb of information, then in three-dimensional - up to 720 (that is, 240 times more). Instead of linking to an image, using the topology of the 3D color code, you can encrypt the entire image, as well as small video and audio fragments. The technology has received patents in Japan and Europe. Apparently, the project developed until 2013, and at the moment is frozen or closed. The site of the Japanese inventor company has not been updated since 2013, and it is no longer possible to download the application in official application stores. (If you wish, you can download it from some mirrors on the network and see how it works on the samples posted on the developer's site). </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2010, Microsoft went further - announced the creation of a new concept of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">high-density color barcodes</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(High Capacity Color Barcode (HCCB)), where the code was already presented in the form of the same QR-like matrix, however, the code elements were not black square modules, but colored (4 or 8 colors) triangles, each of which occupied ‚Öî cells. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/du/zr/2d/duzr2dpbq0oshc6jvxs4u4gbquu.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The HCCB project also existed until 2013: then Microsoft </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">announced</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that the project would not be supported and was closed in 2015. Recently, there was </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">information</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on the </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">network </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that Apple was developing new types of codes that would be available in future versions of the OS. We are talking about round barcodes, where the information is encoded in the form of 4 color ‚Äúdrops‚Äù placed in the center and around the perimeter of the circle.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, studies of the possibility of creating and using color barcodes are still ongoing, but they are not yet widely used. The reason here is that with an increase in ‚Äúmeasurements‚Äù of the encoding and an increase in the amount of encoded information, the number of errors that need to be fixed also grows. The color code should contain a large redundancy necessary to correct errors that are caused not only by geometric, but also by chromatic distortions that occur during the display of a bar code on a medium (screen, paper or any other surface) and during reading. The higher the expected error rate, the greater redundancy should be in the code. And as a consequence, the density of the code decreases, which makes the process of its creation, reading and decoding economically impractical.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is logical to assume that following codes with three parameters, four-dimensional codes will follow, dynamically changing in time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the point of view of theory, these are very interesting problems that raise the question of the need for the simultaneous development of software that allows one to recognize such objects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here we come to the concept of 4D recognition, which we will talk about later.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As an afterword</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2013, a funny program for mobile phones Barcode KANOJO appeared, which decoded (or pretended to decode) the barcode in an unusual way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead of the embedded character set, a virtual girlfriend (kanojo) appeared on the mobile screen - an anime character - corresponding to the scanned code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One could be friends with her, gain trust (and love ???). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The project did not last long enough, the characters were not generated, and most likely they were simply selected from a certain set of data created in advance from an external data server, which is now unavailable.</font></font></div>
