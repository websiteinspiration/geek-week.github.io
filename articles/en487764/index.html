<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When I was seven, dad bought our first Arduino and we made a toy for cats. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The laser pointer was suspended on two servomotors and fired a beam - and the animals rushed behind the red dot around the room. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I began to dig into the program that my father wrote, trying to understand how everything works ... and so I tried C ++. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I quickly realized that the “pluses” for a first-grader were somehow not very good, but I was interested in programming, I sat down at Scratch - my dad advised him to teach it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When he outgrew it, his father showed a couple of tricks in Python. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then there was the classic way: I wanted to make a web page, I sat down for jQuery, JS frameworks and Node.js. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here I am)</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How I learned English by reading the documentation</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It all started with Arduino. I did not have normal documentation in Russian - but on the official website everything was in English. Of course, at school they gave us a basic foreign language, but a language teacher would hardly have helped much with technical texts. And the computer science teacher showed us how to draw in paint. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I armed myself with a Google translator, climbed on arduino.cc and learned to understand something, translating individual words.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A real breakthrough came when I mastered Scratch. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To participate in the life of the community, you really need to know English, because everyone communicates on it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People may accidentally stumble upon your project, give feedback or write: “Can I take this for myself?” </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such is the open source on the minimum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to the community, I stopped feeling embarrassed to answer questions and comment on something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, he broke the language barrier and began to use English for real, as a tool. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When I started experimenting with Python and JS, it was very useful: the ability to read and speak foreign can take you very far)</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My pet projects</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were over 50 of them, but I will talk about five. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first game.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> She became the first commit on the github - November 1, 2015. No plot: you control a ship (it simulates a triangle) and burst bubbles that are depicted as circles. Everything is drawn on the go. </font></font><br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first web page.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> First I made the homepage for my browser: there wasn’t even CSS, but the first attempt was successful, and I began to actively watch what else I could - I took different cookies and experimented with them. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Somehow, I raised the server using the Telnet protocol and began to make requests to Google web search through the terminal. </font></font></i><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I accidentally collected the Telnet's hanipot.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now telnet is mainly used for routers, and all sorts of cunning bots quickly climbed up to me. My server did not accept their commands, but simply logged everything. And it was very funny to look at this: a bot comes across a server, thinks it is a router, sends all kinds of commands in an attempt to reconfigure it - and the server just gives the results from Google. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The web version of Que is a democratic way to create a collective playlist. </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first time I got featured on Product Hunt.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the summer of 2018, I was flipping through the Apple documentation and saw that they have a web API for music. At school, we often had a problem - when we have a celebration or a party, everyone cuts hard for the right to turn on their music. I decided to create a service that will solve the problem: you open it on a computer or phone, those who want to scan the QR code, add their songs to the general playlist and vote for the one that will play next. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iz/ta/5y/izta5ylevryg8b-xxtw-9bzctzo.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">426 votes and third place according to the results of the day on the service. Now the project is closed, because Apple changed the API, and Facebook released its application - it’s stupid to butt it)</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
When I decided to put it on Product Hunt, it took 10 minutes: I sent an application, the dude wrote from the other side: “We feature you, but please rewrite the description. It is so-so. ” I said, “OK.”</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tm/lv/by/tmlvby1l512q709vxmtpufvuqbc.png"><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is Docket - a “tinder for making a shopping list”.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Another project that went to Product Hunt. The idea was this: here you are standing in front of an empty refrigerator, going to the store and trying to figure out what else to buy. At this moment, you can not break your brain, but start the application, look at the product cards and swipe them - the shopping list will be compiled automatically. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rn/zq/in/rnzqinbr7dndqytbhgdioxqboy4.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I picked up the idea and description on an English </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">site</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> with project ideas.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
To find the data for the application, I went to the fifth page of Google: only data sets with branded products came across above. And there, in the depths of the issue, a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">link to the github was waiting</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: someone posted a data set, where each line is a check in English with a list of products without brands (“milk”, “cucumbers”, etc.). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on it, I compiled my excel: a list of products and their popularity rating - that is, not some olives were shown first, but milk. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because it is needed more often. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The funniest thing happened when Product Hunt posted a link to this product on their social networks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Traffic went and someone wrote: “Listen, everything is great, but swap the swap, in Tinder it is the other way around.” </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I’m 13 years old, I don’t use this, how do I know which way the swipe is there ?! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Parents neighing.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did I get an internship</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My level of English was already higher than they could at school, and there was a desire to grow in this regard. My parents enrolled me in language courses: I went there until it became a pity to waste time on the road. Then I started practicing in Skyeng. I was not only an active student, but I also actively sent feedback on the platform. At one point, the company's products created a chat in a telegram and added people like me there.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I started using chat to send bug reports - not quite critical, but interesting. For example, when soft scrolling didn’t work on my iPad in Vimbox, our browser training platform, I wrote: “It seems that if I correct this piece of CSS, it will work.” That is, I did not just complain, but put forward my hypotheses about why this might be, I threw logs and details. At some point, Vlada, the head of products for children and teenagers, wrote to me and offered to try her hand at an internship in their team. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e2/l8/8d/e2l88dlgu4dhc9oec8r-scswzxi.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same message from Vlada with an offer to intern. By the way, they took me as a result without a test, although all adult developers pass it: they say it takes about an hour and a half.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I wrote: “Thank you, I’ll think about it.” Just didn't know how to react. And immediately went to his father: “Dad, what should I do?” After the story with Product Hunt, he already ceased to be surprised and said that, in principle, this was a good offer: remote, free schedule and great experience. Then there was a call - and they took me as an intern. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dad, of course, still had to collect documents: in Russia you can officially work from the age of 14, but for registration you need to stock up on time, undergo a medical examination and get approval from the district department of social protection. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bl/3i/sa/bl3isaoml_h21_26b5a7nw-yegq.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the guys are known for being remote, there is an office in Moscow. I drove there a couple of times. </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was assigned to the simple tasks department:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a dedicated team that offloads the core development. The department was heavily loaded with requests for landing pages, and many orders for creating bots for Slack piled up. Probably, then the guys sat down and thought: “We have a developer who can write in JS, but does not know PHP. You can write bots on JS, maybe we can give them to him? ” So I became one of the two people in Skyeng who write bots to automate the life of development and other departments.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For me, this was a good start: I could not take and put something important, and if something suddenly happened, the losses were minimal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such moments, of course, were: somehow I mixed up two SQL keywords - on a small test base, both worked in the same time, but in reality one required a lot more processor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the base of the real Skaeng dictionary is huge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when I sent a request to this database, he decently loaded it for a couple of minutes until the request was nailed)</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First tasks</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At first, my mentor was Lesha. </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">deusdeorum</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kataev, the then team lead of one of the key teams. When I was added to Slack, he wrote: “Hi, I want to automate our development processes,” and threw two ideas for bots. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/8y/hl/me8yhlauggoxzk948xhwtpf4gfw.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When there are a lot of correspondence, often tagging a person is not enough - the mention does not guarantee that he will read the message: it can be lost in a minute among others like that. I wrote a decision in a week)</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The first was the bot, which guaranteed the reading of important messages. We called him Yellbot. Used for critical cases: you select accounts or a group of accounts through Yellbot, and he begins to “chase” people with a specific message - updates the notification every minute until you click “I read” under the text. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I made a bot named Jake - it automates the techview.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previously, a team leader collected tickets, categorized them, put them on the team’s channel, asked the guys to vote for the tasks — all this took about an hour, it was expensive and dreary. The bot collects a list of tasks upon request, launches a vote on the channel, and issues a voting result. Now, when the tech review is being rolled out to many teams, it saves leads for whole man days. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/6c/ck/ss6cckeadamlk2pcagxg_qfzlqo.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And these are my cats = ^ ·. · ^ =</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Since then I have made dozens of bots: some were as stupid as possible (for example, one just welcomed a newcomer to the channel and asked to read the rules), some served as a search interface in the knowledge bases or helped automate analytics.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is very cool. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previously, when I laid out the solution on the same Product Hunt, it was in demand for two days, and then only a couple of people found it necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, when I create something, I know that I am doing something useful that months and even years may use.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to combine work with school</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now I am in the eighth grade of the 57th school. This year a special class in computer science opened here: several hundred children showed up, even from other schools and cities - the competition was open. I was very worried whether I would pass. To increase my chances, I asked Sasha Laryanovsky, Skyeng's managing partner, to write me a recommendation. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i_/8g/an/i_8gan12xg0wgytpztq6qtscobi.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think the internship is one of the reasons why I was taken to a special class. The letter of recommendation worked perfectly. </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have a lot of computer science:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on Monday - two hours, on Thursday - two more, on Saturday - six. And this is precisely an advanced course: we master the algorithms, write in C ++, we also have mathematical analysis (“I love” it with all my heart).</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cj/qx/cn/cjqxcnieys5mc94v3boqwil2suy.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And they also take us on excursions to various IT companies) From the class, not only am I seriously interested in development - another of the guys writes good games.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
And the school is seven to eight lessons on weekdays and nine on Saturday, so I do not work every day. And according to the law, a teenager’s work time is limited until he turns 16 years old. So usually everything happens like this: I came home, ate, procrastinated, and then, when I have time and I want to hang out, I take work tasks, and then I do the lessons. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xs/fs/f6/xsfsf6gdr9izpbk1xkhpry7gfny.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I use three monitors: on one - Slack, on the second - documentation, and on the third - VS Code. </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When a new challenge comes to our team,</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am called in to chat with the customer with a request to evaluate the timing. Usually I evaluate them by analogy with past projects and immediately warn: “Look, this is so many man-hours, but this work can take me a week or two”. Then the customer decides for himself - to give the task to one of the guys at full time for urgent development, or to entrust it to me. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/jw/jn/oljwjn6l5ofhrincy0aa8ht1hru.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first, tasks came to me in PM in Slack - a great time) Now everything is recorded in Jira, like everyone else.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Once every two weeks I have a sync with the project, so that she understands what I'm doing now. There is also a code review from the guys. Also, like everyone else, I am asked to log time in Jira: I just upload the data from Toggl, there it is more accurate. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What I spend earned on.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Part of the money goes to all sorts of subscriptions and software for personal projects:</font></font><br>
