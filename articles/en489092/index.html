<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
A little over a year ago, I was a completely monolingual who spoke only English, with zero knowledge of French. And after twelve months, I easily passed the international DELF B2 exam. If you do not know what “B2” means, look at the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">CEFR scale</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, all my successes are the result of home schooling and practice</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . My training was completely independent, without any special training programs. This is only possible thanks to the many amazing resources available on the Internet, many of which are free. Importantly, such a result was achieved because I preferred productive communication, in particular, spending a lot of time talking with those who know French well.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is worth noting that my pace of training was somewhat aggressive, because over the past year I have devoted a lot of time to learning French, however, this is still much less than full time training. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I can’t say that I’m completely fluent, but so that you better understand what results were achieved, I’ll give a list of what no longer causes me problems:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conversation in French for hours;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Understanding the various types of French media (e.g. news and videos on YouTube);</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reading articles written for native French speakers;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Constructing thoughts in French;</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, I'm still very far from the level of media. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I definitely have weaknesses, and I can’t express myself in French as well as in English. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, I am very pleased with my level of knowledge of French and I think that many learners of the language would also be pleased.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why am I writing this article</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I know that many people want to learn a foreign language, but the task is certainly not an easy one. There are many resources, tools, websites, methods, books, applications, activities, and programs; some are free, while others are expensive and sometimes it’s hard to figure out which ones to use and when. I spent a lot of time studying various programs and figuring out how effective they would be in my case. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now that the goal has been achieved and I learned French, I decided to write about it to show other language learners how exactly I did it. Most of what I have done will be applicable to the study of other languages.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I will not tell you anything revolutionary - I did not find any “secret trick” or “reliable method”, but I think that the path I have traveled over the past year will be useful to those who have just started to learn a new language. I especially hope that this article will help those who start from the same position: knowledge of only one language, lack of any knowledge of the language being studied, lack of a conversational environment, non-stationary training and lack of familiar native speakers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, how many people - so many opinions. I don’t think that my method is the best, but it undoubtedly proved to be quite good and, I am sure, its use can be very useful. Later I will mention some points that I would change if I started the process anew.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you just want to get an idea of ​​what I did during the year, first I’ll give you a phased schedule of my French studies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After that, we will talk in more detail about the rest, including about the resources used, the order of their use and how to make the process as rational as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also, I will describe in more detail what I can and cannot do with the current level of knowledge in order to build up the most accurate idea of ​​what it means to speak the language at a solid level B2.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What was done</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The most important items are in bold. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Approximate milestones in italics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some dates are inaccurate.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">11/18: Complete newbie (A0), with the exception of commonplace phrases like “Hello, do you speak English?”;</font></font></i></li>

<li>12/19:   DELF B2;</li>
<li><b>12/19: ,   DELF B2  86/100!</b></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Technically, I learned a few French phrases in the fall of 2018 to prepare for a trip to Europe, but only the simplest ones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I began to seriously study French in the middle of November 2018 and went to DELF almost 13 months later, but given the ease of passing it, I think I reached B2 level already by 10-11 months.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is my real level of language proficiency?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I want to clarify my possibilities and limitations in French so that you have a more realistic picture of what it is possible to achieve in a year of study. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As mentioned above, it is quite easy to conduct lengthy conversations and understand the French media without any problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here are some things that still cause difficulties:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>    . ,    -         .     «»   ,    .</li>
<li> ,  .     -,        ,   .    .</li>
<li>   .     ,    ,            . ,    ,     ,  :</li>
<li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fs/r9/d7/fsr9d7i8zxlggb6jahsicm59pe8.png"></li>
<li>     .   ,       ,          .</li>
<li>    .  ? .</li>
<li>    ,     . ,     ,          ,    .       ,  .</li>
<li> ,  .         ,             , ,          .</li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another problem: problems with French in everyday situations. I have too little experience in personal communication with carriers. If you are completely immersed in the language environment, you can easily learn all the little things: how to tie shoelaces, point to a stain on someone's shirt, pass the ball to someone in a basketball game. Of course, I know all the basics and with the transfer of their intentions, even in such situations, great difficulties do not arise, but my phrases can often be unnatural. On the other hand, thanks to many hours of random conversations with people, I have a good experience in conversations on general topics. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Based on the foregoing, let's talk about the B2 exam. Here are my points for exam B2 (threshold - 50/100, minimum 5/25 in each section):</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hu/5x/uc/hu5xuco0gdafhgtotifxwk01dwo.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As you can see, I was given the highest rating for my speech (conversation). Almost perfect result. This is understandable, since I spent a lot of time talking practice and spent about 100 hours communicating with carriers. During the exam, I was nervous, but during the conversation I was very mobile, easily conveyed my arguments and understood almost everything I was asked about. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For writing and reading, the ratings also pleased, for each of the categories I received about 90% of the points. There were no problems with this either; I fully understood the texts provided.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Listening, of course, has become the worst part, both in terms of points and overall impression. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I “understood” all the words from the playing records, but I was forced to concentrate on several minutes at the same time, answering questions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was very little experience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In particular, on a shorter recording (2-3 minutes), listened 1 time, I answered only 1 question out of 7, when the recording was already over; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">not understanding that he gave answers to all other questions along the way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am sure that I got a few happy points from guessing on some issues and 10 points here would not surprise me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, I will say that most of the complexity is associated with the format, and not with knowledge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A little more practice in listening would probably simplify the task.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reflections on My French Learning Experience</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before speaking in detail about the methods of learning French and sharing recommendations, I want to express some general thoughts about my experience and learning the language as a whole.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no “ideal” or “simple” method. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mine is no exception</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
People are different and different methods come in. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this article, I will explain what I did and why, it seems to me, it worked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, in the end, I'm just some random guy who learned French - one of the easiest languages ​​for an English-speaking person to pump to the level of "above average". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am very far from the position of “expert polyglot master” and all my advice may not suit you.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I spent a lot of time reading tips on learning French, and although I will try to talk about many useful resources in this article, you should conduct your own research on working methods and methods that suit you personally. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, you should not spend too much time on planning, but it is better to start the actual study of the language as soon as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Contrary to popular belief, watching a polyglot video on YouTube does not teach you to fluently speak your preferred language.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learning languages ​​at school is built extremely inefficient</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A huge number of people spent many years “learning” languages ​​at school and as a result were unable to maintain an elementary conversation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did it happen that I managed to start to fully speak French 6 months after the start of the study?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I strongly believe that learning languages ​​at school, especially in the United States, is usually extremely inefficient. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you once found it difficult to learn a language at school, do not let this affect your confidence in learning a new language. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With a reasonable approach to practice, you can learn much more independently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Avoid unnecessary, useless work in order to spend more time talking face to face with teachers who are preparing their lessons specifically for you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead of a stereotyped, national educational process according to the standard program in a group of 20 people, your language journey will be fully adapted for you.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You don’t have to learn so much</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Firstly, no matter how large-scale the task of learning a new language might seem, console yourself with the fact that you really only need a certain amount of knowledge. You need to know only a couple of thousand words and not too many grammar rules and this will already give everything you need for a comfortable conversation. Of course, you will have to spend time practicing and applying the acquired knowledge, but with the right approach, it becomes very pleasant to observe your progress.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For languages ​​like French, you have a huge advantage if you are already fluent in English. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are a huge number of interconnections between French and English, which means that you will be able to understand thousands of French words, even if you did not say a word in French before! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, most of the French grammar is similar to English, although, of course, some things will seem strange when you come across them.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a matter of </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">time</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , not </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ability.</font></font></i></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes the process of learning a language is overwhelming. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To maintain motivation, I told myself to believe in the result, and that if I devote enough time to the study process, in the end, the goal will be achieved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And he was right. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As I said in the previous section, it is worth learning a certain number of words and grammar rules - and with some effective practice, you will be able to maintain a conversation without any problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With consistent work on the selection of new words and the regular desire to correct shortcomings, whatever they may be, you will achieve your goal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not about abilities, but about time. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, not all practices are equally effective. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make sure that your actions bring results, and that you do not just spend all your time watching French films, calling it productivity.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learning languages ​​is depressing</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are many difficulties in learning a language - at least overcoming the endless feeling of frustration that you will encounter. If from time to time you do not feel frustrated, then most likely you have not learned much. Watching movies with subtitles is fun, but you probably don’t have difficulties and do not force yourself to learn. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An attempt to correctly express an idea in a foreign language causes frustration. It’s unpleasant to notice how you again make a grammatical mistake, which you have already made 100 times before. Be dissatisfied with yourself in moderation and let it encourage you to push the boundaries and go to the next level. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, you should not be frustrated without a good reason, but good practice often makes you feel just that. If you really want to learn, get used to it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
(PS When I started, I sometimes watched </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this video</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> to re-motivate myself after another bout of frustration. As soon as I reached a sufficient level (about 6 months!), It did not cause any difficulties.)</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Middle Plateau</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first few months of learning a language is really fun because you learn very fast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I remember how lessons began at Duolingo and within a month I learned to understand most of the comments on YouTube for French music videos on YouTube and it motivated me well.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the end, you learn more and more aspects of the language - past tense, pronouns, basic vocabulary - and stop feeling progress. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this stage, I did not always succeed in answering to myself whether I was really progressing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When this happens, remember the goal and believe in the process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Newly learned words will not occur so often, and the learned grammar rules will be a little more incomprehensible, but as you gain new knowledge, you will gradually notice how the number of errors decreases, and what previously confused you will be taken for granted.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5 most important things to achieve success (in my opinion)</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Obviously, learning a language is not easy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I cannot be completely sure why I succeeded, but I think some of the character traits below are necessary.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>:   ,   .    ,      !      ,       .     .</li>
<li>:    .     ,           -   .</li>

</ul><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resources I have used and can recommend</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now I’ll talk in more detail about the various resources that I used, and how best to interact with them.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Duolingo</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Duolingo is a popular entry-level learning platform for many foreign languages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most people use the Duolingo mobile app, but there is also a desktop version. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Duolingo was for me the main tool for learning the basics of the French language.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why I recommend Duolingo</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I can’t comment on other platforms, but Duolingo turned out to be really useful for me in mastering the basics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even the well-established course on Duolingo is a very long way to reach the level of "below average", at least in reading and writing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, Duolingo is often criticized as a platform for learning the language, and I actually agree with most of this criticism, but it is applicable if you use Duolingo inefficiently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No matter how much Duolingo likes to tell you about it, 5 minutes a day with a smartphone in their hands will not make you fluent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I will try to explain how to use Duolingo as efficiently and effectively as possible.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Effective use of Duolingo</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here are a few key tips for using Duolingo effectively:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Use the desktop version;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Turn off "Word Bank";</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make sure your chosen course has enough good reviews;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read the tips that accompany each lesson, if any;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read the discussions under complex sentences.</font></font></li>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Use the desktop version of Duolingo</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although I originally used the Duolingo mobile app, pretty soon I switched to the desktop version. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone knows about the Duolingo application, but the dextop version is noticeably superior to the mobile one and that’s why:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are no “life” hearts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can exercise as much as necessary without encountering restrictions due to errors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To get enough practice and quick progress, this is necessary.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Full access to additional resources, such as a forum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the application you can see a discussion of only a specific task.</font></font></li>
<li>   .      ,   .  ,     (ùôï…),     (       ).</li>
<li>  .        ,  ,    -.</li>
<li>        — ,  word bank      ,    .</li>
</ul><br>
<h3> Word Bank</h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my opinion, disabling the word bank is absolutely necessary for effective learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By disabling word bank, you are forced to accurately type sentences and this has a very positive effect on the result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You no longer guess, but remember. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without the need to constantly enter and pronounce phrases, they are much easier to forget. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without a word bank, you can improve your spelling, learn more grammar, and replenish your vocabulary. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Word bank was created for people who just need to create the appearance of learning for themselves, without mistakes and disappointments.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make sure your chosen course has good reviews.</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As far as I understand, Duolingo courses are created mainly due to the efforts of volunteers, and therefore, as a rule, they have significant differences in several aspects: sound quality, the number of grammar notes, discussability on the forum, etc. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some Duolingo courses have really good reviews. Judging from my experience in exercises with French and Spanish courses for native English speakers, they are both pretty well done. Also, I have repeatedly heard good reviews about some others - German, Esperanto and Norwegian.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to the community, there are also courses of rather poor quality, for example, Japanese and Mandarin (although lately, things could have changed). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some courses, such as Italian, are quite short, and therefore you will not be able to achieve a high level using Duolingo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other courses, there are no tips or notes at all, which will lead to blind lessons and a corresponding lack of results! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Choosing a course at Duolingo carefully read the reviews so as not to lose the time invested in studying in vain.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read the tips that accompany each lesson, if any.</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In many courses, Duolingo provides grammar tips for several lessons or the entire course. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, these tips are often very useful in preparation for the lesson and help you quickly understand why some sentences are pronounced in a certain way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, do not forget that the tips for the lessons do not contain all the necessary information and to compensate for this:</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read discussions under complex sentences</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At times, the Duolingo forum can be very helpful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most interesting topics are discussions of individual sentences, where you can easily find a huge number of useful explanations for a particular case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In particular, for the French language course, I often find detailed explanations of the tricky concepts and idioms encountered in the lessons throughout the course, especially with the remarkable author Sitesurf.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Other recommendations for using Duolingo</font></font></h3><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oddities Duolingo</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Duolingo has its own oddities that appear even in the most well-designed courses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is sometimes annoying. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, when you write the correct translation, but it is not accepted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is frustrating at times, but in the end, Duolingo is not able to recognize all the possible correct options, so in such cases you have to adjust your answers to the “Duolingo style”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over time, the base expands and there are fewer such cases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes I receive letters with a notification that my system has accepted the translation as correct.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
People also complain about the senselessness of some sentences (for example, “I found a dinosaur eating carrots in the bathroom”). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, this is not critical, because the point is to replenish your vocabulary and teach you grammar, as well as add a bit of humor to the learning process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I recommend not focusing on individual proposals and their “credibility”, but concentrating on understanding their foundation and design.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Climbing a Duolingo Tree</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I completely closed the whole French tree, bringing each skill to level 5. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth saying that during the execution of these tasks by me, their format was slightly different from today's and the 5th level implied the repetition of the same skill more than 5 times. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, this is unnecessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think you could reduce the number of repetitions to 3 times, although I'm not sure how good this idea is.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the old format, the whole process took me about 9 months of regular classes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today I believe that I spent a lot of extra time on this and probably should have finished a few months earlier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Please note that I set a goal to reach the maximum in Duolingo and have been doing this constantly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's not obligatory. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without even taking Duolingo's motivational messages into account, 10 minutes a day is really not much. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to my rough estimates, it takes about 150 hours of constant effort to close a modern French or Spanish skill tree.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Laddering Skills</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Laddering may not be an entirely appropriate term, since it also refers to the use of one foreign language in the process of learning another, but I still call it that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The essence of the method is not to "maximize" one skill, but to move along the tree gradually, closing one level of each group. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This allows you to stretch the material a little and better to assimilate it by repeating what has already been done later. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it’s not clear what this is about, look at this example picture:</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Italki</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Italki is a platform on which language learners find professional tutors and interlocutors. I worked on my speaking skills, mainly there. Among other things, Italki has "notebooks" where you can write your texts and give them to the media for verification. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seemed to me that Italki is loved by everyone in the language community and I completely share this feeling. Italki's lessons have contributed significantly to my progress in developing my speaking skills. You definitely need to talk a lot, especially with those who are much better than you know the language or know it from childhood. Only in this way can one advance markedly in communication and understanding of native speakers.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I started taking personal lessons on Italki around the fourth month of study, as soon as I had enough vocabulary for a beginner and I was able to formulate simple sentences. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For me personally, it was a good time, but of course you can start earlier if you want. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems ineffective, for example, to learn the first few hundred words and the basics of grammar on Italki. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But you can use the platform to practice correct pronunciation and as a base of useful resources and tips for learning the language in the early stages.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to look for teachers on Italki</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Italki has hundreds of teachers from all major languages, so it can be difficult to choose one. My experience shows that with most teachers it is easy to communicate, and therefore, in general, it is not necessary to go in cycles in the selection stage. Do not repeat my mistakes and do not hold for months for one teacher (even if he was great) - try to work out with a few and see which ones you are best at. And yet, you will not get used to the way of speaking one specific person too much. In addition, teacher ratings are extremely high, so 5.0 stars mean almost nothing.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At first I chose native speakers, but after several lessons I realized that I did not feel the difference between native speakers and non-native speakers. Every Italki teacher has a very high level of language, so if you are a beginner, I think it makes no sense to prefer one or the other. Unless you want to talk to someone who has grown completely immersed in language and culture.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I also rigidly filtered out my lessons by price. I have no experience working with more expensive teachers, but I found that less expensive teachers were quite suitable for me. I think if you are a beginner, cheaper teachers are great for you. More expensive tutors will most likely offer you more resources or be more qualified professionals, but, in my opinion, all you need to do is communicate a lot until you become an advanced student or pursue any specific goals .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you are preparing for a qualification exam such as DELF, then you can spend some more money on a professional teacher who specializes in preparing for exams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I took such a teacher for only four lessons a few weeks before the DELF exam, but I was amazed at her savvy and the amount of help she provided me in preparing for the exam. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you study on your own, such a teacher can really qualified to tell you how to prepare for the test and for any surprises that you may encounter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are not preparing for the exam, then this is probably not necessary.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Effective use of Italki</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This section will not be very interesting, because I believe that using Italki is very simple: you just need to talk a lot. And since I had no desire to do grammar or exercise with teachers at all, I spent most of my time simply discussing random topics with them. Sometimes I was upset because I didn’t eliminate my “weaknesses”, such as, for example, using certain tenses of verbs, but, in the end, just talking in normal mode for tens of hours was enough for me to start talking at a very decent level. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Naturally, you can always ask your Italki tutors for specific help, which I sometimes resorted to, but if you act like me and say that you just want to talk for an hour, this will probably be good for you.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Notebooks Italki</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I also highly recommend using Italki Notebooks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I should have started earlier, but I began to write texts in notebooks near the end of my educational process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Periodic writing of small texts and their correction helps to correct small grammatical and structural errors that can degrade the quality of your written speech. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, when I began to publish notes from notebooks, for some reason random people began to correct them even without my request! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was delighted to receive such detailed reviews, and I looked through some of the uncorrected texts with the teacher for several lessons on Italki. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did not realize that I had made so many written mistakes, but after correcting my texts, I was able to eliminate many of them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anki</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Anki is an application that uses a technique called interval repetition, designed to maximize effectiveness when learning a set of words or concepts, such as a dictionary. It can be considered as an improved system of didactic cards. Anki is extremely effective for learning a lot of information, and for this reason it is popular in the language learning community and, not surprisingly, among medical students. Its interface is a bit strange, but you will quickly get used to it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After a thorough initial step, I began to use Anki to improve my vocabulary. For about 7 months I was not able to achieve reliable knowledge, but after a few months I remembered thousands of French words and significantly improved my understanding and sentence building skills.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many say that you need to create your own set of Anki cards, but I was too lazy to do this, and I used a set of 5000 of the most common French words. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Similar card sets are available for several other languages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">French cards can be found </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Every day I memorized 50 new words, while repeating all the previous words. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I almost always used Franco-English cards, although Anglo-French are probably also very useful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After several months of consistent practice, I went through the whole set. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was a pretty aggressive pace, because by the end I had to go somewhere around 200-300 cards a day, but as it turned out, it suited me well enough.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">InnerFrench Podcast</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
InnerFrench is a podcast aimed at improving the perception of language by students of an intermediate level. Instead of studying grammar or “boring” topics, Hugo Cotton, a podcast host, talks about a wide range of interesting questions, such as “The misfortunes of lottery winners,” “Can we trust our brains?” and Life on Mars. The podcast is fully in French. As of the beginning of 2020, about 75 episodes are available, lasting from 30 to 40 minutes. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This podcast was highly recommended on the Internet, so I decided to check it out as soon as I reached the lower intermediate level, after about 6 or 7 months. I finished listening to him for several months and by the end I felt that my listening comprehension had improved significantly.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What is really good about this podcast is that Hugo does not speak fast and simple in earlier episodes, making it easier to listen to French for a long period of time. In later episodes, he speaks faster and uses more advanced vocabulary and expressions in his speech. This type of intermediate-level, fully French content is the kind of material that can help you narrow the gap between intermediate and advanced listening when cartoons are too easy and news broadcasts leave you at a loss.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It should be remembered that Hugo speaks on a variety of topics, some of which are more likely political or moral in nature (for example, immigration to France or veganism). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Personally, I did not mind this, but Hugo definitely argues his specific point of view, which some people may misunderstand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, I heard that the French, as a rule, are rather self-confident, so you can consider this as a way of getting used to the French culture.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lingoda</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Lingoda is a platform for group or individual lessons with professional teachers using the Lingoda language training course. Each lesson lasts 1 hour, has an appropriate level (for example, A1.1 or B1.3) and covers a specific topic, such as “Mastering the Future” or “Writing a Letter”. A PDF file is offered with explanations and exercises, which is used during each lesson. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After 2 months, I started using Lingoda by signing up for their Half Marathon promotion (now called Sprint) when they return 50% of the cost if you take 45 lessons in 90 days (with some additional restrictions). I did not complete this task in full - I mastered about half.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think that Lingoda is a really good platform for learning one of the languages ​​available on it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I studied there fast enough, and I had no problems with the content and structure of classes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite this, I stopped classes at Lingoda and canceled my subscription. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some of the reasons for this were as follows:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did not like to order lessons 7 days before the start, which they began to demand from the middle of my half marathon;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don’t particularly like going to classes in general; instead, I prefer to study on my own or speak the language depending on the case;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did not want to take a clearly defined number of lessons every month;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Italki seemed to me an adequate replacement;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cost.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, if you like to attend classes or want to really improve quickly, take a few Lingoda lessons (especially if these are private lessons) is probably one of the most effective and efficient ways to learn a language. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you're interested, you can sign up for a free trial and check it out yourself.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cool Lingoda Notes</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The cool Lingoda notes seemed pretty useful to me, so I downloaded all the notes at level A1.1-C2. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did not know how to do this automatically, so I downloaded them all manually, which took about an hour and a half.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Later, after 6 or 7 months of training, I began to look through all the notes from class A1 to B1 to fill in all the gaps that I had. At the same time, I studied many things superficially, instead of actually performing the exercises, as they usually do in the classroom, and also without the presence of a teacher who would help me cope with everything. However, I have found that this is a fairly effective resource and reference for various grammatical concepts. Also there are many sections on various specific topics, which provided a certain variety of my vocabulary. Also note that to achieve B2 level I didn’t read B2-C2 level notes at all (I just didn’t need them).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, if you are looking for a resource to study grammar, then a good grammar textbook can be replaced with Lingoda materials, but personally, for my purposes, even PDF files turned out to be quite effective.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Help websites</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here are some sites I regularly used:</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wordreference.com</font></font></a></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is a great resource for finding the meanings of words and examples of their use in sentences. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the meaning of a word or expression was in doubt, I searched for it here. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you use Google Chrome (and maybe other browsers), you can configure a separate search engine to simplify the use of this service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, when I want to see the meaning of the word “attendre”, I just need to type “fren attendre” in the address bar to get to the page of meanings of the word “attendre”</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">conjugator.reverso.net</font></font></a></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I used this tool to search for verb conjugations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As with the previous site, you can set up a search engine and greatly simplify everything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, by typing “rfr attendre” in the address bar, I will immediately see the conjugations of the verb “attendre”.</font></font><br>

I came across these sites while searching for grammatical constructions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They have many interesting articles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, I often looked in there to check the subjunctive materials.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">French music</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Listening to music in the language you are learning is a great way to get to know the original pronunciation, replenish the vocabulary and motivate yourself to understand the language. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now it’s nice to remember how I found several French songs and gradually, as I studied new words and improved listening comprehension, I understood their meaning more and more. Sometimes I purposefully searched for lyrics and thanks to this I learned new interesting words and slang expressions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, there are a lot of French artists and you will surely find music to your liking. Personally, I recommend: </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lomepal, Stromae, Eddy de Pretto, Angèle, Roméo Elvis and L'Impératrice</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you find that you do not understand the text - do not be discouraged. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even I, having the current level of knowledge, have problems with the perception of many songs, especially those saturated with slang. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although, if you think about it, in half the cases I don’t understand that people sing in my native English, so this is quite natural. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes music is just hard to understand. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, if you want to diversify your educational process after reaching an intermediate level, I recommend trying listening - listening to a song and trying to record as many words as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I tried it for a couple of songs and I really liked it! </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here are</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> my results.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Build a Strong Core"</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Build a Strong Core is a 30-day program for Hugo Cotton, creator of the InnerFrench podcast. It is designed to help intermediate-level speakers correct common grammatical errors and better understand native French speakers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Considering how wonderful the InnerFrench podcast was, after some thought, I decided to spend 99 euros, signing up for this course too. Every day a new lesson comes out, usually including a short video on a topic related to France (for example, the big French-speaking world) and a short video on various grammatical topics (for example, how French-speaking people don’t say “ne” out loud). Also, there is an active group on Facebook, but I never went to it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Passing this program, I have already approached level B2, so I did not get as much from it as I could if I were, say, at level A2. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the speech in the video, in my opinion, was too slow, so I usually accelerated them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since I reached B2 without this program, I do not think it is necessary, but it is implemented perfectly and may be worth your attention if your level is not so high. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This program is good because it allows you to get used to the speech of native French speakers, given the features of natural pronunciation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although I, in due time, achieved results in other ways, this program could definitely speed up the process.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Other resources that I used</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I admit that I watched on YouTube the cartoon </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Peppa Pig"</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in French, being a complete beginner. It was useful, and in general, viewing thematic media of an appropriate level is a good way to improve the perception of an unfamiliar language by ear. But only if you are actively listening, not just reading subtitles. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, sometimes I watched French </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">youtubles</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> to practice listening and to “immerse” a little in French culture. On the Internet you can find a lot of recommendations of interesting French YouTube channels. InnerFrench also has its own channel for mastering mid-level speech. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
About ten months later I read </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Le Petit Prince</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">which was also pretty good practice. This is the only book I have read in French. I think this was not absolutely necessary, but still the time was not wasted. This is not the easiest book. I can recommend for an average level. You can get to know passé simple in advance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">changed my phone language</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> to French and this not only taught me a few new words (for example, stopwatch, settings, unlocking), but also made the browser home page French, which opened up many interesting articles for me, reading which was also good practice.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Later I signed up for the French newsletter and read a lot of letters. I didn’t read everything, but nevertheless I replenished my vocabulary quite well. A letter of this kind is more likely to be at an advanced level, so you should not rush into this before reaching the average. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Listened to </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learn French with Jessica</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> podcasts </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">while still a beginner. The podcast is in English, but explains some specific points that are difficult for a beginner to understand (for example, a strange French counting system, “c'est” versus “il est”, etc.). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For more advanced students, the same Jessica has a </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">French Voices</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> podcast.</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. There you will find full-length interviews in French with many interesting French speakers (for example, directors, scientists, etc.) I listened to it a little, but not because it is bad - for an advanced student this podcast will be a great listening practice! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, from time to time, I visited the subreddits </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">/ r / languagelearning</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">/ r / French</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">/ r / learnfrench</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , especially as a </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">newbie</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Thanks to this, I found many resources mentioned above and learned a lot of useful French on the topic from the respective posts. Several times I returned to this post for inspiration. Having reached a confident average level, I sometimes looked in </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">/ r / France</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , which became an interesting source for reading and updating the vocabulary.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resources I have not used</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are many other recommended resources, most of which I have never tried. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, you yourself are free to choose where to get information, mastering the main areas of the language: vocabulary, speaking, the basics of grammar, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is a short list of what you should pay attention to:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pimsleur</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Glossika</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Assimil</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Babbel</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Podcast Coffee Break French</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">HelloTalk / Tandem</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Films or television shows</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Books (Harry Potter is a very popular choice)</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A note on movies and TV shows: they can be a good way to learn a language, but I never practiced this, except to watch a few cartoons at the very beginning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important to feel and understand that you are actively </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">learning</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , not just being lazy and just convincing yourself that you are “learning”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In particular, I recommend to refuse subtitles in the native language. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Subtitles in the language you are learning will be much more useful, but if you can do without it, it is better not to use subtitles at all if the complexity of the content of the film does not exceed your current level.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sample "curriculum"</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since we have already discussed all the recommended resources, here is an approximate plan for learning a language </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">based on my experience</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Of course, you can find 1000 more people with 1000 other methods, so feel free to choose and try different options. This “curriculum” is what I would do if there was a need to re-learn French this year. Also, this is approximately what I intend to do in the process of learning Spanish in 2020. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, especially if you need motivation, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">find interesting French media</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and media to motivate yourself to learn the language. For me it was music, for others it could be series or books. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Next, I recommend </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">going through the Duolingo tree</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to achieve levels A1 and A2. Filling up a French tree will teach you all the basic grammar concepts, and you will have a very solid foundation for moving to more advanced material. Of course, be sure to use Duolingo correctly and efficiently, as described above. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After going through a good part (maybe half or so) of the Duolingo tree, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">start going through the set of 5000 most common words on Anki</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Try to learn 20 words a day, looking for new ones as they appear. If you met Anki in the later stages and already know a bunch of words - raise the bar to 50 words per day, although this is quite intense. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At about the same time, if you wish, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">start taking Lingoda lessons</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , around level A2.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regardless of whether you study Lingoda or not, start Italki lessons</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . If this is your only source of conversational practice, try to take more lessons. Once or twice a week is already a pretty good load, but if you are ambitious, you can certainly do more. Conversation is a great idea, with a variety of themes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Going to the end of the Duolingo tree, you </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">should switch to searching for resources for the middle level</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . The </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">InnerFrench</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> podcast </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">their YouTube channel are</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> perfect for this. You can also redistribute your efforts and take more Italki or Lingoda lessons to get more practice speaking and listening, rather than reading and writing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Whatever you do, you will probably notice that there are some difficulties with some aspects of grammar. Consult a reputable grammar resource, but don't spend too much time doing grammar exercises. Instead, try to generally understand the concepts and practice with them orally or in writing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I also recommend periodically </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">writing in Italki notebooks and</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , if necessary, reviewing your texts with Italki teachers. This will help improve your writing skills.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The mid-level stage can be difficult, but I think that by studying enough materials of appropriate quality, speaking practice, working with vocabulary and patience, you will be able to overcome it. Use everything - listening to music and watching movies is good, but </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">don't forget to read books and articles</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . If your goal is to learn to articulate thoughts in writing, continue to write texts and submit them for review. Be curious and keep exploring! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Cheer up and repeat the last step before B2.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite the fact that I am only at B2 level, I imagine that the transition to C1 (and, finally, to C2) is the result of the constant accumulation of more knowledge and the elimination of shortcomings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, you need to learn more technical vocabulary and learn some rare grammatical features, which at my level I did not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Continue to practice speaking and listening, actively study the original content to get acquainted with all the idioms and expressions that are used only by carriers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The language environment is likely to be increasingly important in achieving these levels, although I think that you will be able to achieve at least a solid C1 at home without any problems.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learn cheaply</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If your budget is limited, here are some tips to minimize your expenses while learning a language:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Duolingo is free and unlimited in the desktop version;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Italki has a Language Exchange section where you can exchange lessons with a native speaker for free;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lingoda offers a free trial if you want to take a look at their content.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Otherwise, everything is either free or optional. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, your path will be more difficult than that of a person with a large budget, but still there are enough open resources to be able to rise to a relatively high level without spending money.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you still have some money, I highly recommend spending it on teachers on Italki. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For many languages, you can find cheap tutors, in the range of $ 5- $ 8 / hour.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learning pronunciation</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite the fact that the French language is notorious for its difficult pronunciation, in fact I did not have any special difficulties with this. The first time I spoke French online after about two months of study, they complimented me on my emphasis. And even though I made quite a few minor mistakes, in general, everything was pretty good. I think I was a little lucky in this regard, but I will still give some tips on pronunciation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I mentioned earlier that “curiosity” and “independence” are really important qualities for independent language learning. I think most of my success in making a speech was in understanding what the correct pronunciation is and how to reproduce it.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Starting to learn French at Duolingo, I often repeated what I heard aloud to get used to the pronunciation of French words. I listened and repeated the words over and over until I felt comfortable with the pronunciation (some of my friends who watched this did not share my joy). Sometimes the phrases were not clear enough (the Duolingo sound is not perfect, although it gets better), and sometimes the words were too difficult to pronounce (for example, the word “voiture” was very difficult for me for a while), but with many simpler words I was pretty decent.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I also read many articles and watched a lot of videos about French pronunciation, in particular trying to learn how to repeat some complex French sounds, such as “u” and “r”. There were difficulties for some time, but after a month or two I was able to pronounce them well enough. It took a lot of consistent effort to reproduce these sounds, but in the end everything began to improve. Also, the pronunciation of French songs helped me with the pronunciation: “r” was finally possible at the time of singing the song Stromae (say “retrouverai” enough times, and it's all about the hat).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even if you feel stupid during such exercises - you still need to continue to practice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People who pay attention to pronunciation and force themselves to correct mistakes improve much more efficiently than those who are simply afraid to sound stupid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you don't want to sound stupid, learning a language is not for you! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here are some specific pronunciation observations for learners of French that might help you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For me, these were very painful moments in the past:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nasal vowels, in particular, the difference between “-an” and “–in”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have often practiced the distinction between attendre, étendre, éteindre, and atteindre.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A similar situation with the difference between é and è. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is thin and you need to get used to it.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pronunciation of s. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The sound “s” is pronounced differently: “ss”, “s” at the end of a word and “s” not at the end of a word.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“In-” and “im-” at the beginning of words are pronounced differently depending on the next letter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, “insensible” and “imparfait” versus “inevitable” and “innovation”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's see if you can figure out the patterns!</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lezones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over time, your hearing will get used to it, but it is definitely quite difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read articles on the Internet.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“-Oy” is not pronounced like in “boy”, but rather like “waee”, for example, in “voyager” or “tutoyer”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Voyage” sounds like “vwaee-ahj.”</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to pronounce plus based on context. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Honestly, I still do not know this completely.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Finally, I find the French pronunciation surprisingly consistent, especially given its reputation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although it is often impossible to learn how to spell a word only after hearing it, you can usually learn how to pronounce a word by reading it, you just have to learn the rules.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Final word</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Learning French has become an incredibly useful and enjoyable process for me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The world of a completely new culture opened up for me and a love of learning languages ​​appeared. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It took a lot of time and work, but still, learning a language (especially “easy”, like French for English speakers) is not at all as difficult as studying, for example, theoretical physics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With sufficient dedication and effective practice, almost anyone can learn a foreign language at a fairly high level. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite the fact that the year is a rather aggressive timeline for studying a language at a high level, it is obvious that this is quite feasible if you are willing to invest time and work efficiently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope that my experience will help you on your own journey into the world of languages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Good luck</font></font><br>
