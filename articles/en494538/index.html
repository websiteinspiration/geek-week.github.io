<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before falling asleep without interrupting the broadcast on Twitch, streamer Matthew Rinaudo, nicknamed Mizkif, thought about how angry his mother would be if he told her that he was making money in a dream. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“She now believes that I’m not doing anything at all,” Rinaudo joked during a broadcast for his viewers. “Wait until she finds out that I literally made money in a dream.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Rinaudo turned on the bot, allowing viewers to upload videos after sending the donation, and went to sleep. Clips went to the top of the screen, and most of the screen was occupied with a picture of a resting man on the back of Rinaudo. Many hours and embarrassing videos, he woke up later, becoming richer by $ 5600. To show that he understands how this trick worked, he gave his Nintendo Switch to one of the sponsors.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The latest trend in Twitch streaming is to sleep on camera. And that’s it. For the past few weeks, streamers have trained their cameras to look at their mattresses while their owners are snoring. In the interim hours, viewers use the Twitch donation feature, sending streamers small amounts of money - $ 2 here, $ 5 there. A couple of streamers called what is happening "pajama stream."</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“I think it’s time for me to sleepy, sleepy, sleepy,” said Twitch streamer and model Caitlin Siraguza, nicknamed Amouranth. It was at 6 o’clock in the morning, and for several hours she was broadcasting her whispering and scratching the microphone for the ASMR </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">stream</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , which was passing to the quiet piano music. In the chat, good night wishes came in. Syracuse encouraged fans to sign up and send donations; every 20 subscriptions push her alarm clock an hour ahead. She started playing the sounds of rain and went to sleep. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a chat next to the stream, one viewer asked: “But do people really follow how she sleeps?” Another answered: “I want to watch how she sleeps all the time. I love her".</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Eight hours later, Syracuse woke up, dressed, and returned to Twitch streaming to continue playing the ball race. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Casey Cavines, nicknamed Kaceytron, says she came up with a dream streamer a couple of months ago on a camping trip when she decided not to turn off the camera for the night and woke up with nearly 2,000 active viewers. “I think my viewers like the situation the most in the morning when they try to wake me up,” she says. In most sleepy streams, viewers can send money to the streamer so that the bot read their text messages out loud. “It brings a great income.” Cavines says her viewers also like to hear the murmurs that precede going to bed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Note perev .: account Cavines </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">closed a week ago</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, after she “joked” visiting another blogger about the fact that she wants to spread the coronavirus as much as possible, “because the world will become better without sick and poor people.”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although pajama streams are returning to fashion, probably the most famous example of such an event happened in 2017. A video titled “How I Earned $ 5k by Sleeping 8 Hours”, which was watched by 3.8 million people, was recorded by notorious prank fan and former Twitch streamer Paul Denino, nicknamed Ice Poseidon, does just that. Spectators sent donations, including the sound of gunfire, a knock on the door, and dubstep remixes of bagpipes. Denino sometimes woke up from the sounds and threw a pillow at the camera or cursed at the audience. The legendary streamer playing speed games, Narcissa Wright, once broadcast a video of how she rests to regain her strength, but said that she had already got into trouble with Twitch in the past for such tricks. “Everything was innocent, and I just didn't want to turn off the stream,” she says.Regarding the fact that sleepy streams are becoming fashionable, she said that she “feels avenged”.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sleepy streams like Shiraguza are more like ASMR videos or Japanese hugging cafes where sponsors pay an hourly fee to feel close to strangers. Recently, the Twitch talk category has begun to gain immense popularity, in part because thousands of viewers sit at any moment wanting to experience parasocial interaction. The secret to Twitch’s continued popularity is its interactivity that brings fans closer to their fan base — at least in a digital sense. When they monitor the streamer’s sleep, and possibly imagine themselves sleeping next to it, they feel less alone. This trend has already gone beyond Twitch; TikTok’s most popular streamers have recently embraced this tradition.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, in addition to funny tricks or proximity, there is another reason why Twitch streamers sometimes fall asleep in front of the camera: they get tired. Sometimes they fall into an </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unplanned dream</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> after a day of games, thereby entertaining thousands of people. Thousands of people watched the streamer of the World of Warcraft game, nicknamed Asmongold, take a break for restoring sleep while waiting for the World of Warcraft Classic servers to let it through. Last year, the Hearthstone streamer plunged into an unplanned dream and woke up with 200 spectators.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite all the glamor associated with earning money through video games, successful Twitch streamers maintain popularity and income while staying online as much as possible. But this is not as magical as it seems. The most popular Fortnite streamer, Tyler Blevins, nicknamed Ninja, once complained that he had been offline for 48 hours and had lost 40,000 Twitch subscribers. In particular, because of this, some streamers conduct marathon broadcasts - this is a dangerous and common practice, according to which streamers play for more than a day in a row to occupy all time zones and appear on the camera as much as possible. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Most streams take a lot of energy,” says Rinaudo. - And this stream was the exact opposite. It was very easy to lead. It really was a great break in my usual routine when I play games all day. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before falling asleep on camera, Rinaudo admitted to the audience that he was suffering from anxiety. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because of this, his sleep was disturbed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“We will make one sleepy stream, and only one,” he said. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Are you here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'm tired. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I barely hold on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I need a nap. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, I will sleep. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I had a very long day.
