<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Without exaggeration, the unique project ‚ÄúSea Launch‚Äù was born from a combination of many factors. In the early 90s, the Baikonur cosmodrome ended up in independent Kazakhstan, and in possible political upheavals in Russia, problems with launching missiles from it could begin. Secondly, in the USSR, a highly automated launch was designed for the Cyclone rocket in the late 60s, and when the development of the new Zenit launch vehicle began, concepts for launching it from the ship appeared before the first launch. Thirdly, the spread of satellite television has made the geostationary orbit commercially attractive, which makes it much more profitable to launch a satellite from the equator, rather than northern Russian spaceports. And fourthly, Russia in the 90s did not have money for independent implementation of the project.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1993, the head of RSC Energia, Yuri Semenov, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">established</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> contacts with the Boeing company. The prospects looked very attractive, in addition, the Odyssey drilling platform was successfully found in Vyborg, and already on November 25, 1993 RSC Energia, Boeing and the Norwegian company Kvaerner Maritime, the owner of the platform, signed the first agreement on the joint development of the offshore spaceport. Boeing provided finance, organization and marketing, Energia provided rocket, integration and an acceleration block (when they decided on Zenit in 1994, the Ukrainian Yuzhmash participating in its creation appeared in cooperation), and the Norwegians provided a platform. When the Sea Launch was officially born in 1995, the shares were distributed respectively: Boeing 40%, RKKE 25%, Kvaerner 20%, Yuzhmash 15%.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Already in December, a major customer of launch services, Hughes, placed the first order. In 1996, Hughes ordered three more launches, and Space Systems / Loral - five. The first launches were expected in 1998. In 1997, the Norwegian stage of the conversion of the drilling platform into a launch site was completed, and the control ship was launched. The following year, both ships went to the project base in Long Beach, California. Of course, there were some problems, from damage to the launch by a crane falling on the transition to the storm to the suspension of a special permit from the US State Department for Boeing to participate in the project. But the problems were resolved and, with a relatively small delay relative to the plan, on March 27, 1999 the first test satellite went into space. It would seem that the project has a bright future. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The launch complex consists of two ships - a launch platform and a control ship. At the launch site, the rocket floats in the ship, then it is reloaded into a platform hangar. Then people leave the platform, and the automation prepares the rocket: pushes it to the start, sets it upright, refuel, conducts final checks and launches. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even the first accident in 2000 did not cripple optimism. But the first clouds began to appear on the horizon. It turned out that the project costs were significantly higher than expected. Further, in 1997, Boeing took over McDonnell Douglas and became the owner of the Delta launch vehicle family, thus obtaining two competing projects on the balance sheet. If you look at the number of launches by years, we can conclude that by the middle of the zero there was an increase, which, however, was crossed out by the 2007 accident.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The cause of the accident was the engine failure in the fourth second due to a foreign object in the turbopump. A powerful explosion did not cause serious damage to the platform, but undermined the belief in the reliability of the project. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Hughes customer company switched to European Arian 5, but it was not possible to attract new customers. After the accident, a surge in launches is visible - the completion of already signed contracts, and then a sharp failure.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/ij/6d/owij6dc0sn5_ptnzop82xssoiwu.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Underestimation of project costs and insufficiently high profit led to the fact that in 2009, Sea Launch filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, which provides for the reorganization of the company. As a result of the reorganization, RSC Energia with a 95% stake became the new owner. But, alas, it was no longer possible to return the former starting activity. The next decade brought only new blows to the project. In 2013, due to a failure of an on-board power source of the first stage (a hydraulic unit that ensures the rotation of the nozzles of the first stage engine), the launch of the Intelsat 27 satellite ended in an accident. Ukrainian events in 2014 made cooperation extremely difficult. In the same year, Yuzhmash halted the production of launch vehicles. And in 2016, Boeing seized $ 322 million as a share of its investment in the project. Last, 36 launch, ‚ÄúSea Launch‚Äù completed May 26, 2014.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And against this background, in September 2016, news appears about the purchase of Sea Launch by S7. In order to understand the riskiness of the solution, I will give a brief result of the previous paragraphs about the history of the project. S7 did not buy a business ready for work and profit, but a project literally hung with problems. The Sea Launch actually did not have a rocket - Zenit production had to be resumed. There were no orders - the flow of customers went shallow ten years before. The launch services market itself has changed, and it would be very optimistic to expect that Sea Launch, which had not set economic records before, would be able to compete with the SpaceX market share that had seized the old players.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2017, S7 Space acted as the launch operator for the Angosat satellite, but according to rumors from the forums, its participation was to attract Ukrainian specialists to bypass the sanctions. Now, four years after the purchase, we are witnessing the final chords of the tragedy. In 2019, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">it turned out</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that the contract for the production of components for 12 Zenit (70% of parts - Russia, 30% - Ukraine) was canceled. But there is no alternative rocket for the Sea Launch - the Soyuz-5 theoretically suitable in size is under development and will not fly in the coming years. The Angara would require a major redesign of the launch, but it is only getting ready to return to flight after testing in 2014. And against this background, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">complaints</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the unexpectedly high cost of basing in Russia is especially not affected by anything, and the April news about the freezing of the project could not become a sensation. It is not known whether Rosatom will buy the ships of the project, and, if so, what will re-equip them with, but hoping for the resurrection of the Sea Launch would be too optimistic. It is normal that Roscosmos </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">calculates the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> economic efficiency of the conversion of the complex to Soyuz-7 (the Soyuz-5 option specifically for the Sea Launch), but attractive numbers are unlikely to be obtained there.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From an engineering point of view, it was a wonderful complex, but it seems that the politics and economy that generated the Sea Launch killed him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the answer to the question ‚Äúcould the project become successful‚Äù lies rather in this plane. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it was possible to start launches even earlier and at the same time not to go much beyond the initial budget, be able to attract customers and not lose them in preventable accidents, as well as maintain the cooperation of the participating countries, maybe then Sea Launch would find its niche in the market .</font></font></div>
