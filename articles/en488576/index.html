My name is Ashot Hovakimyan, I am the co-founder and creative director of the Armenian advertising agency Zuck &amp; Berg, we briefly call ourselves ‚ÄúTsuk‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are young, full of energy and ideas, we have become famous thanks to approaches that go beyond the framework of the sometimes strict Armenian mentality.</font></font><br>

<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A calendar that no one will throw away</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A calendar is a useful thing, but in the era of gadgets, few people need it, it is easier to look into a smartphone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the calendar donated by the bank has even less chance to stay in the client‚Äôs house, at best, it will gather dust somewhere in the corner until the first spring cleaning when it is discovered and thrown away. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So the idea came to combine business with pleasure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who raises a hand to throw away a wall calendar that holds 4 convenient and stylish eco-bags from recycled kraft paper? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, no one, everyone comes of age when you start to appreciate and collect packages.</font></font><br>

<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Save the planet, or at least Armenia</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From January 1, 2022, Armenia will completely ban the use of plastic bags. In the meantime, the rejection of plastic and the transition to alternative options is being actively promoted by the authorities. Recently, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan published a photo from the supermarket, which shows how he and his wife are packing in cloth bags. The initiative is good, but has not yet received a great response among the population. People are more likely to pack purchases, previously wrapped in polyethylene, in a small plastic bag, and then put it all in a large general plastic bag. It‚Äôs especially difficult for the generation of the 60s to abandon plastic, because this invention of their youth, which changed a lot in their usual way of life, made it easier to solve many problems. And then suddenly the younger generation claims that plastic is bad, that it is killing the planet.It's hard to put up with this. Armenia, like any developing country, solves more pressing problems and so far has little concern for the environment. According to some studies, plastic waste in Armenia makes up more than 30% of household waste, and more precisely, 3000 tons of plastic bags are used and thrown away in the country annually. Our task was to convey to people that the future of the planet is in our hands, and everyone can change something by force, but we must start from ourselves.that the future of the planet is in our hands, and everyone can change something, but we must start with ourselves.that the future of the planet is in our hands, and everyone can change something, but we must start with ourselves.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A bit of information that everyone knows, but do not worry</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And so, everyone knows that getting into the environment, plastic bags are stored for a long time and are not biodegradable, as a result of which they cause stable environmental pollution.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The average shelf life of plastic bags is 10-15 minutes, and for decomposition in nature they require more than 100-400 years.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> About 300 million tons of plastic are produced annually in the world, a significant part of which is more than 600 billion plastic bags.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The volume of plastic in the oceans is 6 times the volume of plankton.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the soil, depending on the region, the plastic is 4-20 times more than in the water.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Microplastic particles have been detected even in the Arctic.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fearfully? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fearfully! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But how often do we remember this? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Less often than necessary.</font></font><br>

<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About the calendar: process, appearance, success</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The calendar in Armenian is called ‚Äúoratsuyts‚Äù, where ‚Äúop‚Äù is the day, ‚Äútsuyts‚Äù is shown. But the word ‚Äútsuyts‚Äù is also translated as a demonstration, a protest. We decided to use a pun, and we got ‚ÄúORACUITS against plastic‚Äù, i.e. calendar protest. Already not bad. The technical part turned out to be the most difficult: how to fit 4 medium-sized packets into a wall calendar? With difficulties. The whole team worked on the project - 20 people, more than 4 months. Designers managed to develop a calendar concept with 4 packages in such a way that it was functional, practical, stylish and convenient. The next problem was that no printing house in the country undertook to print such a project. After long negotiations, we managed to persuade one printing house, and at the cost of numerous fails we still managed to realize the idea.The first batch flew like hot cakes: 12,000 calendars got into the homes of not only the bank's customers, but also those who were interested in the idea, anyone could go to the bank and get their own sample. 4 packages for 4 seasons of the year is a kind of challenge, an opportunity to check whether you can last 3 months with one package. With careful use, this is quite possible, I say from personal experience.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are not greedy, ready to share</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The project was born as a commercial one, because there is a bank logo on the calendar and packages, but we want to make it social, because it is based on an important idea for us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And these are not empty words, we live like that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We managed to minimize the use of plastic, we abandoned so many familiar things, we do not have plastic bags, glasses, pens in the office ...</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our calendar idea is not patented in any way, it is in the public domain. Everyone can go to the landing page linked to the bank‚Äôs website and download the file for the calendar‚Äôs typography absolutely free. Any company can set its own logo on the layout and print similar calendars from recycled paper for itself. It is important for us that our idea win as many minds as possible. And it‚Äôs not a matter of empty vanity or the desire to keep up with eco-trends and hype on the topic of Greta Tunberg. We are really concerned, if not with the state of the entire planet, then certainly with the future of our country, we still have to live and raise children here. As adults and responsible people, we understand that this future is directly dependent on our actions today. One paper bag, one unrejected cup, one raised cigarette butt,one planted tree can improve or save someone‚Äôs life, and if you multiply this by 7.7 billion, then the whole planet.</font></font></div>
