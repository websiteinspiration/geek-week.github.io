 <blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10 years ago, Steve Jobs went on stage to introduce the iPad to the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By his own admission, the tablet has become a device from the third category between a smartphone and a laptop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, netbooks dominated the personal computer sector ... Apple had its own answer to netbooks: a 9.7-inch tablet that allowed the owner to access the Internet ... the iPad was designed to be more convenient for music, games, browsing, email, photos, videos and e-books. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIf a third category of devices appears, it will have to surpass a laptop or smartphone in all these tasks - otherwise there is no point in its existence,‚Äù said Jobs.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> After the release of the iPad in 2010, the author of the strategic blog Stratechery posted the following post:</font></font><br>
 <blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/yt/gd/kqytgdjbjwktbfu9wrukxnd6uwy.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most users just want to go to Facebook, check their emails, watch YouTube, and maybe upload photos. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The value of Apple‚Äôs offer for these customers is as follows: iPad offers more convenience than using a PC or netbook to consume content and even create it, which satisfies most users. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's why iWork was featured so often during the presentation - Apple made it clear that the tablet can completely replace the personal computer.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As time goes on, experts are trying to assess whether Jobs's expectations have been met. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">UX designer and creator of Markdown Markup Language John Gruber is disappointed with the current state of the iPad:</font></font><br>
<blockquote>¬´  ,   ,  iPad    .  Mac   ,     :  1984            ,   1994        . iPad      ,           ‚Ä¶   ‚Äî   iPad. <a name="habracut"></a>   iPadOS   ,   iPhone,   -  Apple       ,   Mac.  iPad  ,   .     ¬ª.</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IPad has big problems with multitasking. She ruined the device interface. Now I absolutely don‚Äôt like working with the iPad [approx. Ed .: The article describes the opinion of the author of the original text]. I use it only for watching videos and sketching articles. What is striking and even tragic is how the iPad came to its current state. During the first demonstration of the device, Jobs sat with the tablet, leaning back in his chair - a great way to show that the device is designed to consume content. However, then it seemed that the iPad had more potential. Here is what I wrote ten years ago:</font></font><br>
<blockquote>¬´        ‚Äî        ,     iPad     .  ,  ,         .     ,  Macintosh¬ª.<br>
<br>
 ,  ,   iWork,    57 . iPad     .       ,      .        . ,     ,     .  : ,   multitouch,        .   ,    ,     iPhone,       .</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I must say right away that now my twelve-year-old daughter does not really use a mouse. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She has a laptop, but she prefers a touchpad. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, a year later, when Steve Jobs showed the iPad 2 to the world in his penultimate presentation, the future I described seemed right. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most impressive moment of his performance was the GarageBand demonstration. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here's the full video of the presentation, but its most important part is Steve Jobs‚Äôs reaction to GarageBand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rewind to 12:30 if there is no time or desire to watch completely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jobs's goggle speaks more than his words:</font></font><br>
<br>
<div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</font></font><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/eIEJHIHU/steve-jobs-garageband-for-ipad-introduction_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am shocked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone can play their own or virtual instruments and create music on such a thin device that weighs only 601 grams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is unbelievable ... This is not a toy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is what you can use to do real work.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GarageBand was even more important than iWork, which was released a year earlier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such an application could only be presented on the iPad. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although there was a program on the Mac with the same name, there was practically nothing in common between them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then Jobs died, and since then I have not been able to get rid of the feeling that the special vision of the iPad went with him.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Missing iPad ecosystem</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the end of the GarageBand presentation, something happened that made it possible to predict future iPad problems back then: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bx/av/kk/bxavkkzgeapj45qrmpcco66iszw.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seems to me that the iPad is the product that Steve Jobs lacks the most. Nevertheless, third-party developers should have become a long-term and sustainable source of innovation for the tablet. Take a look at the example of Gruber with the popularity of Mac among graphic designers and illustrators. While Apple MacPaint demonstrated the capabilities of the device, Aldus (PageMaker), Quark (QuarkXPress) and Adobe (Illustrator, Photoshop, Acrobat) made a real revolution. By the time the Mac was ten years old, Apple was a $ 2 billion company, and Adobe was worth $ 1 billion.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Needless to say, there is not one equally large company that has succeeded thanks to the iPad - despite the fact that the general addressable market has expanded. One of the main reasons is the price of the application ($ 4.99). Apple set the standard according to which extremely sophisticated, innovative software, which could only appear on the iPad, brought in only $ 5 from each customer (updates, of course, were free). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This remains one of Apple's biggest mistakes. In 2015, when the company first launched the iPad Pro, in my article ‚ÄúFrom Products to Platforms,‚Äù I wrote:</font></font><br>
 <blockquote>¬´    iPad,    Apple .     ¬´     ,      ,   ¬ª.  ‚Äî  ,     .   iPad    ,  ‚Äî ,     ,     .   ,        ‚Äî  ,      iPad,  Apple.   ¬´ ¬ª,    .<br>
<br>
,    ,    iPad    ,   .  Apple     ‚Äî     .      SDK   App Store.       -,     ,  ¬´ ¬ª   .<br>
<br>
   iOS   .    ,     iPhone.      (  ,    ),        ,   ‚Äî      .     iPad     iPhone. ,     (  ).<br>
<br>
  ,     iPad   ‚Äî , Paper.         .       , ,  ,   .    FiftyThree            Pencil (       Apple).   Apple  Garageband  iMovie ,   ¬ª.</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since then, the situation has improved a bit, primarily due to the addition of subscriptions to applications. However, for users, this system seems significantly less profitable compared to a model that has supported Mac developers for decades (pay for a new version of the program). Previously, we never had to pay extra to get access to all the functionality of a paid application.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Instead, as Apple usually does, it tried to solve the problem on its own by turning the iPad into a degraded Mac. Therefore, Gruber is disappointed in multitasking, which not only causes problems for users, but also increases the complexity of developing applications. All this makes the chances of making a profit from the application for the iPad even less. The most successful companies creating sophisticated iPad apps are Microsoft and Adobe, which have their own subscription models.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Frankly, no one would have abandoned such "failures" that the iPad has undergone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last fiscal year, the tablet brought the company $ 21 billion - almost as much as the Mac ($ 26 billion). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's why I do not call it a failure: the tragedy of the iPad is not that it sold poorly, but that it did not and most likely never reaches its potential, which ten years ago seemed huge. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And what do you think: does the iPad concept justify its existence in 2020?</font></font></div>
