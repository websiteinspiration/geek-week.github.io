Very often, the most brilliant and talented people have the biggest problems, and nowhere is this more pronounced than in the field of entrepreneurship. With each such premature death, the problem of mental health briefly falls into the focus of public attention ... However, attention is paid exactly as long as the standard news release lasts, and nothing changes ... But the time for chatter has passed and it is time to take serious action. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The epidemic of mental illness is a reality. This year, 18.5% of the population suffers from mental illness. And 4% of them experience such severe problems that they are unable </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to live their lives normally</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . And this means that it is likely that you or someone you know is experiencing suffering and needs support right now.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Moreover, unlike many of the problems that we face today, most of the mental disorders (depression, anxiety, addiction, etc.) may well be solved by the application of human effort. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We not only have to do something, but we can do something. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To date, the statistics of mental illness does not inspire optimism and looks especially terrifying for entrepreneurs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">studies by Michael Freeman</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , entrepreneurs are 50% more likely to report mental problems, and a number of diseases are found in businessmen several times more often than other people. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Businessmen:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2 times more likely to suffer from depression</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6 times more likely to suffer from ADHD</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3 times more likely to suffer from addictions</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10 times more likely to suffer from bipolar disorder</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2 times more often hospitalized</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2 times more likely to have suicidal tendencies</font></font></li>
</ul><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/375/01b/296/37501b296a0223d542c33356c9664a04.png" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Resolving an impending psychological catastrophe in the field of entrepreneurship should become a moral imperative, and a wise investor should consider this as one of the functions of his business. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Venture capitalists make money from the tears, blood, and sweat of entrepreneurs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although it is thanks to their efforts that we get this or that result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can continue to consider them as a means of achieving the goal, or treat them like people. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And when I try to do this: I try to understand the identity of entrepreneurs and watch them constantly struggle, I can not remain untouched. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Seeing their business successes is just as important to me as getting my own results. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Michael Freeman writes</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> :</font></font><br>
<blockquote>        21 ,  -         . , , , , ,              .</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And depression, anxiety and mood disorders - all this actively undermines their performance. They often contribute to burnout, cofounder conflict, toxic corporate culture, increased staff turnover, inability to hire the best talents, inability to “show up” at important meetings and pitches, and poor decision making in general. According to Noam Wasserman of HBS, 65% of unsuccessful startups fail for reasons that could have been avoided, for example due to a conflict of co-founders. All these problems are exacerbated when the founders are in a state of intense mental and emotional stress.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's assume that in a portfolio of 20 companies, 15 of them fail or fall behind, and that Noam Wasserman's statistics are 65 percent correct. This would mean that 10 out of 15 companies (65 percent) failed for completely predictable “human” reasons. If we were able to help at least half of these companies avoid the failures caused by burnout and mental stress, this would mean that another five companies would be successful, doubling the number of successful results in the portfolio.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And even if you change the strategy for one of ten companies you will already win. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, supporting startups before their “problems with people” become business problems provides a 20 percent improvement in productivity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if you are indifferent to the personal life of an entrepreneur, you should still take care of him, because he cares about the profitability of your portfolio. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And, of course, such statements sound great, but words are not enough and we must act.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do entrepreneurs suffer much more acutely?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mental health problems pervade all sectors, not just entrepreneurship, but the above </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">statistics</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> seem to indicate that it is in business that the problem manifests itself most clearly. What is the reason? It is difficult to clearly answer this question, and soon modern research will help us identify these factors. At the moment, based on our own observations of entrepreneurs, we believe that there are several explanations. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Self-selection.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Most of the founders are smart, motivated and experienced people, whose resume can allow them to provide for themselves (for example, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">average salary</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Facebook $ 240,000). But they still choose a more creative and creative and at the same time more exhausting and uncertain path. These people are almost certainly predisposed to certain conditions (e.g., ADHD). In his book, The Da Vinci Method, Garret Loporto </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">quoted</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Fortune magazine claiming that people with ADHD are 300% more likely to create their own company than others. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Poisonous industrial trails.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The stories that our industry tells us look less real than the covers of fashion magazines, however, they are no less destructive. Photographed photos of “ideal people” create an unattainable standard of beauty; and likewise, a steady stream of stories of “success” create an unattainable standard for businessmen.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Startups are hard.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The magic of teamwork is that people's skills complement each other. Only here, at the beginning of their activity, entrepreneurs have no team and they have to do everything themselves. Work on projects that do not fit in with the leader’s innate skills usually drains him emotionally. In an early startup, introverts in a company often have to come up with promotional offers, while extroverts are forced to sit at a table and work in CRM. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Startups cause alienation.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The inclusive nature of a startup often forces entrepreneurs to spend less time with family, friends, and significant other people, and many of them are forced to move away from these support groups for financial or strategic reasons. As stress builds up in the company, entrepreneurs are increasingly investing in work and increasing their efforts (a natural reaction to an emergency). This trend only further burdens the entrepreneur, drowning their supportive relationships and reducing their ability to cope with company pressure. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An entrepreneur must be a rock.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The founder is constantly under tremendous pressure from the company and its problems. As a result, he is often alone when he really needs support. Often, the founders report that they are not able to discuss the problem with the co-founders (especially if this problem concerns them specifically). They cannot delegate their problems to subordinates, and they feel that their friends and family do not understand them and do not want to hear about the company again. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Syndrome "I - this is my company."</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Entrepreneurs often blur the boundaries between themselves and their companies, as a result of which the failure of the enterprise is felt as their own failure. And the loss of a client or receiving a refusal from an investor can be perceived as a personal rejection. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The boss eats last.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have not yet met an entrepreneur who has a budget article for personal care or who takes a vacation without feeling guilty. In almost every other qualified industry, there is recognition that people have the right to take care of themselves and that a little care of themselves actually leads to a more productive workforce. But investors, entrepreneurs, and poorly trained mid-level managers — they all perpetuate the myth in startup history that the only way to succeed is to inexorably grind oneself to the bone.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Financial risks. In addition to opportunity costs, founders are often left without a salary and invest a significant portion of their personal capital in their business. This creates tremendous financial stress and anxiety, based on a scenario in which a failure in business also leads to personal financial collapse. Some involvement in the business can play a positive role, but the founders are often completely emotionally connected with their business. And in this case, the entrepreneur seems to live all the time under the sword of Damocles, which makes him concentrate on risks, and this only leads to poor results. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Imposter Syndrome.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Entrepreneurs often suffer from the feeling that they do not have a place where they are, and that in the end they will be exposed as scammers. This makes them write off any success for good luck, but take all the blame for any problems on themselves. Indeed, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">58% of technical workers</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> suffer from impostor syndrome, and I suspect this number is significantly higher among entrepreneurs. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plank to heaven.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It is difficult for entrepreneurs to celebrate small victories, as each victory brings the next, more serious challenge. And experiencing maximum stress now, next time it will only be even greater. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dependencies.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our industry is flooded with alcohol and other substances that, according to the tacit opinion of society, are a good way to solve all their problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And very often, for entrepreneurs and managers, alcohol becomes the only way to deal with the transcendental stresses they experience in the enterprise. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I bet even a simple reading of this list made you feel yourself in the shoes of an entrepreneur and realize the whole burden that lay on his shoulders. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fortunately, there are ways to deal with the mental problems of entrepreneurs.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What can investors and entrepreneurs do to protect their mental health?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Each of us who is at least somehow involved in the topic of startups makes a contribution to the problem of mental health of entrepreneurs. But this should only make us make this contribution positive and here are a few ways to do it. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Destigamization.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Investors must make sure that the founders with whom they work know that their mental problems are taken seriously. One way to do this is to take on the so-called investment commitment </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">developed by Erin Frey and Ti Jao at Kip</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, which involves the creation of a workspace for mental health. Just by making a commitment, we can already show entrepreneurs that it is quite normal to seek help. Even better, if investors, interacting with the founders, speak directly about support on their part, as well as help in finding psychiatric services if necessary. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stop pretending.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Being an investor is not like being a founder, but it is also not easy and investors also have many problems. If investors want to support entrepreneurs, they must be honest and open to them. They must show that it is normal to open up and trust, and normal to have mental problems. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Entrepreneurs should also not reinforce standard myths.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you work on your business for years in an anonymity environment and then make a major breakthrough, make sure that your PR campaign accurately reflects your efforts. You suffered to lead your company to the pinnacle of success, and you had to invest heavily in yourself in order to survive along the way. Make sure that when other founders read about your success, they understand how you actually got there. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Provide resources.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People easily forget how serious a financial burden the founders of companies bear. Just because they have earned five million from a recent deal does not necessarily mean that they have personal capital to seek help and support. Part of the financial resources should be reserved for the founders themselves and investors. Investors should also consider entrepreneurs as a direction of investment: in their health and development. Founders should include in their financial statements a line of products for healing or personal care. Budgets are moral documents that determine the priorities of a company. If there is no position to support the mental / physical / emotional well-being of the founders and employees, then the company will be deprived of resources to provide this kind of support. We,participants in this ecosystem should invest in those areas that we are constantly talking about when we declare that we are "friendly to the founders" and "invest in entrepreneurs in the first place."</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not forget about the connection of the psyche-body.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Mental, emotional and physical well-being are all deeply connected to each other. Just as mental health problems often lead to substance abuse, lack of exercise or nutrition can also lead to depressed mood and lack of focus. Entrepreneurs should be sure to incorporate their physical activity of choice into their lives, they should monitor their diet and should consider activities such as yoga, meditation and deliberate breathing, which, as </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">studies show</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , help to increase mood, focus attention and increase emotional stability. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communications, communications, communications.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Founders must remain tied to the support network. They must join a peer group, chat with old friends, date their soulmate, and make new friends. This is not only a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">good way</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> to relieve some of the pressure they are experiencing, but also a great reminder that they exist separately from their company. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Managers should take vacations away from work and business.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> If the founder can not voluntarily disconnect even during the holidays, he should think about joining a community or about how to force himself to fence himself off from everyday troubles. Few people notice a person’s burnout when reading an obituary, however, a trained eye understands its effect. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Create a culture that supports self-care.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If everyone, from the secretary to the CEO, is ready to seek help and take care of themselves, this creates a corporate habit that allows everyone to flourish. A healthy culture will pay for itself a thousand times by recruiting staff, reducing staff turnover and happier, more productive people who will be ready to sacrifice themselves for the company when necessary. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Set priorities, not tasks.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Type A founders and personalities tend to live and die according to their calendar and task lists. Unfortunately, task lists are simply reminders that there are countless things to do. For most of us, our task lists are literally endless. This is a recipe for unbearable mental stress and uncontrollable cognitive load. The definition of anxiety is when we realize that our ability to achieve is suppressed by the tasks before us, which is inevitable when our tasks are poorly defined, too large, or seem endless. Instead of a task list, switch to a daily priority list that lists only urgent and important items. Completing these points may be more difficult, but deleting them from the list brings much more satisfaction.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Be carefull. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Examine the symptoms of depression and burnout. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People who drown, do not wave their hands in the air and do not shout for help, they glide silently under the waves, and only trained rescuers tend to notice people in distress. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same thing happens with depression. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Depressive people do not mope, and they are not necessarily sad, but rather numb. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here are some things to look out for:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Persistent sense of pessimism</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sad, anxious, or empty mood</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Behavioral changes and loss of interest in previously favorite activities</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Change in diet or meal schedule</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Change sleep schedule</font></font></li>
