<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">General impressions of remote work</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the time that has passed since the last article was published, I read reviews and collected information from colleagues regarding the experience gained in organizing remote work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The share of companies that do not plan to return to offices is growing in direct proportion to the time elapsed since everyone switched to remote work. If you extrapolate this trend, you can understand that the future lies in remote work. As positive examples of companies that, already now, understand and accept the introduction of remote work, you can cite: Mail ru - until September; Qiwi - until September; Avito - until September; T-Systems - until September; Dino Systems - until September; tutu ru - completely switched to udalenka; CityMobile - for an indefinite period; Oracle - for an indefinite period; RedCode - completely on the remote; Alfa Bank - until the new year; lamoda until September; Facebook - until the end of the year; Google - until the end of the year; Twitter forever; Discovery Channel until September. MSU plans to teach students completely remotely in the new academic year.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many companies, especially international ones, before switching to remote work, arranged their work processes in such a way that remote work is no different for them from office work. Examples of successful organization of remote work include RUSAL, Severstal, Mars, Sberbank, Alfa Bank, which had a good backlog for the transition to remote work, which they have now further strengthened both in terms of technology and in terms of processes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most of the employees ( </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">according to a survey conducted by hh in May 2020 - 65%</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ) are sure that working remotely is much more convenient and efficient than in the office. The exception is those who have a small living area and who are prevented from working by frequent distractions from family members (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">according to a survey conducted by hh in May 2020 - 47%</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Managers and owners of such enthusiasm neither share. Many, for the present, plan to return to work in the office. Among the problems identified by managers are a drop in productivity ( </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">according to a survey conducted by hh in May 2020 - 65%</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ), lack of coordination </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">among the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> teams ( </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">according to a survey conducted by hh in May 2020 - 40%</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ), a decrease in the quality of work ( </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">by According to a survey conducted by hh in May 2020 - 30%</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ), increasing the complexity of control, the loss of the overall picture of the work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In our life there have already been many events that have caused serious and irreversible changes, and many more such events will be. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Often, we get used to living in a new reality, forgetting about what events shaped it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, until 2011 it was normal to smoke in an office, and now no one even remembers that once there were times when people smoked in offices. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We will talk about the importance of processes, requirements for managers, an administrative management system, and some nuances that need special attention when working remotely.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Using a single conceptual apparatus and methodology for organizing work</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During remote work, the amount of interference and distortion in the communication channels is growing significantly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If, at the same time, several people exchange information at the same time, or people of different cultures, peoples, education or values, the problems become even greater. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When working in one office, this is decided by the fact that you can come up and talk, draw on paper or a board, in extreme cases, ask another to help translate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When working remotely, all of these solutions are not available, and you must use other tools. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main things to start the systematization of the conceptual apparatus:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a single knowledge base with a simple and understandable structure, which is constantly updated and updated;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">availability of regulations and instructions on how to resolve typical issues, if something is not clear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Better if, the development of regulations and instructions will start the head, and then, you can pass on to others;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the presence of a management culture in which people are not afraid to ask questions when they arise, and the leader is open.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All this requires from the head:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">maintain an open relationship in a team;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">spend time on putting communications in order, training employees, developing knowledge bases and guidance documents.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You can start, for example, by creating a common glossary, which is initially filled out by the head, and then. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">complement and support employees.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Availability of collaboration tools</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As you know, the most effective is communication on a whiteboard with markers, in the presence of the whole team. In the context of remote work, we lose this communication method. It is necessary to compensate for this loss. This applies not only to discussions of architecture issues in the project team. It may also be necessary to see, show or do together during the transfer of knowledge between team members, user training, or simply helping users.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I spoke in detail about the technical side of remote work in a previous article. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I‚Äôll add that for remote work the whole team will need a seinban - boards, tools for joint drawing (such as Zoom allows) and programs for remote access to desktops to each other in order to be able to show or display something visually. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previously, security blocked such tools. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now it will be necessary to allow them to be used in order to increase efficiency.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tools for displaying the current state of affairs</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the course of joint work in the same room, the person, and especially the leader, in any case, is aware of the state of affairs - he heard, saw, asked, clarified. With some assumptions, even without dashboards, serious problems appear and become noticeable. In a situation where everyone works remotely, and in different places, these channels for receiving information disappear. And, there is a chance of being in a situation where it becomes completely unclear where we are, in general, and what is happening. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To understand the current state of affairs, to identify trends and prevent deviations, means of individual and group reporting are necessary, at least:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>  ,         .               ;</li>
<li>   ,    ,      ;</li>
<li>    ,  ,           ,       ,    .</li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The listed tools serve as the basis for regular meetings, but in no way replace them. Most importantly, you don‚Äôt have to do reporting for the sake of reporting and dashboards and overload employees. Most tasks can be solved in elementary spreadsheets, rather than installing bulky trackers for this, and spending time learning how to work with them. In this case, the structure and understanding of the process are primary, not the tool. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Usually, I will organize the reporting process as follows. Employees keep track of the lowest level tracker, in terms of tasks and performers. Based on this tracker, I, automatically (with scripts or in a simple database), collect beautiful reports on top-level tasks and the employees who analyze.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ability to attract remote employees in the regions</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Remote work has opened up unprecedented economic opportunities for employers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To work in the office, it was necessary either to attract employees in the city where the office was located, or to open an office in the city where the employees were located. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, offices were opened only in large cities with high labor costs and office maintenance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now there is no need to open an office, and it is possible to attract remote workers from the regions, the average wage in which is lower than in the metropolises. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, employees from regions have higher motivation to work remotely in large companies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This should help increase or at least maintain the profitability of the business, as well as increase the uniformity of distribution of qualified people across the regions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, it does not matter where the employees performing the control function are located. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To save them, you can also transfer to the regions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Legal support for remote work</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To minimize possible risks, it is necessary to modify and renew agreements with remotely working employees and other regulatory documents of the company. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I will leave a deep study of this topic to HR specialists and lawyers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I‚Äôll simply indicate that for productive remote work, you may need to make adjustments to regulatory and legal documents. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, to normalize the time of availability or sanctions for not answering a phone call within a certain time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The difference between free schedule and remote work</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the absence of fixed and approved agreements, each of the parties interprets all not clearly fixed points in its favor. One of such moments is the presence at the workplace, and the execution of work during working hours, when working from home. In addition, often, the concept of "remote work" is replaced by the concept of "work on a free schedule." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Earlier, I came across such manifestations during episodic work of employees from home, and now managers are massively paying attention to this. It looks like this - the employee does not answer the call, does not read mail, misses appointments, and generally does the work at the wrong time. In response to legitimate questions, you get the answer ‚Äúwell, I did everything until 23:59,‚Äù ‚Äúwell, I did everything until 08:00 the next day‚Äù ... (the list goes on and on).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To minimize problems with the substitution of the concept of remote work with the concept of work on a free schedule, they should be regulated and clearly divided. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You need to pronounce this when applying for a job, when transferring to a remote job and regularly as you forget. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, these are the tasks of the leader.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Access time regulation</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even when working in the office, not everyone came on time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On one of my projects, employees could come to work in the interval from 07:00 to 11:00. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, there were 2 limitations:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The employee should have been present at all the meetings at which he is required, regardless of the time they started. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here, the person had many options: agree with everyone about reschedule the meeting, connect by phone, come to the meeting at the designated time.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Together with the employee, we designated "time of guaranteed presence" = the time when the employee is 100% at work and available for contact. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The time of guaranteed presence of employees was communicated to the entire project team and the Customer.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For remote employees, we need a clear regulation of all manifestations of the presence of an employee at work, at least this:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">recording and publishing guaranteed availability time;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fixing the time interval during which you need to respond to the letter;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fixing the time interval during which it is necessary to answer an unanswered phone call;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fixing and regulation of liability and sanctions for failure to comply with the paragraphs above.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The listed requirements should be fixed in agreements with employees, regulatory documents of the company level and work regulations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is incumbent on the manager to communicate the restrictions to employees, to coordinate, if necessary, control the implementation and incentive measures in case of deviations.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mechanisms for accounting and compensation for violations and errors</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To help employees comply with the working conditions described above, additional incentive elements will be required that will reduce the risks of employee irregularities in the performance of their duties. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now there are simple concepts of ‚Äúnot going to work,‚Äù which are stipulated in the Labor Code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And how to fix not going to work when a person, in principle, goes nowhere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is why it is necessary to process legal documents and corporate regulations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In any case, it‚Äôs better not to punish people for a violation, but not to help them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This requires clarification, prevention and control. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Which, in turn, will require increased involvement and control by the leader.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Spyware Control Methods</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Against the background of remote work, advertising of espionage tools and methodologies for monitoring employees intensified. Screenshots, pictures through a video camera, fixing all actions and other dead man switches. Some providers offer to record the entire working day of an employee, and then view it with the help of a separate employee. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These tools were used before the introduction of remote work. There are cases when managers monitored the work of employees through a video camera. True, I did not see any analytics about the effectiveness, and there couldn‚Äôt be any, since it rather amuses the ego of an individual person, but does not give an increase, but rather the opposite.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my opinion, their use indicates the desire of the head to imitate the work, and not organize it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The work of the leader involves planning work based on the available resource of employees, understanding who and what is doing at the moment, and issuing corrective feedback. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the manager is not able to provide proper management, it is necessary to study and implement more effective management methods and tools. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, the use of such tools does not increase the confidence of employees in the organization as a whole and can cause a reciprocal desire to work less. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus, it can affect the attractiveness of the organization for people if the labor market swings in the opposite direction.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hybrid work format</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The hybrid format is available in two variations:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Employees who by their role cannot work remotely work in the office, the rest work remotely.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone works remotely, and they come to the office only for meetings and work for which a presence is required.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now a lot of hope is assigned to the second format. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don‚Äôt really believe in him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since people will get used to working from home most of the time, and the road to the office will create an additional negative that will destroy the benefits of temporary presence in the office.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Using remote work as an incentive</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Previously, remote work was often used as an incentive, for example, the ability to work remotely while maintaining high quality or increasing productivity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now you can use remote work as an incentive of a different kind - reducing payment, provided that remote work is preserved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Benefits for the employee, in this case, will be: saving time on the road, saving on transportation and food, the ability to live anywhere. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Work in the office, with a hybrid format of work, can be considered as a negative incentive in the case of poor quality work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this sense, a hybrid work format can greatly help, if only by the availability of the opportunity to return an employee to the office in case of unsatisfactory results.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regular face-to-face communication</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A competently arranged process of work and reporting allows you to receive information on possible deviations from reports in a timely manner. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, when working remotely, it is important that the supervisor personally communicate with the staff on work issues. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I pay special attention to the fact that:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">it is necessary to communicate with everyone, and not just with those with common non-working interests;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to discuss work, not personal issues.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During these conversations, it is possible to identify and resolve emerging issues and engage in employee development. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For large teams, I usually use this schedule of meetings:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Daily general meetings, like SCRUM rally, with the whole team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During them, it is advisable to disassemble the general and typical difficulties that may be of interest to the whole team.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Separate meetings, throughout the day, with employees who have identified difficulties that do not require general discussion.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once a week meetings with employees who, in principle, have no difficulties, to confirm that everything is really good and the development of employees.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Holding such meetings is an important component of the work of the leader. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When working in the office, it was possible to replace meetings with one-time communication on abstract topics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now this will not work and the lack of regular meetings will lead to serious problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If, instead of holding regular meetings, the manager analyzes the current state of affairs on the basis of reporting, he urgently needs to expand his arsenal of professional competencies.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Housing issue</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Previously, people were forced to move and live near their place of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What made many leave their places of birth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Buying apartments in big cities was not a cheap pleasure, and everyone bought apartments of not large area, in which it is impossible to equip a full-fledged workplace. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the transition to remote work, this problem seriously manifested itself. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Further, while maintaining this trend, people will be able to move to small cities, where they will buy larger apartments in which they can equip a full-fledged workplace. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And people from small cities will get a chance to work remotely and earn a large area apartment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The real estate market is already starting to respond to new conditions.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">findings</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The transition to remote work, first of all, implies a high quality management system and the professional level of a manager. Units will suffer, and the companies whose leaders are conducting a massive struggle with monkeys and running slogans in the style of "well, you are conscious people, you must do everything right, and not that, I will find others in your place." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When working in the office, the absence of a control system can be masked in various ways, which, when working remotely, simply do not exist. Only the leader is responsible for the result and it all depends on his ability to get the result with the help of employees. All the nuances must be planned, fixed and measured.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The involvement of the leader himself and his desire to participate in the process, and not just to observe from the outside, come to the fore. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It takes a lot of time to communicate with employees, to identify and understand issues that are relevant to each person, to understand what is currently worrying for employees. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is necessary to gain experience in monitoring and controlling the situation on the basis of incomplete information, one might say, the intuitive ability to connect to the process exactly when the dynamics are falling. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, some nuances are added that are not too complicated for a professional leader, which we discussed above. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If, in your opinion, something important is not reflected in this article - write in person or in comments - we will discuss it.</font></font><br>
