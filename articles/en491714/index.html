<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Five years ago with one article tag on "Habr√©" the history of UXhot began. Then, with the filing of ‚ÄúBusiness Youth‚Äù, only the lazy did not make landings, and the belief in them was so strong that very soon it was impossible to poke a mouse in an empty place so as not to get into the landing. At the same time, the overwhelming majority of the quality was so low that I wanted to gouge my eyes out from the next countdown timer or megascale. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Article ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To Each on the Landing Page. Sore</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Was a cry of the soul, but at the same time it pursued a specific goal - to show that even the creation of a seemingly simple and primitive landing (but what's so complicated?) Should be accompanied by at least a minimal attempt to understand the characteristics of the business and the needs of the target audience. Once in a painful spot of public indignation, the article very quickly gained a quarter of a million views, was copied a dozen times, received many expert feedback and generated a tight flow of customers for several years to come. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Clients liked my approach to the development of the landing page, so in spite of a very overheated market and exceeding the ‚Äúaverage hospital cost‚Äù of services, they chose me.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In truth, I was not ready for such a rapid development of events. There was no office, there was no team. There was only me - a UX designer with a good technical background, which allowed me at the beginning of the path to close all the stages from designing the interface to layout of the landing myself. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Very soon, the scope of tasks began to exceed capabilities. So the team appeared, and with it the first office - a small, walk-in room subleased by a stagnant outdoor advertising agency. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By delegating visual design and front-end, I focused on the most important, which allowed us to strongly discord with other offers on the market. The process was built in such a way that the UI designer received a ready-made, highly detailed prototype with almost final texts. And I was engaged in its design.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite the prevailing pattern-driven approach in the market, I individually approached each project, paying considerable attention to research and interviews with each of the business participants: from the general director to sales managers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Talking about the actual experience, in the process of in-depth face-to-face interviews, I was able to dive quite deeply into the features of each particular business and extract really important knowledge that formed the basis of the subsequent interface. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This approach allowed us to move more consciously: not blindly copy competitors or implement unnecessary customer wishes, but create truly convenient and useful products for the target audience that effectively solve the required business tasks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Whatever topic we take, be it an SMS-mailing service, a travel agency, smartphone covers, whiskey stones or student assistance, each project turned out to be self-identical and effective. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the landing page for the mechanized plastering service has become almost an </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">industry standard</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that has spawned hundreds of direct and indirect copies.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rapid growth</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quite quickly, we formed a pool of customers who needed more than just a landing page. So we came to the support service. For a guaranteed monthly fee, we systematically continued to work on the development of the project and without realizing it, we turned into a boutique agency. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Wanting to remove the burden of Internet marketing from customers, I wanted to provide a full service from a single window. Therefore, search engine optimization, contextual advertising and crowd marketing were added to the site development service. Our clients could focus on the development of their business without being distracted by the constant debate with various contractors. Many even ceased to be interested in what exactly and how we are doing. The main thing is that there is a result. And he was.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This period was the most entertaining in the history of the company. We moved to a new, spacious office in the business center and grew to ten employees, not including freelance employees. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-z/c0/bj/-zc0bjisqu-ukazmpbkenw5zlqi.png"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first day in the new office right after the repair </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We almost stopped accepting orders for landings, focusing on the development of ongoing projects and the creation of large sites. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the ‚Äúdiscount fever‚Äù, when every first site of plastic windows was full of cruel dumping, we launched ‚ÄúWindows of the Future‚Äù, where, referring to other values, we were able to load the production to its full capacity, and after a while they pulled up the market again, revealing and occupying a completely free segment "Windows without installation."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Strongly lifted the bar by making a new website for HR Solutions Smart Provider, forcing competitors to urgently pull themselves up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Three years have passed since the launch, and the site is still one of the best in the niche, helping the company grow several times from year to year. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We rethought the site of the manufacturer of paint and varnish materials "Element Ukraine", helped to enter the international market contact center Simply Contact, and then another and ten other different companies. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During this development period, I received an offer of investment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A successful serial entrepreneur offered help and money in exchange for a share, but I, being too self-confident, politely refused. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We grew so fast that I simply could not believe in the possibility of failure.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First problems</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Along with growth, the first problems began. The increase in the volume of services and the number of employees created an increased burden on me. As it turned out, I unconsciously egocentered all communication between employees and decision making. This position allowed us to grow rapidly in the beginning, without creating difficulties for several employees, but turned into a real problem with an increase in staff and an increase in the volume of tasks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Realizing the problem, we began to learn to interact and make decisions on our own. This yielded results, but the load was still high. That's because I was still the only person in the company who sold, talked with customers, managed projects and designed interfaces.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Wanting to focus on the development of the company, I tried to delegate UX, but not one of the hired UX designers of various levels has ever come close to what is needed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Being a "narrow neck", from time to time I was the reason for the failure of promising presales or project dates. It was becoming increasingly difficult to monitor the development of the company and the quality of service. More and more thoughts of burnout appeared in my head. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To stop moral stagnation, I changed my eating habits, went to the gym and started learning English. After a while, I managed to fall in love with salads, lose 15 kg and get the Upper-Intermediate level. Energy has noticeably increased. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/qz/fl/xeqzflxiqxdks28npgfo89t3qkg.jpeg"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this photo, I threw off the first 7 kg. As many more to come</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At this time, Alfa-Bank Ukraine launched a competition for the best interface for its mobile banking application. I have long wanted to design something for a mobile, and the chance was excellent. Having thrown everything away and plunged headlong into the task, in just five days he formed a concept and designed key screens, which he </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wrote</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> about in detail </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on Habr√©. And even later, as a team, they prototyped and decorated everything in a full-fledged case.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
While working on the mobile application interface for Alfa-Bank Ukraine, I suddenly realized that I had not experienced such powerful enthusiasm and flow conditions for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I realized that my daily tasks turned into a routine and no longer bring past pleasure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, designing a mobile application interface gave me a lot of new challenges and completely captured me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I began to actively visualize a large mobile application project. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And in between visualizations, he was entertained by usability audits of random projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By writing, ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can All Money Be? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Three million site </font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">usability audit</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äùand then‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How Maksidoma marketers lose millions by flirting with Growth marketing: independent usability audit</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">", I could not imagine what a big role they will play in my visualization.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A crisis</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Working with regular customers, I unknowingly fell into the comfort zone and practically stopped doing anything to attract new ones. When part of the old customers began to fall away for various reasons, and all the old activities ceased to bring leads, a crisis broke out in the company that made me write again. By this time, we already had a significant number of cases worthy of attention. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On behalf of the company, we told several stories, but the most successful and failed was ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The story of one landing: attracted many customers and was copied a hundred times</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">". The article hung all day on the main page of vc.ru, receiving significant coverage by the standards of the site (now more than 40 thousand views), as well as on Habr√© (48 thousand views) and attracted a total of more than 100 leads. The problem was that most of them wanted a landing (which I was already not interested in doing) with the same deep and high-quality approach, but for 500 rubles, of course. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Nevertheless, the articles worked, and we found customers who allowed us to get out of the crisis.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fornex has become one of the new customers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As it turned out, this is a fairly successful hosting with a large pool of customers and an excellent level of service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, visiting the company‚Äôs website a year earlier, visitors without a recommendation could only guess about it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those rare lucky ones, who nevertheless wished to become a client, faced a lot of difficulties that form a clearly negative impression of the company as a whole. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After reviewing the flow order, without drastic changes, we were able to significantly improve the conversion already in the first iteration. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And over time, having completely redesigned key landing pages, increase the number of new customers at times.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Company closure</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The way out of the crisis only had a short-term effect on my inner worldview. I still tried to give myself completely to work and betrayed a high level of quality. At the same time, he spent much more energy and time than in the old days. There is more frustration and cheaper dopamine. The nearby patisserie has become a favorite place for dinner, and previously thrown off kilograms began to return. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, the real impetus for the decision to close the company was an order to design a Wellness-marketplace mobile application for the US market (remember about my visualization?). It was the same megaproject, full of new challenges that I had been waiting for. With unprecedented enthusiasm for a long time, I literally pounced on working on it, giving the rest of the work to the team.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I began to come to the office before everyone else. Every day I experienced an intoxicating feeling of flow. I was gushing with energy and for the first time in a long time I again enjoyed working. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And finally he admitted to himself that the company has long been a burden. I realized that the desire to embrace everything at once was a mistake that led to my burnout. I realized that I wanted to focus on what was actually always interesting to me - User Experience Design. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãclosing the company was in the air for a long time, so it was not a big surprise for the employees when, one morning, when I parked my car near the office, I suddenly felt that the time had come.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Having dismissed the staff and successfully completed work on the design of the marketplace application, I needed to get distracted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, after a few weeks, my family and I went for the winter to the island of Tenerife. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resting for several months under the warm sun, I suddenly realized that I had never gone away from work before in my life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That earlier, even on vacation, did not stop thinking about work and related problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I realized how much I became truly free for the first time in many years, and how the once-lost energy fills me again.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conclusion</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For five years, we launched a hundred projects: from static one-handed students to large, technically complex sites. We worked with a variety of businesses: from startups to large companies. We stepped on the slippery path of binary options. Corrected interface errors of a dating application with a millionth audience. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, they never resorted to paid advertising and most of the time did not even have their own website. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Nevertheless, clients found us and were ready to wait in moments when we could not take the project to work immediately. We have built long-term relationships with many of them and parted as friends.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We were not chosen for ratings, design trends or dumping. Business orientation and understanding of the deep-seated goals of creating this or that product strongly discord with what customers heard before they accidentally found us. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the time of closure, we had enough clients and funds for operations. My managerial mistakes and the wrong priorities that finally killed off energy were the only good reason. </font></font><br>
