<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why did you decide to go</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Forex Club is usually remembered in the context of online trading at exchange rates. But this company works with several types of currency instruments in different countries of the world. Because of this, she has a very complex IT infrastructure with her own platform for customers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the time of our acquaintance, the back-office of the company used several different platforms and applications. The main working tool for most of the employees was the Microsoft office suite and mail on Zimbra. Above all this, an add-on from additional storages, backups, antivirus, numerous connectors and integrations, as well as Microsoft and Zimbra license management with periodic audits.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Forex Club IT department was unprofitable to support this system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sophisticated infrastructure required the rental of a large number of servers, DRP plans in case of disconnection of these servers or a failure of the Internet connection, backups. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To ensure trouble-free operation, a special department of administrators was formed over time, which still had the task of license audits. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Due to the abundance of different programs, ordinary Forex Club employees also had problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without means of tracking versions of documents, it was difficult to find the author of some corrections and the final version of the text or table.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In an effort to reduce maintenance costs, Forex Club was looking for a way to solve the same problems easier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is where our interaction began.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Search for an alternative</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To implement full-fledged collaboration, it was necessary to change the approach itself - to move from local storage to the cloud. Forex Club began looking for a common cloud solution for all office applications. There were two candidates: Office 365 and G Suite.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Office 365 was a priority since many Forex Club licenses were purchased from Microsoft. But Office 365 only migrates some of the features of the office suite to the cloud. Users still need to download the application from their personal account and use it to work with documents according to the old scheme: send and re-save copies with version indexes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Google Cloud G Suite has more collaboration features, and it's cheaper. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case of Microsoft products, I would have to use the Enterprise Agreement, and this is a completely different level of expenses (even taking into account the purchased software). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the implementation of G Suite with our help went through the Google program, which compensated large customers for the cost of switching to the company's services. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was planned to transfer to G Suite most of the services that employees use:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Calendar and email (Gmail and Google Calendar);</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Notes (Google Keep);</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chat and online conferences (Chat, Hangouts);</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Office suite and survey generator (Google Docs, Google Forms);</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shared Storage (GDrive).</font></font><br>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Overcome the negative</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/08/st/a2/08sta2m28fokqte8coq90gtlkl0.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The implementation of any tool, even the most convenient one, always faces the negative of end users. The main reason is conservatism, since people do not want to change anything and get used to new approaches in work. The situation was complicated by the specific perception of the presence on the web as just going to sites (but not working on these sites), common among non-IT employees. They simply did not understand how to work with this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the Forex CLub side, Dmitry Ostroverkhov was responsible for the implementation of the project. He controlled the stages of implementation, collected user reviews and prioritized tasks. Joint training, employee surveys, explanations of the rules of the company made it easier for us to start.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main objective of Softline in this project was to train users and system administrators and technical support in the first stage. We explained how the product should work through a series of trainings. In total, we conducted 15 trainings of 4 hours each. The first - before the pilot - for system administrators who set the stage for transformation. And the subsequent ones are already for ordinary employees.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As part of the main training program, we emphasized the advantages that compensated the end users for the difficulty of getting used to the new tool. And at the end of each training, employees could come up with their questions, which removed the pitfalls at the beginning of the work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although Forex Club holds training seminars for its own clients, the company could not start training on G Suite on its own due to the lack of teachers with the necessary competencies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To evaluate the impact of our trainings, Forex Club conducted surveys of students before the training and some time after it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first survey showed mostly negative perceptions of future changes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second - on the contrary, the rise of positive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People began to realize that this applied to their work.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pilot office</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The project began at the end of 2017, when ten system administrators switched to G Suite. These people had to become pioneers who identified the pros and cons of the solution and paved the way for transformation. We took into account their feedback and recommendations, and in January 2018 we selected a medium-sized branch with a local system administrator for the first test transition of non-IT employees.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The transition was made simultaneously. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, it‚Äôs hard for people to switch to new tools, so if you can choose between a cloud solution and a desktop application, users will tend to a more familiar desktop and slow down global update plans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, upon completion of the training for the pilot office, we quickly transferred everyone to the G Suite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first couple of weeks, there was still some resistance; a local system administrator dealt with it, who explained and showed all the difficult moments. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Following the pilot office, we completely transferred the entire Forex Club IT department to the G Suite.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We change a branch network</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After analyzing the experience of the pilot project, we, together with the Forex Club IT department, developed a transition plan for the rest of the company. It was originally planned that the process will take place in two stages. At the first stage, we wanted to train only the most Forex Club employees who are most loyal to the product, who will promote the project in their offices - they will help colleagues move to a new platform in the second stage. To select the ‚Äúevangelists‚Äù in the company, we conducted a survey, the results of which exceeded all expectations: about half of the entire Forex Club responded. Then we decided not to stretch the process and missed the stage of ‚Äúimplementation through employees‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As in the pilot project, first the head offices migrated, where there is a local system administrator - he helped to cope with the arising difficulties. In each office, the transition to new tools was preceded by training. Training had to be planned according to a flexible schedule, which took into account different time zones and work schedules. For example, for offices in Kazakhstan and China, the trainings had to start at 5 am Moscow time (by the way, G Suite works fine in China, no matter what). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Following the head offices, a branch network has switched to G Suite - about 100 points. The peculiarity of the last stage of the project was that in these branches there are mainly salespeople who work a lot with spreadsheets. For them, we conducted training for two weeks to help transfer data.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, our specialists worked behind the scenes of support for Forex Club itself, since immediately after the transition to G Suite, the number of calls to technical support increased as expected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The peak of applications fell on the transition of the branch network, but gradually the number of requests began to decrease. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Applications for office products and e-mail, management of software licenses, work with servers and network equipment, as well as backup communication channels were especially reduced. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, the implementation has reduced the load on the first line of support and back-office. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In total, the transfer of offices took about two months: in February 2018, work was completed in the head offices, and in March - throughout the branch network.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Underwater rocks</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/uz/j3/zsuzj3iyrls-7atw0uwlmag8rjc.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A major problem was the speed of email migration. It took 1 second to transfer one email from Zimbra to Gmail using IMAP Sync. About 700 employees work in hundreds of Forex Club offices, and each of them has thousands of letters (in total, they serve more than 2 million customers). So to speed up the migration, we used the G Suite Migration Tool, with it the process of copying letters went faster.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Data from calendars and tasks was not required to be transferred. Although there were some solutions in the old infrastructure, they were not fully used by employees. For example, corporate calendars were implemented in the form of a portal on Bitrix, which is inconvenient, therefore, employees had their own tools, and the employees engaged in data transfer independently.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, users were transferred to transfer operational documents (we are only talking about data on current work - a different solution is used for the company's knowledge base). No questions have arisen here. It was just that at some point an administrative line was drawn - the responsibility for the information stored locally passed to the users themselves, while the IT department already monitored the safety and security of data on Google Drive.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unfortunately, not all workflows managed to pick up analogues in G Suite. For example, the general mailboxes that Forex Club employees are used to using in Gmail do not have filters, so finding a specific letter is difficult. The same difficulty was with SSO authorization in Google Chat, but this problem was solved through a request in support of Google.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main problems for users were related to the fact that Google services do not yet have part of the competitors' functions, for example, the same Skype or Office 365. Hangouts only allows you to make calls, Google Chat lacks quoting, and Google Sheets supports Microsoft Excel macros. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, Microsoft and Google Cloud products have different approaches to table editing tools. Word files that contain spreadsheets sometimes open with incorrect formatting in Google Docs.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As we get used to the new infrastructure, some of the difficulties were solved through alternative approaches. For example, instead of macros, spreadsheets use scripts that seem even more convenient for Forex Club employees. Failed to find an analogue only for the financial department of Forex Club, which deals with 1C reports (with scripts, complex formatting). Therefore, he switched to Google Sheet only in terms of collaboration. For other documents, the office suite (Excel) is still used.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In total, Forex Club left about 10% of Microsoft Office licenses. For such projects, this is normal practice: fewer employees use the advanced features of office suites, so the rest can easily accept a replacement.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It should be noted that no large-scale transformations were carried out on the rest of the infrastructure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forex Club did not abandon Jira and Confluence, although it introduced Google Keep for operational tasks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To integrate Jira and Confluence with the G Suite, we have deployed plugins that allow you to quickly transfer data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The monitoring system has been preserved, as well as many additional tools: Trello, Teamup, CRM, Metrics, AWS, etc. Naturally, the system administrators remained in the branches.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chromebook experiment</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In search of a way to cut costs, Forex Club intended to transfer everyone to Chromebook-based mobile workstations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The device itself is extremely cheap, and using cloud services on it, you can quickly deploy a workstation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We tested mobile jobs on a small group of 25 users in the sales department. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The employees of this department did not have tasks that would prevent work only through the web, so for them this migration should have passed unnoticed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But according to the test results, it turned out that the hardware of an inexpensive Chromebook does not work correctly for all Forex Club enterprise applications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And more expensive models that fit the technical parameters turned out to be commensurate in value with classic laptops based on Windows. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, they decided to abandon the project.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What has changed with the advent of G Suite</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite all the prejudices and distrust, already 3 months after the training in the polls, 80% of the staff said that G Suite really made it easier for them to work with documents. After the transition, the mobility of employees who began to work more with wearable devices increased: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qu/bx/wb/qubxwbsuqj4n8-w8bte9prabap8.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Statistics on the use of mobile devices according to Forex Club</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Google Forms gained great popularity. Inside departments, they allow you to quickly conduct surveys for which you previously had to use mail, collecting the results manually. The most questions and complaints were caused by the transition to Google Chat and Hangouts Meet, as they generally have fewer functions, but their use allowed to abandon many messengers within the company.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The project results were formulated by Dmitry Ostroverkhov, with whom we worked: ‚ÄúThe project reduced the costs of the Forex Club on IT infrastructure and simplified its support. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A whole layer of process maintenance tasks has disappeared, as these issues are being addressed by Google. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now all services can be configured remotely, they are supported by a couple of Google administrators, and the IT department has freed up time and resources for other things. ‚Äù</font></font></div>
