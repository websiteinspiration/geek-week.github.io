Hello! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will mean that if you read this, you </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">have passed the</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Hollow Knight. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This will allow me not to describe every stump, but to devote more time to important things.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">my </font></font></a> <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">essays</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> about the City of Tears, I touched on the topic of how the player’s behavior is formed. But if there the focus was on the situation itself, and I did not go into too much detail so as not to overload the story; now I want to deal with this in as much detail as necessary. So I'm starting a series of Hollow Knight game design material. And here is the time to clarify, since the concept of game design is too broad. In a general sense, it is about how to convey to a person a conceived experience. </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Me</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">interested in how gameplay capabilities lead to certain behaviors, so this will be the central focus. It’s clear that sound production, the visual component, and other undoubtedly important things will also influence how you behave, so sometimes I will talk about them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order to analyze how well the game is able to convey experience, you need to understand how it was conceived. To do this, consider the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">page in Steam</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . We highlight the main thing: Hollow Knight - an </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">adventure</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that offers to learn about the secrets of the ancient kingdom, while you have to </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fight</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">explore a</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> lot </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Also an important characteristic is the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">variability</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Here it must be added that for a midcore audience this game will be at least human. Moreover, only the word “classic” hints at complexity in the description, which is very strange. So always pay attention to the tags. Naturally, in addition to the incentive, a person could learn about the game thanks to Kickstarter, reviews, simply by receiving advice or from any other source of information. And all this is not directly connected with the work, so it is important to understand how much the first hours of the game will affect the final experience.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you think about what affects the player’s behavior, then many things will come to mind. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But what to focus on at the very beginning? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You have probably heard repeatedly about the power of color, light, guide lines, composition, as well as other classical techniques that allow you to control human attention. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And these are fairly universal rules, but they are </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">not a guarantee</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that, even in a linear game, a person will do what is intended. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did Team Cherry cope with the initial stage of the passage, where the most important aspects of game behavior are laid down? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's get it right.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</font></font><source src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/8bf3b6cb-4496-84c0-629a-2e0542267960/-/format/mp4/" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The video does not say anything, except that some unknown crap happened. This is important, since if specific information was communicated in it, it would greatly influence further behavior, since the player would not know anything more about the world. GG falls, the player gains control, and the question immediately arises, where to go, left or right? Well, first of all, the HC is initially turned to the right, if there is previous experience, then he will also tell you that the basic direction in platformers is from left to right. One can speculate on why this is so: maybe because Europeans read from left to right, from top to bottom. But one of the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">first cult platformers was</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> made by the Japanese ... and then it's time to chop off this whole story, because the </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">probability of a certain behavior is important if it leads to significant changes</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. (And in this case, there is a dead end with geo on the left). That is why, in most cases, I will first consider the options available to the player, and only then supplement them with reasoning, if at all. For this reason, we’ll take a look at the entire tutorial at once. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/3c/se/ss3cse-fdferyydodbetm3lwsrm.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, there are segments that, when passing, will guarantee that the player has mastered the mechanics, since without doing this, they cannot be passed. Further, a treatment guide and a platform section, where the wings are interfering with this. Then again platforming, and the finish line. Moreover, already in the tutorial there are optional branches with nishtyaks. It works this way: the player commits a certain behavior, at the end of which he receives a </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">reward</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, and now he will try to reproduce the actions that led to her, again. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conversely, undesirable behavior for developers is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">punished</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and after that the player will try to avoid this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is how </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">operant learning is used</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , without the application of the principles of which no modern video game can do.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</font></font><source src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/7d5c7ecf-d96b-7a78-7856-898c9484c568/-/format/mp4/" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This segment is interesting in that the obstacle is insurmountable without knowledge of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">poging</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , so if the reception succeeds, then the amulet will be a more substantial reward than a simple bunch of geo. Thus, the player is encouraged to deal with mechanics more thoroughly. So the study in this game is not only about passing locations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Later, on the way, a blood-spot is met, but it happens as if by the way, without really explaining the usefulness of this mechanics. The fact is that these cocoons are located mainly in hidden places next to an increasingly complicated piece of location, thus encouraging players who explore every corner. And her appearance in the tutorial out of the blue only confuses, and does not teach anything except the message that such mechanics exist at all.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then a small piece of information remains, and after that - Gryazmut. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It has the first NPC. He will give some information that everyone else will do after him. The interest of their monologues will depend on the personality of the player. And in any case, the characters will simply spur the feeling of the unknown, thereby motivating them to move on. Here you get acquainted with the local conservation system, which, by the way, can be abused, and it’s pretty easy to find out about it, but it will be nice to many. At the end you can find a dead end with a locked door. Further descent to the Forgotten Crossroads. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/bz/d3/m6bzd3cgjoqabd2hdqf53kpozw8.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here the player has the only path along which he will pass in 100% of cases, everything else is optional. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">video version</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I analyze the content of each room, as this affects paging, and therefore allows the viewer to feel it. Here I will analyze the most important points. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-z/1n/tx/-z1ntxtkzzy46jzbakacl57ox1i.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Temple of the Black Egg</font></font><br>
</i><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This room has a point of interest, and it is important to understand why the player is very likely to visit her. This is how </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">research behavior</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> works </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: when an animal is in an unfamiliar environment, it will study the environment around it. This has been fixed in evolution since it increases the chances of survival, so it works with everyone, regardless of individuality. And yes: there are nuances, as in almost all such things, which I will talk about, but I will only mention them in cases where it is necessary.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jf/ww/wo/jfwwwoquee8a2x9dk7kpuq3d7be.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the end of the floor, the first serious enemy is the time to talk about how death affects the player. There are two factors. Firstly, this is a </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">penalty</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for defeat, so that the player will continue to try to avoid him. And secondly, this is a </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">negative reinforcement</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , which should make people return to the place of death. Together, this creates a price for the player’s skills: in such a situation, achieving the goal will be much more pleasant.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Behind the cudgel is a caterpillar, which, like geo, is a promise of reward. And in some cases, the expectation of a promotion is much nicer than the promotion itself, and allows you to more effectively control the behavior of the player. It is also important that geo can be lost, but the caterpillars provide a guarantee of profit, but, their location is more valuable. And even if the player does not yet know about it, then the caterpillar itself is currently new information, thus encouraging research. Well, besides, think about the player’s emotions when he sees a sad caterpillar. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m_/9h/r9/m_9hr9m4xiwp9vnfoeu6ihdgmx8.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mine</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important to note here: if a person played at least one metrodiving, then he understands how the structure of such games is structured, and, well, it will be better to feel the level design. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when such a player sees an insurmountable obstacle at first glance, the very first thought that comes to his head will be: "Well, I see, I need an upgrade." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, there will be such people who conduct the experiment, and only then, making sure that at this stage the passage is really inaccessible, will go on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to the destructible floor, there will also be npc, a totem, and the location itself looks new, so the entry into the branch is once again awarded. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it will be so almost always that it is logical in a game where a big focus is on research - the player immediately gets into the habit of going into every nook and cranny.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</font></font><source src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/d1540a66-7e2e-6788-fedc-c6d56632977e/-/format/mp4/" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another segment that rewards for curiosity and dexterity. You can’t jump to the caterpillar in the usual way, but you can use the pogo on the winged wing. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pr/cj/xl/prcjxl72c_ba0vv8gsxgexdpljo.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This room will introduce the Father of Caterpillars, and also if a player comes here after meeting at least one of them, he will receive a reward. Since this is an important game mechanic, it is worth noting that the room is likely to be visited, because: it is located at the very beginning of the first location, the entrance is highlighted with an arch, light and an understandable ledge. So that was done enough so that the player does not miss this element. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ox/v1/qk/oxv1qksodpcgcvmsuipgry1eo1m.png"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next passage is also highlighted, and a new enemy is encountered in it, which cannot be defeated at the moment.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o5/si/nw/o5sinwhilhoi2af1bzfnhondxym.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the ledge below is not so clearly distinguished, which is not surprising, since the passage at this stage for a large number of players will end with the need for an upgrade. However, it can be overcome with the help of poging, and in this case, meet a mini-boss, who is the strongest enemy at this stage. There are not many opportunities to dodge, but in total you will have to strike 60 hits. Challenge, though not easy, but quite surmountable, since there are a sufficient number of windows for both healing and attacks. As a reward, the player will receive a piece of the mask, which by itself does nothing, and the geo from Cherevnya does not drop out at all. Thus, the main reward will be the recognition that a person has passed an optional test, which most players will miss at the beginning. For some it will be very cool, but I would still throw a geo from above.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After the shortcut, which leads to the mandatory branch. Here you get acquainted with the map. It is provided by Cornifer, the new npc, whose presence in the future will become an extremely pleasant event for the player. An interesting fact: the cartographer did not signal his presence with humming and sheets of paper in the release version, but this changed after less than two weeks. In addition to buying a card, the player learns that in the store in Gryazmut you can buy useful gizmos that will help you navigate even better. What’s important to note here: if until now the developers didn’t have much money to predict the likelihood of visiting rooms and in general the path that the player will choose, now the central place in the formation of behavior associated with moving around a location and between them will be occupied by a map . Of course, there will be peoplewho want to play blindly or will use the card very rarely, but I will not consider this category in this analysis, since the game involves the use of this mechanics.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/jt/vg/xqjtvgoizadckp-xrl85zs0y6mc.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here is the first destructible wall in the game, and it would seem that this is an excellent acquaintance with the new mechanics, but the player can easily miss it, because the threshold is not large enough: if you do not adjust the recoil from the blow, the character will fall, and later the player can start beat the stone on the other side. Also in this room an encounter first encounters, in which there will also be new enemies. On the right are hot springs and a shop.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hb/r1/4e/hbr14e1mwgggki0zqxfibaqurn4.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And here most of the players are most likely to meet their first mini-boss. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Uterine Zhuzhzh is not a particularly dangerous opponent, but in case of death she will have to go decently if she does not find a shop near the station, and even more so near hot springs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a reward, the player will receive a geo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the right is an inaccessible slope, from where disturbing maniacal sounds are heard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then you can find Sly, after the dialogue he will sell useful things in Gryazmut. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/qm/vn/ohqmvnnj5m-yqm9hph8gxiqpqx8.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The station is located in a logical place: of course, sooner or later the player will be able to explore previously inaccessible passages, and he will quickly reach the required place, having come to the Crossroads either from here or from Gryazmut.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</font></font><source src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/bc11bfc1-f784-2a36-a645-98279764ec91/-/format/mp4/" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The False Knight is clearly more complicated than the Uterus Buzz, but still should not cause difficulties. The attacks are slow, demolish the standard single mask both during attacks and when approaching. The windows for the heal are huge. There are no problems with hitboxes and cabling. If HC dies, then just a couple of rooms and you can try again. By the way, I will speak about the last three things only if there are some shoals. The boss’s only difficulty is that he can only accumulate his soul during attacks of the maggot himself, but not his armor.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An interesting detail: as soon as the boss performs his attack for the first time after the night, the left side of the arena will become flimsy and can be broken. According to the developers, this was done for those people who even the first boss will be too difficult to overcome. And this option is the opportunity to continue the journey, and with renewed vigor to return and try again later. It sounds interesting because it adds variety, but there are a number of problems. For example: I did not know about this opportunity exactly until I read about it on the wiki. And I also read the comments of other people who also had no idea about it, so the problem is not an isolated one. Why is that? Firstly, the possibility itself is not obvious. Before this battle, we could meet only 2 of such encounters, and it was impossible to get out of them alive without defeating the enemy.Destructible walls themselves could be met in the same way, but there is no guarantee that a particular player will know about them, even taking into account all the efforts made. One way or another, the destructible wall of the arena is the first such case (and, by the way, the only one). Well, okay, let's say you could guess, because the cracks in the wall are clearly visible, as well as visually this is emphasized by flying boards. Okay, but what if the player is at the other end of the arena? It should also be borne in mind that at this moment his attention will be focused on the battle. If it is too easy to fight, you may notice this detail, but it will not be useful to you. And if it’s difficult, then most likely miss it, if for the sake of fun in a panic you don’t start hammering on the walls, they say “let me out”: in this case, you will have a pleasant surprise. For some reason the boss attacks,if he pushes the player against the wall, they cannot destroy the exit. It is also strange that no cracking, crunching or the like occurs with the visual effect.</font></font><br>

Well, okay, let's say the player for whom this opportunity was intended took advantage of it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And ... he will only have to run. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But imagine how cool it would be for him to conceive this boss, causing him damage through the floor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A man was in a hopeless situation a few seconds ago, and now he will have a feeling that he “outwitted the game” because he was attentive and also understands how it works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was a great opportunity for developers to reward the player for research, which, unfortunately, they did not use. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead, the knight flies off to an unattainable place, and does not remain on the edge, and only then does the maggot come out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And without causing damage to it, it is impossible to win the battle, alas.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And yes, this is by no means a serious jamb. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I talk about this because I find this situation interesting from a design point of view - there is a lot to learn. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a reward, the player will receive a geo, as well as the emblem of the city, which cannot be applied yet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the very mention of the city is clearly interesting.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</font></font><source src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/e8148546-1852-7bf8-8055-058ffecfe682/-/format/mp4/" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the tribal mound is an upgrade that will allow you to head to the next location. The room itself, of course, is redesigned in such a way that without the use of a spell it does not pass. So now the player will know how to deal with Ancient Baldr at the entrance to the Green Trail. Immediately after is the amulet. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And now, depending on the previous actions, the player can investigate the location, or go to the next. In any case, let's see what the player offers Sly with Iselda.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The whole assortment cannot be bought, so you have to choose. If you completely run through the Crossroads, while not losing anything at death, and also not farming hard, then in the end there will be about 1200 geo. Of which the player is very likely to spend 30 on the map, 220 on the compass, 120 on the pen, and also 50 on the station. It remains 780. It is important that farming in this location is not very pleasant. The most effective way is to kill the shell of the guard, from which 45 geo spills out. So let's say that since a maximum of 5 a player can go to him, but then she’ll get bored anyway.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Naturally, there may be people who have nothing to do with it, and they immediately farm 1800 geo lanterns on their lantern, which will allow them to visit the Crystal Canyon as a second location, although they will not be able to really explore it, since there will be no necessary upgrades. And everything will end in the Land of Peace, where is the nail of dreams. Route is possible, but of little interest and unlikely, so we will not dwell on it in detail. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to the flashlight, you can purchase fragments of the mask, and if a person explores the location completely, then he will go to the green trail, receiving an additional hit point, which is not very likely for most of the players, since this will require collecting 5 tracks, for two of which you need to use pogo, what the game does not teach in the first location, as well as defeating the Witcher, which is more difficult than the main boss.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</font></font><source src="https://leonardo.osnova.io/63e9e0cc-0a0e-7437-b1a1-c07cd4f456a5/-/format/mp4/" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Someone will be interested in the key, provided knowledge of the door behind the cemetery. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The result for such a price may disappoint, but with the help of the key, the player either gets the opportunity to return his shadow for rotten eggs, or retains it until better times, but remember that since the budget is limited, the key is unlikely to be bought if the door is not was found. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The player most likely has repeatedly faced the fact that geo sometimes fall on thorns, thus becoming inaccessible, so the benefit of the Raking Swarm will be clear to him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, at this stage you have to choose, because only 3 cells are available. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But with the Strong Shell it will not be so obvious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if you buy it and experiment a little, it will not be clear how useful this amulet is.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then there are only pins that Iselda sells. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since I suspect that most players will want to navigate the map better, some of the pins are almost a must. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we assume that the player is very likely to buy several of them.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Total</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first location is held without any difficulties by the average player. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By middle here I mean anyone who has completed at least a few action games. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, despite the fact that the game is gradually becoming more complicated, it teaches new mechanics, reveals the details of the world - the pace is quite low. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It’s too early to draw conclusions regarding these variables; I will leave them for the final essay on the game’s game design. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Next time I’ll tell you about the Green Path and Mushroom Wastelands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not forget to write your thoughts about this material in the comments - this will help me improve the quality of content in the future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks for watching, bye.</font></font></div>
