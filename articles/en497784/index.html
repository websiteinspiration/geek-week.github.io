Today - about what concepts and technologies Huawei proposes to build data centers on the basis of.</font></font><br>

In the era of the “connected world”, data storage and processing tasks require new approaches at all stages of the data center life cycle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They must simultaneously become both simpler and “smarter” in order to cope with the role assigned to them as the central elements of the infrastructure of the global digital economy. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2018, humanity stored 33 zettabytes of information, but by 2025 its total volume should grow by more than five times. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Three decades of experience in the development of ICT infrastructures allowed Huawei to prepare well for the growing “data tsunami” and offer its partners and customers the concept of an intelligent data center, including all stages of its construction, operation and maintenance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Elements of this concept are combined under the general name HiDC.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Digitalize it</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A fresh joke walks around the web: who has accelerated the digital transformation of your company the most - CEO, CTO, board of directors? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The coronavirus epidemic! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only the lazy does not hold webinars, does not write articles, does not tell how and what to do. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But all these are reactive actions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some prepared in advance.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not for the sake of bragging - for objective reasons, let’s cite as an example our company, in which the digital transformation was launched on a large scale several years ago. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Currently, we are able to transfer almost all employees to work from home without any loss of efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The story with a hospital built in Wuhan in ten days is indicative. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There, the digital transformation proved itself in the fact that all IT systems were deployed in three days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So digital transformation is not about “when” and “why,” but about “how.”</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Architectural approach instead of spontaneous development</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What are the main problems that confront us when we begin to build a certain system? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Until now, all our customers are working in a mode of combining business tasks with application services and IT solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is quite difficult to get a general idea of ​​the functioning of such a complex if it was created simply by adding various blocks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in order to build a system as a single organism, first of all, an architectural approach is needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We embodied it in the ideology of our HiDC solution.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d3/ir/ju/d3irjulhuxi8mpslduebbbvlbya.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maximum value and minimum value</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The entire HiDC structure is two main slices. The first is what you are used to seeing with Huawei, a classic infrastructure. The elements of the second slice are most easily combined by the term “smart data”. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why is this needed? Nowadays, many companies accumulate enormous amounts of information, often scattered or accessible through various kinds of "laying". Yes, take at least regular databases. Ask your database administrators how these databases are interconnected and how to use the information from them in BI systems for making business decisions. Surprisingly, DBs are often very weakly connected with each other and function as separate “islands”. Therefore, first of all, we thought about what architectural approaches this problem could be eliminated.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">HiDC Architecture Design Principles</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Consider the basic design principles of HiDC. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, it will be useful not to specialists of any particular direction, but to architects of solutions that can cover the whole panorama with a look. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The most common are converged network units and data management units. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And already here a concept arises that solution architects rarely think about - data lifecycle management. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From classical databases, he migrated to many other systems, including cloud and boundary (edge) computing.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote>    .      —   ,      .  ,    «»  —  ,     .             (  — ).</blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It’s great when we have at our disposal all six blocks of the HiDC structure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, often customers work in a previously created environment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, using even one block from the circuit above can bear fruit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if you add a second, third and so on, a synergistic effect will begin to appear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The combination of a network and a distributed storage system alone will give higher performance and lower latency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The block approach allows us to develop not randomly, as often happens in the industry, but using an integrated architectural approach. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, the openness of the blocks themselves provides freedom in choosing the optimal solution.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Converged Network Times</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Recently, in the world and Russian markets, we are increasingly zealously promoting the concept of converged networks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Already today, our customers are using converged solutions on RoCEv2 (RDMA over Converged Ethernet v2) to build distributed software-defined storage systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main advantage of this approach is its openness and the absence of the need to create an indefinite number of disparate networks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why haven’t you done this before? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recall that the Ethernet standard was developed in 1969. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For half a century, it has accumulated a lot of problems, but Huawei learned to solve them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, thanks to a number of additional steps, we can use Ethernet for mission-critical applications, highly loaded solutions, etc.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From DCN to DCI</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next important trend is the synergistic effect of the introduction of DCI (Data Center Interconnect). In Russia, unlike China, something similar so far can only be found among telecom operators. When customers consider network solutions for the data center, they usually do not pay due attention to the deep integration of optical networks and classic IP solutions within a single point of presence. They use familiar solutions that work on the IP layer, which is enough for them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why then do you need DCI? Imagine that the DWDM host administrator and network administrator act independently. At some point, the failure that occurred to any of them can seriously reduce your fault tolerance. And if we use the principle of synergy, IP routing is carried out taking into account what is happening on the optical network. The use of such an intelligent service significantly increases the number of nines in the level of availability of the entire system.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another major advantage of our DCI is its large performance margin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Summing up the possibilities of the ranges C and L, you can get about 220 lambdas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such a reserve is unlikely to be quickly exhausted even by a large corporate customer, given that our current solution allows transferring up to 400 Gbit / s through each lambda. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the future, on the same equipment it will be possible to achieve 800 Gb / s. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Additional convenience is provided by the general controllability that we provide through classically open interfaces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">NETCONF manages not only the switches, but also the optical compaction devices, which allows convergence to be achieved at all levels and to perceive the system as an intellectual resource rather than a “set of boxes”.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Edge computing is more important</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many have heard about Edge Computing. And those involved in cloud and classic data centers, it should be borne in mind that we have recently seen a serious shift in the direction of boundary computing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What caused this? Let's look at general implementation models. Now they talk a lot about “smart cities”, “smart homes”, etc. This concept allows the developer to create added value and increase the price of the property. "Smart Home" identifies its resident, lets in and out, provides him with some services. According to statistics, such services add about 10-15% to the price of apartments and in general are able to push the development of new business models. Also, earlier it was said about the concepts of autopilots. Soon, the development of 5G and Wi-Fi 6 technologies will ensure an extremely low latency in the transfer of data between smart homes, cars, and the main data center that produce border computing. This means that it will be possible to perform a much larger number of operations related to serious data processing. To solve such problems,in particular, you can use neural processors that are already shipped to Russia.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The prospects for the trend just outlined are undeniable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Imagine, for example, an intelligent urban transport management system that can switch traffic lights, regulate traffic loads on specific streets, or even take adequate measures during emergency situations. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now let's turn to the resources with which we provide the implementation of the HiDC concept.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Calculations</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When we need to implement a standard computing system, processors with x86 architecture are, of course, using it. But as soon as the need arises for customization, it’s time to think about more diverse solutions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, for example, ARM processors, due to the large number of cores, are excellent for applications with a high degree of parallelism. Multithreading gives a gain in productivity of about 30%. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If low latency is critical to us, FPGAs come to the fore.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Neural processors are primarily needed when solving machine learning problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If for a specific implementation we need 16 racks with 8 servers each packed with neuroprocessors, then a solution of the same level based on the x86 architecture would require (!) About 128 racks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you can see, a wide variety of types of calculations makes you carefully choose hardware platforms.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Data storage</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For the second year, Huawei has been calling partners, customers, industry colleagues to build storage systems in accordance with the principle of Flash Only. And most of our customers use mechanical spindle drives only in old solutions or for rarely used archive data. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Flash systems are evolving too. Storage Class Memory (SCM) systems such as Intel Optane are coming onto the market. Interesting developments are demonstrated by Chinese and Japanese manufacturers. Currently, SCM is superior in processing class to all other solutions. So far, only the high cost does not allow them to be used everywhere.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, we see that the quality of storage must be improved not only on the conditional backend, but also on the front-end. Now, de facto, in new implementations, we usually offer and use mechanisms for direct access to memory via Ethernet, but we see a request from customers and therefore closer to the end of the year we will begin to use NVMe over Fabrics more often. Moreover, end-to-end, to provide a common architecture, which, of course, must be high-performance and resistant to the failure of controllers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
OceanStor Dorado Storage is one of our flagship products. Internal tests have shown that it provides performance at the level of 20 million IOPS, while maintaining operability in case of failure of seven of the eight controllers.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why so much power? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's look at the current situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For several months now, Chinese people have spent much more time at home in connection with the isolation regime. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Internet traffic at this time increased by an average of 30%, and in some provinces, even doubled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The consumption of a variety of network services has increased. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And at some point, the same banks began to experience a serious additional load, for which their storage systems were not ready. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is clear that not everyone needs 20 million IOPS now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But what will happen tomorrow? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our intelligent systems maximize the potential of neural processors in order to ensure traffic compactness, deduplication, optimization and rapid data recovery.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Core network</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
2020, as we mentioned in the previous article, will be the year of core networks for us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many customers, especially application service providers (ASPs) and banks, are already thinking about how their applications will work precisely in terms of communication with data centers and between data centers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here a new core network comes to the rescue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As an example, let’s take the largest Chinese banks that switched to simplified support systems that use not a dozen different protocols for communication between data centers, but, relatively speaking, a couple - OSPF and SRv6. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Despite the fact that the organization receives the same set of services.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intellectual resources</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How to use the data? Until recently, there was a fragmented system of disparate databases: Microsoft SQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc. To work with them, solutions from the big data field were used that could combine this data, collect it, and work with them. All this created a high load on resources. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, there was no mechanism for performing operations with data upon the occurrence of an event. The solution was to develop data lifecycle management (DLM) principles.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone has heard about data lakes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the transition from data management to data governance, “digital lakes” began to rapidly “grow wiser”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Including thanks to Huawei solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the following materials, we will tell you about the whole stack of software technologies that we used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now it’s important to note that it was the use of “smart” data lifecycle management that allowed us to simplify the use of our network and servers, as well as learn how to build end-to-end architectures to better understand the principles of working with data.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Data Center Engineering Infrastructure</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We will publish separate materials on engineering infrastructure, however, in the context of today's topic, we would like to mention those changes that are related to the HiDC concept. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For a long time, the use of lithium batteries in emergency and backup power supply systems (PSA) of the data center was banned due to their high fire hazard. Any mechanical damage or violation of the integrity of the battery could lead to fire and unpredictable consequences. In this regard, PSAs were equipped with obsolete acid batteries having a low specific charge density with a large mass.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Huawei’s new emergency and backup power systems utilize intelligent lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries with intelligent proactive control. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same capacity, they take up three times less volume than acid batteries. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Their life cycle is 10–15 years, which, among other things, reduces the environmental burden they create. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The patented control system in the SmartLi ecosystem allows the use of hybrid systems consisting of arrays of old and new type of batteries, and the switching system allows for the introduction of “hot” changes to the PSA structure with continuous preservation of the backup function.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Smart operation</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An important part of the principles of operating the HiDC infrastructure is the ideology of smart self-healing. In </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">one</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> of our past publications, we mentioned the O&amp;M 1-3-5 intelligent platform, which is able to not only detect and analyze an undesirable event in the system, but also offer the administrator several options for a fully automated solution to the problem. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The introspection function allows you to detect problems in about a minute. Three minutes are spent on analysis, and within five minutes proposals are made to change the state of the system.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose a certain operator error led to the formation of a closed loop of processes that reduces the performance of the virtualization farm from 100 to 77%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The data center administrator receives a message on his dashboard that contains a complete visualization of the problem, including a network diagram of the resources affected by the unwanted process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Further, the administrator can proceed to correct the situation manually or use one of several automatic recovery scenarios proposed to him.</font></font><br>

The system knows about 75 such scenarios that can be implemented in less than ten minutes. Moreover, they cover 90% of the problems encountered in data centers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this time, the engineer can calmly answer the calls of concerned customers, being confident that the service will be restored any minute.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New Key Products at HiDC</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to software products, this should include key solutions that operate at the infrastructure level. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, we need to mention the neural processors used in our Atlas AI clusters, as well as servers based on NPU and GPU. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, you can not again mention the Dorado and its record performance in its class, which is enough for many years to come. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is especially true in the post-Soviet space, where, with rare exceptions, it is customary to update something only when it completely stops working. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This explains the life of individual storage systems, reaching ten years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Enormous productivity is necessary for Dorado in order to provide high quality services in ten years.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Innovation in every element</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When choosing specific infrastructure solutions, one should not forget about the architecture and scenarios of its further development. Disparate products from different manufacturers do not guarantee the expected synergistic effect that solutions already optimized for sharing will provide. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The infrastructure must be based on the right technology. "Correct" is including open, providing high throughput, stably functioning at high loads. For data centers, for example, a good ratio of total energy consumption to IT load is important. To achieve all these goals, you need to choose the environment and components. In modern conditions, this also means the ever wider use of artificial intelligence.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to our observations, among strategic customers of Huawei, there are fewer who still do not use machine learning systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without ML, you simply cannot maximize the monetization of the accumulated data.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The monetization system can be different: for banks - the offer of new targeted products, for telecom operators - the provision of individual services and loyalty, for government customers - quality data life cycle management and a high level of interaction with other organizations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, data management models have not been reduced to configuring a firewall and ensuring the network visibility of their databases for a long time.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From an idea to an existing data center</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Building a standard data center at best takes from a year and a half. Our production cycle allows us to do this much faster thanks to the use of a group of solutions, united under the general name FusionDC 2.0. Design, development of a high-level design, assembly of all elements of the IT load are carried out directly at the factory. In a short time, equipment by sea containers is delivered from China to Russia. As a result, the creation of a turnkey data center can be achieved in just four to five months. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The idea of ​​a prefabricated cloud data center is also interesting because it is possible to develop a data center in stages, adding the necessary functional blocks to it. This approach is embedded in the HiDC concept itself.</font></font><br>
