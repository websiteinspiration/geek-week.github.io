It so happened that with the theme agile and scrum I have long and tender feelings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It all started back as a student: start-ups with a complete lack of experience, but with burning eyes, the IIDF pre-acceleration program, cool conferences with celestial speakers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As is often the case with startups: nothing came of our ideas, but for myself I learned the main thing - a business can (and in some cases should) be flexible. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since then, there have been many interesting things in my life: 3 years of experience remotely introducing flexible methodologies with five like-minded colleagues, working as a scrum master in an IT company for 2000+ people, countless books and conferences, a couple of very small projects and ... opening a kotokafe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here I will tell about the last point in more detail.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/er/9r/tg/er9rtgbsidrw5qypgam7wwagek4.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How it all started</font></font></h4> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the source were 3 enthusiasts with no practical business experience, but with the idea of ​​making an anticafe with cats. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The project is primarily social: for the soul and pleasure, so the main goal was self-sufficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the waves of enthusiasm, a business plan was drawn up, investments were calculated, the break-even point and so on, but as soon as it came to the realization of ideas, work traditionally slowed down ...</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Why do we need your agile?” </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My husband (one of three enthusiasts) asked me such a question about my timid attempts to accelerate a new project. “We already know what to do, why do we need additional meetings, and is that all?” - This, by the way, is one of the most popular issues when introducing new approaches to work, relevant for both IT and non-IT companies, so remember it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One way to work out this objection is to show the prospects for development (more precisely, stagnation) with the current approach. Well, when there are 3 organizers in a team, almost inevitably everyone will want to shift responsibility to another. So in a few weeks we have not moved too far off the ground. Self-organization did not work. I had to help her.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The best option is when the team itself managed to feel the “pain” from the lack of a single unified approach to work and itself came to you for help. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in this case, I did not wait for the moment when the intervention would already be vital, since I myself was part of the team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My second attempt to suggest “use some of the practices and ideas from agile and scrum” worked better. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What steps have we taken at this stage:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Started and prioritized the backlog of tasks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, we identified the main blocks of tasks (search and rental of premises, repairs, marketing, design, etc.), then we already painted each of the blocks for individual tasks and determined the order of their execution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Already this simple step helped to restore order in the head and make rough estimates of the terms.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Set up the rhythm of interaction </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An obvious fact - the preparation of a backlog in itself does not ensure the achievement of goals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, I must admit that at least several weeks passed between creating a backlog and starting the rhythm of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first, we naively hoped that everyone would simply take some tasks from the list on their own and do them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it doesn’t work like that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At least in most cases.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So we had a meeting at which a decision was made: </font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Determine the day and time for regular meetings (in essence - set the duration of iterations). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our case, we agreed on iterations of 1 week length. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These meetings did not move and were not canceled.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Build meetings in the format: demonstration of work results + feedback exchange + scheduling tasks for a new iteration with the appointment of those responsible. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We did not use special terminology, although the meetings themselves are very reminiscent of a bunch from scrum: sprint review + retro + sprint planning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, it was one whole meeting with a predetermined agenda, which closed the previous iteration and started a new one.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Having done all this, we were able to better predict the timing, not to forget anything and not to kill each other at the launch stage (which, by the way, is very important). </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/fn/aj/btfnajjdal_spyjowgqgmv-gpoi.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From “We and They” to “We” </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next fascinating stage came at the moment when we began to discuss the approach to working with employees and hire these same employees. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was important for a start to understand among ourselves: how exactly we want to build work in a team. At first, one of the future leaders expressed a desire to keep a distance with employees: “As you know, but I would like them to contact me by name and patronymic.” I remember how at this moment I choked nervously. Maybe because we were all 25, or maybe because I did not know the middle name of any of my previous leaders. “And for work, we will prepare them instructions for all occasions.” All this did not fit in with my idea of ​​how to work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I wanted to make a small but strong team where relations would be built on mutual respect and trust. To make employees feel comfortable and confident. So at this stage we had to work out this moment too: move from the approach “I’m the boss, you are a fool” to the approach “we will work in one team”. It was not so simple, we came to this through long conversations and a search for the root of the problems. It seems to me now that the views of each of us on how to build relationships with employees were determined by the corporate culture in which we still boiled. Someone was brought up by startups, and someone was working in factories. But to transfer the culture of the plant in Kotokafe is not entirely true.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important to remember that our potential employees had some work experience behind their backs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if they had already become accustomed to “you’re the boss, I’m a fool”, then for them teamwork would be stressful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, when choosing employees, we focused on the similarity of views and ideas, the ability to communicate and an approach to solving non-standard tasks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to the usual questions, we proposed problem situations to the applicants and evaluated the solutions they proposed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What we did not pay attention to: diplomas, medals and other regalia. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, we chose the right strategy and took the team of really cool guys with whom it was easy to build further work.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Why is your Agile to employees?” </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Ok, Katya, the list of tasks and general meetings helped us at the opening. Every day we performed non-standard tasks and we needed to share the results. But what does the staff have to do with it? They will have the same type of work, once taught - and in battle. ” - I was asked about this when we were already open, and the question arose about how to build further work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I did not argue. I thought: “But what, there is logic in this. Let everything go as it should. ” Moreover, we spent the first weeks together “in the fields”, side by side with employees: we debugged processes, shared experiences, trained ourselves and trained them, and collected feedback.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fact, everything worked very well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The employees are motivated, do not juggle, cats and guests are satisfied, any issues are resolved promptly - the perfect picture. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And everything was perfect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Until the moment we went on vacation a month after the opening. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For two weeks we worked only in the format of answers to urgent questions in a working chat. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when we returned, rested and happy, in the kotokafe we ​​were met by depressed and confused employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Don't leave us again, please,” they asked plaintively.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/5p/q_/df5pq_kleccf9lgkhdk1ytdiu2e.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We take the best practices and apply in work </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So we went to the first retrospective of the team. They did not artificially introduce a new meeting, but only when they realized that it was necessary. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For more than an hour, we discussed what problems the employees faced, which nevertheless worked out well, and as a result we made a list of improvement steps. And everyone liked this format of interaction, so it was decided to conduct retrospectives every 2 weeks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Later, daily morning mini-reports in the working chat were added to the retrospectives. Usually they were in free form and contained the following information: plans for today; Faced such and such problems, applied such and such a solution, worked / did not work; I need some kind of help (urgent / not urgent). Let the word “report” not scare you, in fact, this information was equally important to us and our employees. For us it is an opportunity to keep abreast, for employees it is an opportunity to highlight problems. This format was somewhat similar to daily scrum, although it was adapted to our specifics.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, on a daily basis, we solved current issues, once every 2 weeks we considered ideas for improving work processes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why didn’t we add, for example, planning and sprint reviews? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, because they would not make any sense. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We took only those practices that were really applicable and useful in our case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And yes, none of the team used the words “agile” and “scrum” in the workflow because:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Applying individual scrum practices does not give you the right to call your workflow a scrum. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The name is not important, the goal is important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the essence of all our meetings was reduced to a process of continuous improvement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And everyone knew about this goal.</font></font></li>
</ul><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/qs/kn/neqsknu6bltpm7lv8epcgwheooy.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What happened next? </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then we gradually came to almost complete autonomy kotokafe. Employees learned everything that was needed to work. We did what we wanted: we gave employees freedom, respected their opinions, supported them. In response, they became the driving force behind this place: they initiated change, proposed and promoted their ideas. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In connection with the move, we were forced to sell a kotokafe. Now he has other owners, the business lives on, the cats continue to delight the guests - and this is really great. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That's just the employees left a month after the change of leadership. They say that after our departure I no longer want to work “differently”. And now we continue to keep in touch with them. Because the team is the second family. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
