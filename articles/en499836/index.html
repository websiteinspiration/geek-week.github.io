<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Please note: an article on the 2018 report at </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ProductSense</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Some processes in the company managed to change, and almost all employees were moved to Minsk.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Appodeal has been on the market since 2015. The company has offices in San Francisco, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãMoscow, Barnaul, Lutsk and Minsk. These are large local centers where IT specialists are concentrated. Moreover, most people still work remotely, because they live in other cities.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Over the past few years, the mobile advertising market has grown several times - it is moving by leaps and bounds and has long overtaken the desktop advertising market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Appodeal is also growing: increasing the number of customers, cash flow and advertising traffic.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to develop products in Appodeal </font></font><br>
</h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sales sell our product as a kind of SaaS solution, so in many respects they have to adapt to strategically important customers. Often this involves individual customization or implementation of certain features. The process of sales and integration often looks quite tough: our solutions and competitors' solutions are tested in the form of A / B tests. The one who turns out to be more productive wins. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our income is built around a certain core - advertising mediation. A service connected to different advertising networks allows the application owner to show the most expensive ads. All other products either revolve around this core, or provide additional competitive advantages. For example, provide access to advanced analytics and statistics.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The integration period for large customers can last several months. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is due to the very A / B tests and strict direct comparisons with competitors that I spoke about. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We formulate product requirements in several ways:</font></font><br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Directly during the sale. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the help of custom research: we find out directly what customers are willing to pay for. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We develop products based on our accumulated technical expertise. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In practice, this means that we look to the future and try to determine where the market is moving.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Due to the large remote team and complex processes, we do not always get the desired result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we try to simplify the chain from the customer to the developer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At a certain point, we realized: in order to maintain the company's growth rate, we need to raise the bar for quality and speed.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Four Remote Development Issues </font></font><br>
</h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We faced four main problems that prevented us from increasing speed and improving the quality of development. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/td/up/3j/tdup3jfgh5zb2bd5hgk4lvw9y4g.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first problem is communication.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Our offices and employees work in different time zones - Moscow, San Francisco and Barnaul. There is a rule: everyone should get in touch and interact at certain time intervals, but it does not always work. For example, to talk with colleagues from San Francisco, you need to schedule a call after six to seven in the evening, or before nine to ten in the morning, Moscow time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mf/on/kq/mfonkqiczi81l0gbmetok8r1m5k.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We tried to experiment: we brought developers and managers to an office in Barcelona and noticed that with team work in one or two weeks it is possible to solve those tasks that cannot be performed qualitatively on a remote site. But gathering 120 people together is not very flexible, convenient and cheap. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second problem is related to processes.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Ideally, remote work should go like this: the leader set the task to the developer or manager, he completed it on time and reported. This requires a certain degree of training and responsibility from the employee. If there are ten such employees, this is one alignment. But the larger the team, the more difficult it is to build an effective work process.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Initially, there were mixed teams in Appodeal: the same developers could work on different products. But with this approach, the focus of attention was sprayed, so we began to create product teams. Such teams work more efficiently. At the same time, we compared similar teams working on the remote and in the office. It turned out that office give a better result. The concentration of people around the products correlates very well with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir physical being in one place.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/se/i5/6b/sei56bslomhwdoir2gsqafbd3iy.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To measure performance and compare the results of a remote and office team, we chose simple metrics. Firstly, the number of successful clients that we have attracted over a certain period. Secondly, the speed of completing tasks - it is important here whether we hit the deadlines or not. Thirdly, the number of similar products made on the remote and in the office. Based on the foregoing, we concluded that we need to unite. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The third problem is flexibility.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unlike enterprises, startups are flexible companies. We started as a small team of 10‚àí20 people without product managers, and this did not prevent us from working. But with the advent of more people, we began to lose flexibility. Feedback suffered the most. It is very important for a company where they constantly test many hypotheses, adapt to a changing market and adapt to new customers with special requirements. And if you need to urgently solve a problem, and an employee in another time zone is sleeping, you have to change something. At a minimum, transfer an employee to the same time zone. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fourth problem is engineering culture.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order for developers to develop, you need to regularly hold meetings and conferences, exchange experiences and write technical articles. This is especially important for the development of new technologies that should be better than competitor technologies. Employees on a remote site often do not associate themselves with the development team and do not share experience. They simply work off the set hours and do the work within the set tickets. This approach may be good, but not for the product team. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nk/pd/og/nkpdoglcruosywf86zuaov4tavs.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Informal communication is almost completely absent or comes down to the exchange of memes in Slack. Some techniques, such as Agile or pair programming, are generally difficult to do on a remote site.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When more than three people are recruited in one city, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an office arises on its own. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, people themselves come to coworking to work together. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A good example is the office in Barnaul, where we have a concentrated technical support team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About 30 people work there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turns out that we were able to create an efficiently working team with low turnover and a good microclimate in a small town. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the general congresses, we realized that problems with communication, processes and the formation of culture are being addressed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the more ideas arise, the more difficult it is to unite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some practices improve local processes, but do not solve global goals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, often the most correct decision may be moving key development employees to one city.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f3/h7/mk/f3h7mkdp8-nwstmxsigksju0hme.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How we moved key employees </font></font><br>
</h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When choosing a city to move a team, you need to consider many factors, including economic and legal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We preferred Minsk - one of the most comfortable million-plus cities, at least in the CIS countries. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An office is not cheap, but there are special economic zones around the world, including in Russia and Belarus. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the High-Tech Park in Minsk. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such zones give residents a reduced tax rate and simplify legal formalities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They help reduce the degree of pain when moving a few dozen people to the office.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We moved to the Minsk office of managers and developers who participated in the creation of key products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to this, we improved processes, began to remodel less, and faster to finish products with which there were difficulties on the remote. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turns out that we managed to cope with the main problem.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The office in Minsk is often used as a platform for general congresses: here we bring employees to meetings, training, and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, we managed to get off the ground many difficult issues, for example, technical debt.</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there are also disadvantages, for example, it turned out to be more difficult to find people in the office than to remotely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first, the remote team allowed us to expand rapidly, to find specialists of any profile for an acceptable time and money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is much more difficult and expensive to transfer employees to work in Minsk: not everyone can or wants to move. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some cannot for personal reasons, others live by stereotypes and do not want to move to Belarus. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Someone is worried about elderly parents who remain in another country, or is experiencing health problems, so they are forced to live where they are being treated.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote>   ,   -   -,     . ,       ,      . <br>
</blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I moved from St. Petersburg to Minsk with my wife and two children. I can‚Äôt say that the family is somehow stopping the move. The company provides medical insurance, private kindergartens and other things necessary for a comfortable life in a new place. Nevertheless, employees who agree to relocate have to be additionally motivated: to raise salaries and promise different ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, we came to the conclusion that the best option is a mixed one. This works for us from top to bottom: there is more benefit from the managers in the office, ordinary specialists can work remotely. Employees with a high degree of responsibility show the best result, working in the office next to the team. If the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility is small, you can leave the person on the remote. So you get more profit and save money.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What happened 1.5 years after the move</font></font><br>
</h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I spoke at the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ProductSense</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> conference </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">with this report in 2018. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over the past time, we have made several additional conclusions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, we measured very little performance before and after moving to the office. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First you need to build measurable processes, and then make a decision about the format of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a non-trivial task, and few can boast of neatly collected numbers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Secondly, on an intuitive level, we did the right thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Work in the office allows you to feel team spirit and unite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Employees constantly communicate with each other, share new knowledge and approaches, gather for professional meetings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Engineering culture is developing strongly through informal communication.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thirdly, in order for office work to lead to good results, you need to organize it at a certain level. The office itself must meet certain needs: convenient workplaces, comfortable meeting rooms, a kitchen and free lunches. The administrative part is one of the most complex. For the Minsk office, I had to hire a CEO, who was under the entire administrative and legal burden. An additional recruiter, an office manager and accountants were also needed to help with the relocation of employees. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Appodeal did not focus solely on office work. Although most now work in Minsk, there are offices in the United States and Barcelona. If the need arises, any employee can work outside the office. The main thing is that the processes are established, and other specialists do not suffer because of this.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the processes are not established, then it will be like self-isolation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some companies were forced to switch to remote work, but people don‚Äôt know what Slack and Zoom are, how to share a screen or make a presentation on the Internet.</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To summarize: it is worth taking the best from both formats of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to focus on the needs of business, processes and people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you cannot find a suitable specialist in your city, consider relocation or remote work options. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, for Minsk this is a rather popular story: companies are looking for employees all over the world and build work based on the specific situation.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">findings</font></font></h2><br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A large remote team and complex processes do not allow to increase the speed and quality of development. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are several problems in remote development: it is difficult to communicate in different time zones, to be flexible and effective with a large distributed team, and to form an engineering culture in the absence of informal communication. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The solution may be a mixed version of the work, in which people with a larger area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility work in the office, and with less - remotely. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is better to choose an office in a comfortable millionaire city, taking into account economic, legal and other factors. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs not always easy to transfer a remote team to an office: some people refuse, some have to raise their salaries, while others leave them on a remote site. </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
