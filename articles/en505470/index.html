<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It so happened that this spring I got a job as a knowledge management manager at Exness and, using a living example, I saw how knowledge management really works in a company with a large headquarters of developers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am pleased to tell you about my first days at the company, about what I met there and what I have never seen in Russian IT.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mq/d6/66/mqd666ephv_tmanmh5d-xqostw4.png"><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It all started with the fact that I got a job in a fintech company Exness ...</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When you hear the word fintech, you probably expect that now there will be something about exchanges, trading and development. Exness's business as a fintech company, of course, is based on online trading technologies: a trading platform, a payment system, various applications and programs for the B2C segment and more complex solutions for the B2B market. The company pays great attention to product quality. But producing a good product is not enough to be a leader. You need to keep track of the huge amount of news and changes taking place both in the world and within the company, competently communicate with customers and provide decent service. This is probably why the work of the Knowledge Management team in the company is put on an official footing, supported by management and is actively developing.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today we will talk about knowledge management, its importance for business and the image of the company, and how it can work without a thousand questions “Why?”. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To begin with, Exness is an international company with more than 600 employees and several offices. It is based in Cyprus, lives according to European legislation and works according to Western methods, although more than half of the employees are Russian-speaking, including CEO. Why am I focusing on this? A curious fact: in the three months of searching for work, I have not seen a single vacancy of a knowledge management specialist posted by a Russian IT company. Not one, Karl! There are no such vacancies on hh.ru. But it’s worth opening LinkedIn and at the request of the “knowledge manager” you can see 6.5 thousand (!) Offers.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And these statistics are reflected in the work of Exness. This idea came to my mind during an interview with the future leader, when the question: “What will be my main goals?” they answered me: “We have now hired one knowledge manager in our office in Asia, but we need another in Cyprus to provide continuous support for the knowledge of follow the sun employees.” Have you ever heard from at least one Russian IT company that it is considering the idea of ​​hiring several people who can give an answer or initiate a search for information within the company at any time?&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even then, I very much wanted to get this position, got it, and on the very first day of onboarding a new positive surprise awaited me. In the group of newcomers was another knowledge manager. But if I went to a position in the Training and Quality division, then he was in Internal Communications. Its main goal was to establish communications for the transfer of knowledge between departments and a quick search of information within the company based on the KCS (Knowledge-Centered Service) methodology.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since this is my long-standing belief that knowledge management is a function of internal communication, I was delighted to find out that Exness shared my point of view.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the IT world, there is a widespread belief that knowledge management is about how to properly dock a repository. In a slightly more advanced form - about how to write articles in the knowledge base. But actually it’s about how to manage all the knowledge available in the company in order to allow all employees to find answers to questions as quickly as possible, make decisions, avoid mistakes, come up with something new, manage projects, select and develop employees. So, you need to build communication between units, teach them how to talk to each other. Just putting a dock in Confluence - doesn't work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, at the time of the first day in the company, I already knew that I have a colleague who works with a shift of +6 hours, and with whom we must allocate time zones, as well as a second colleague in the intercom, who will help us communicate with other units and make knowledge transfer extremely easy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I guess I will surprise you, but three is not limited to three people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to three full-time knowledge management managers, the company also has a whole team of six people, partially engaged in this activity (and officially having KPIs related to the strategic goals of the company), as well as its own knowledge managers in support and an external base knowledge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A total of more than 10. 10+ knowledge management specialists for 600+ employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would be pleasantly surprised if any Russian IT company would tell how it hired a comparable staff of knowledge workers, as I realized that this would help it speed up many business processes and eliminate a number of risks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, there are only a few such companies in the country.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How it works?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is often said that IT people vote with their feet: if they don’t like something, they just leave the company or don’t use something, or don’t follow such rules. At the same time, IT often forget that the client also votes with their feet: simply by buying a product, a person does not become an eternal client. There are many competitors, no one will carry their money by default. And no matter how good the product may be, however much it outstrips competitors in terms of features, performance, interface friendliness and loyalty programs, customers may have questions. Simple questions: “How to set up?”, “Where to read the terms?”, “Why is this checkmark here?”, Or more difficult situations arise: the payment failed, the website freezes, the product is duplicated in the basket. And here the service comes to the fore. IT often does not think about how important the image-building component of a service is:cut bones and a head account, distribute the budget according to the residual principle. But the product will not support itself, and the client will simply stop using it after a couple of chats with incompetent support (or 10 minutes of waiting for a free operator).&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At Exness, service units carry weight. The business understands how important it is for the client to be able to contact at any time and receive quality assistance quickly. Even if something goes wrong with the person, but he knows that he can always trust the brand, he will remain loyal to the company and will not go to the competitors.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Service can be live - chats, call center. Then people sitting on the phone need to be trained as deeply as possible on the company's products and as quickly as possible to notify of any changes that could potentially affect customers. Who will do this? The agents themselves have no time, because there is always at least one client in the queue. There is no time for food headquarters - they need to write code and make releases on time in order to be ahead of the competition. Here’s a lesson for the knowledge management manager: keep abreast, keep abreast of all updates, quickly update the knowledge base, scripts and response templates, notify about upcoming updates, prepare trainings for beginners (and update them also on an ongoing basis), always know where, what information in the company can be found.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Service can be self. Self-service is a client knowledge base, FAQ, product descriptions, user documentation for them, etc., that is, everything that helps the client solve the problem on their own. Who will regularly and quickly replenish and update the external knowledge base? Developers? Tech Writers? And how do they know what questions most often arise from clients? To do this, you need to regularly monitor and analyze incoming questions, monitor the relevance of hundreds of pages. And here the knowledge management manager will be very helpful. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And who will help the knowledge manager get this knowledge quickly and regularly? That's right, another knowledge manager is the one that is in internal communications. The term "Continuous delivery" is also very useful for knowledge management. Once the knowledge manager should</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">always</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> be aware of what's new in the company, which means that he </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">must </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">always</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> have a tool to learn about changes. And most importantly, it should not be hindered by the knowledge holders themselves.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my past practice, I regularly had to deal with a huge number of questions like: “Why do you need to know this?”. Exness doesn't. Everyone knows that if the knowledge manager asks, then the client has already asked about this at least once. And customers vote with their feet ...&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everything is organized simply: the knowledge management team has special chats, one for each product team, where 2-3 representatives of this product team live. Usually this is a product owner, business analyst and someone else. Knowledge managers write a question there, representatives of the product team respond. Nothing complicated, as you can see. The main idea is that in these chats they answer all questions as quickly as possible. If knowledge managers asked, this is urgent. If earlier I often came across the fact that my questions were simply ignored, or they were answered after a couple of weeks, or even a month, then here a delay is possible only if all the representatives of the team are busy at the same meeting (or sleeping).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This works the other way around. In the same chats (or in JIRA), product teams inform in advance about an upcoming release and talk about the changes. “In advance” means “for a sufficient period of time for knowledge managers to update their materials, inform services, an external knowledge base and everyone who is affected by the changes, and those, in turn, have prepared all the changes at the time of release.” At first glance, the chain is long. But when it is a systematic process, a few working days are more than enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It’s not enough to put knowledge in the base. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Knowledge must work, delivered to employees in need on time and in full. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the answers of product teams do not remain on chat rooms and on Confluence pages: training programs are created on their basis so that all (I emphasize, all) company employees regularly refresh their knowledge about products, trading conditions, markets, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, any changes that may in one way or another raise questions from customers are announced in a special group on the internal portal.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why teach everyone?</font></font></h4> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I agree, the issue has a right to exist. I will explain. When a person just comes to Exness, he takes a two-week training in forex and company products. Why such a training for a knowledge manager is understandable. But why is it for developers, for example? It’s easy for them to write code, but that’s not all. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I understood the answer to this question when we had a Demo day, and my comrades in the onboarding group, newcomers to the company: PMs, developers talked about new features of their products on it. It was a week after the end of onboarding, and they talked as if for years they worked not so much in fintech, but specifically in Exness. They orientated themselves in products as if they had been involved in their creation for a long time, used relevant terminology.&nbsp;</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main KPI for onboarding is considered to be the speed of a novice reaching certain expected production capacities. The speed of entry into the realities of the company and the scope of its activities at Exness, as I have seen from my own experience, is very high. Do you think that if any employee of your company is ready in three weeks to tell in detail how your product works, why such decisions were made, and what is the benefit for customers here, is this good for business? The answer, it seems to me, is obvious. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I can say from my own example that this really works. Almost the next day after the end of my onboarding, the company's trainers began to come to me to clarify something or ask to deduct their new training. And surprisingly, I really could do it and be useful, although it would seem where I and forex?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the world is constantly changing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is happening now in the financial markets - everyone sees (some negative oil prices are worth it!), Because after some time the knowledge of employees is already starting to lag behind reality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So what? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's right, you need to tell them about what's new. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And who can make the sammari of change? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's right, a specialist in working with knowledge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As soon as we receive some information important for business, we record it in the knowledge base, and then announce it on the internal portal in the section specially designated for this.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where are we going to move on?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, we still have something to work on (otherwise the company would not have hired three new knowledge management managers for the quarter).&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, most of the communication between employees goes through chat rooms or at meetings (in remote conditions - at conf-calls). Many are used to asking questions personally to the guys in the knowledge management team or trainers. So that answers to questions do not settle in private chat rooms, but are available to a large number of employees, you need to promote a publicly accessible group specially created for questions to the knowledge management team on the internal portal. We need to work on the speed of response from the knowledge management team to such questions, because, as I said, if someone asks us a question, it means that the client came to him with this question. And customers do not like to wait long for help.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, the task of internal promotion of knowledge management for Exness is relevant, and probably in the next quarter it will become one of our main areas of work. We will work to ensure that more people share their knowledge on their own initiative, so that people are better oriented in internal information systems and can quickly find the required information. We will create additional channels for notification of changes: for example, more actively use email, create digests of changes and conduct peculiar demos for interested teams.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is also an important task to synchronize the use of terms on external and internal information portals (in the knowledge base, on the corporate website, in the client help center). Over the past few months, a lot of changes have occurred, and the information has not been updated everywhere. So that clients and employees do not get confused in the concepts used, you need to work on the consistency of their use, synchronize the slang that has developed within the company with the terms common in the world of finance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, probably, the most important thing now is positioning knowledge management as an internal service, identifying specific target audiences, in addition to support, sales support and internal trainers, a deeper understanding of their needs in terms of obtaining and using knowledge, and creating clear interaction processes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are a lot of challenges, as you see. However, the most important thing in Exness already exists is the culture of knowledge sharing. Employees do not resist this process, understand its value and are ready to support the knowledge management team in its activities. Namely, the lack of an appropriate culture factor is most often the main problem in Russian-language IT. The issue here is not only that experts do not understand why someone outside their small world needs to be told what they did, when and how. This, of course, is a barrier to knowledge sharing.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there is another big problem - distrust of non-core specialists. I observe this not only in IT. A specialist can be a developer, financier, lawyer, driller, anyone. They all ask one question: “Do you understand something in &lt;their sphere of activity&gt;? Do you have a specialized education? How then can you be trusted to engage in professional knowledge? ”&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What can I say in response ... Of course, these people are right. The problem is that: </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
a) They themselves don’t have time to sit down and record their knowledge, and even more so to transfer and conduct something to someone on a regular basis, monitor data synchronization on all company resources, because they need to code, sell, monitor trends and quickly change business strategy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
b) They, for the most part, are not very experts in the field of technical writing (and writing in general), pedagogical design (in order to correctly pack the meaning for conveying to the target audience), teaching (in order to chew all incomprehensible moments to beginners), internal communications (in order to to know where it’s better to put the article, how best to tell the rest of the company about it, which channels are better to use, etc.) and many others.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The knowledge manager, of course, is not a specialist in your professional field, he will never understand it better than you. But this is a person who always has time to create knowledge (this is his job responsibilities, in the end), who knows how to work with information, knows the problems of all departments, the literacy level of employees, knows how to translate information from your professional language into plain language for mortals "dialect". Also, the knowledge management manager will always ask questions until he understands everything. And after that he will ask a question, does he understand everything correctly? If you managed to explain your topic to the knowledge manager, then now everyone else will understand it.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also remember that, unlike you, the knowledge manager has the ability to immediately monitor all the information sources in the company, receive information that you yourself do not know, find inconsistencies in different materials and clean them up. The knowledge manager, as a system with a large number of sensors, receives data feeds from all departments, analyzes them, sees the risks that may arise if some information is not conveyed to someone or if data is not synchronized in two different channels (for example, on the company's website and in technical support training).&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Knowledge managers should be trusted, they carry out work that you will never have time to do yourself, and they will certainly not deliver unverified information about the company. Write your products, sell them, and know that you have a person in your company (preferably 10+ people, as in Exness), who will always record all changes and updates for you.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You can write about many other examples of how knowledge management helps a development company. I settled on these because they are probably the most obvious and at the same time poorly understood by the IT community.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we talk about what I personally managed to do and why I had a hand in less than two months of work, then, first of all, this is updating the content in the knowledge base. As I said above, over the past six months, the company has undergone a lot of changes, and the database, which now has more than 300 pages, required careful proof reading. No promo and diversification of content delivery channels can be compared in importance with its relevance. So it took a lot of time. By the way, it seems to me that if a person who first encountered financial markets two months ago can read content without losing quality, this is a very significant result of quality onboarding.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I also started collecting feedback from our customers and analytics on the use of resources. If you want to make your service better (and knowledge management is an internal service), ask its customers what they are missing. Surveys and web analytics help with this. Based on the results of the analysis of the satisfaction and impact of our various actions on the attendance of various articles of the database, it has already been possible to outline some further steps and draw up a draft version of the development strategy for our activity, which we will continue to discuss with the team and put into practice.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In conclusion: colleagues, if you still think that spending money on a knowledge management manager (or rather several) is a waste of money, ask your own colleagues from other departments: marketing, support, sales, Social Media, what they lack to start working even better. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I’m almost sure that they will all say that they don’t know something / don’t know on time or don’t understand about the company’s business and products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a sure indicator that it’s time to devote time to knowledge management.&nbsp;</font></font></div>
