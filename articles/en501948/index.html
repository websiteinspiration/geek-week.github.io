<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The architecture of the railway is a rather interesting thing from the point of view of </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">routing</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> principles </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. There is a stage - a certain linear route from one node to another, for example, from a passing point to a station. Trains can be followed only by turns, without overtaking each other and not “touching”. Routing is mostly done at separate points. That is, you can only ride or stand on the stage.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is divided into block sections. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A block section is a small stretch of haul, most often from a traffic light to a traffic light. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a normal situation, only one train can be on one block section. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, if there is someone on the block site now, a prohibitory signal is lit at its beginning, which does not allow the next train to call on it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And on the block, before that, yellow is lit, limiting the maximum speed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, there are exceptions, such as the situation when you need to push an electric train left without power (and need to call under the red one), but we will now talk about how it works in simplified cases.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Signals</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The driver in the cab receives signals into his brain. By responding correctly to them, he can conduct the train safely and on time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Signals enter the driver’s brain through the eyes, ears and, sometimes, tactilely. For example, the explosion of a signal </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">firecracker</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (they are put on the way in front of the emergency train) is felt by the sound and vibration of the locomotive. But firecrackers are considered an audible alarm. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Traffic lights</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> can be seen. Occasionally, semaphores come across (these are waving, not shining), you can still see shields, lights, flags, and so on. Locomotive whistles, voice informants, sirens and beeps can be heard. There are old branches like Kuvshinovo, where the semaphore seems to have been preserved, but I haven’t been working with the machine for a long time, so I can’t say for sure.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here is another example: when the railway workers work on the site, the signal sign is put at the beginning of the work site - a yellow shield. It is installed from the beginning of the work site. If you see this, it means that there will be people on the roads. There is a speed limit. After a while, the signal sign is round: “the beginning of a dangerous place”, then “the end of a dangerous place” - the end passed, but should not immediately accelerate, because there are cars behind you. We need everyone to leave at the same speed, and only then the sign of the green shield - you can accelerate. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The lantern</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is the night version of the flag. And you could see the flags at the conductors. As soon as the landing is completed, they wave the green flag. Grandmother with a cart fell under the platform - a red flag. And at night the red lamp. The assistant sees the red and does not go. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sound</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- for example, when a locomotive whistles three times, it is about to stop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two times - moves back. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One is forward.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Set off</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When the driver wants to leave the starting station, the station attendant first gives permission. In general, a lot of what is done manually, because it requires control. The same arrows are usually controlled from the remote control, automatic (dispatch centralization) is rarely used. But you can leave the station specifically for another set of conditions: if the output signal is open, and it is your time in the schedule. In fact, the dispatcher opens the output signal. That is, most often - turns on the green traffic light. And immediately duplicates the command for radio communication into the cockpit - “The output signal is open” (not for everyone, usually high-speed trains). The driver is obliged to confirm receipt of the dispatcher’s order to depart the train by repeating a voice command - “Accepted. The output is open. We are leaving. " Well, if the dispatcher did not call, he just goes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Further, the train should linearly follow the stage, but without getting too close to the </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
train </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ahead of him: </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the train passes a traffic light, it immediately switches to red. This means that you cannot call into this block section. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Switching to the red output traffic light in the block section (the train has left the section) switches the input to yellow. Switching the output to yellow switches the input to green. The output traffic light of one section is itself the input for the next, and is called the traffic light. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is, it is forbidden to call into the block section with another train. On the site behind him, you need to move slowly. On the site through one you can move at any speed within the reasonable and permissible. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This system is called auto-lock, easier -</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">auto lock</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Once upon a time, long ago there was only a three-digit, as above. And there is a four-digit one, now often between yellow and green one more intermediate traffic light is added with two lights, yellow and green. It is just for information that the next signal limits. That speed did not add up. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Metro driving, pay attention to the indications of traffic lights. On the example of the subway, the self-locking operation is clearly visible, although the block sections in the subway are much shorter than on the railway, but the algorithm for triggering the automation is the same.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The principle of operation of the auto-lock is based on the transmission of a coded electrical signal according to the indications of a traffic light on a rail circuit. The signal is encoded in the encoder, which can be found in the relay box at each traffic light.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An automatic braking control system (SAUT) is tied to auto-lock. It is installed at the entrance and entrance traffic lights. It measures the speed of the rolling stock in accordance with traffic signals. SAUT is needed to automatically enable braking on rolling stock. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The device of signaling and interlocking systems (centralization systems, alarm systems, interlocks), transformer traffic light box.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This is the first generation of automation, now it is already considered almost an archeology, almost everywhere there are CLUBs. Of the important CLUB, it differs from SAUT in that the main unit of measurement and processing is located in the cab, and not at the traffic light.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How does the locomotive team recognize the next traffic light without seeing it yet? In the cab of each locomotive, electric or diesel train, a locomotive traffic light and a decoder are installed (now it is at the CLUB). Receiving coils located on the locomotive below, above the railroad tracks, read electromagnetic codes from the rails and transmit them to the decoder. The decoder, receiving electrical impulses, processes them and sends a signal to a locomotive traffic light. So there is a transmission of automatic locomotive signaling (ALS). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Traffic from a traffic light always goes through a locomotive.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is, the signal is fed directly along the rails and is read by the locomotive using the first pair of wheels that closes the circuit. More precisely, the coils above it. Train, traffic light and rails always form a closed circuit. There is no signal beyond the train. There are exceptions with just two signals in front and behind, but this is for special situations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the driver is mistaken or some kind of accident occurs, the automatic alarm simply does not allow to perform a potentially dangerous action. If the train nevertheless passes a red inhibit signal without the permission of the dispatcher, the ALS will work. And the train will automatically go into emergency braking mode to prevent a collision or derailment in the event of a track malfunction.</font></font><br>
 <br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Which signal is shown at the forward traffic light, the same is duplicated at the locomotive traffic light in the driver’s cab. White signal - the next section is not encoded. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Green light - follow with the set speed, yellow light up - attention, you can follow the traffic light with a yellow signal at a speed of no higher than 60 km / h. The passage of the red signal is a violation, with all the ensuing consequences for the locomotive brigade (except for situations that are allowed to do so according to the instructions).</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On inactive sections of the railways, the so-called semi-automatic locking works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There, on the hauls between stations, there are no passing traffic lights and block sections. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Until the moving train follows the entire stage and arrives at the next station, the train following it will stand at the station and wait, it will not go to the stage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our suburbs on the Konakovskaya branch, this was before. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What is the throughput of such a site? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, not very high. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's why you need to send more packets! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So auto-blocking and blocking into block sections made it possible to significantly increase the throughput of railways.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Priorities for movement ahead of rolling stock</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Passenger trains have priority. When it is necessary to get ahead of the freight train, the passenger driver contacts to coordinate the lead with the dispatcher of the track section or the station duty officer. After coordination, the freight train stops at the station, the passenger is ahead of it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are many priorities. High-speed trains beat fast, fast beat fast, fast beat ordinary passenger, ordinary passenger more important than suburban, and in the end freight. Still there are all sorts of strange exceptions like government trains, whose priority exceeds the maximum value of int.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When it is necessary to make an advance not at the station, but on the stage, then the driver together with the duty dispatcher of the block section of the track selects a section that is convenient for the advance. For this, the driver has a map of haul profiles to select the most convenient and safest section of the track to resume movement from the stopping point, taking into account the train weight. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here the driver goes on a freight train with gasoline, he has 60 wagons. The dispatcher says - the passenger is behind you, it’s necessary to take you to overtake (but he won’t say so directly, but the simple one will remove it with the words “route to the side way”). The driver will perform. The profile map is important for this reason: if the freeway is from the station, and its length is only 30 cars, then our gasoline will not fit. So, then you need to go to another point where you can already fit.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is a “right” and “wrong” direction of movement on each stage to make a lead. In the right direction, trains move at traffic lights. And in the wrong direction (oncoming) they move not at traffic lights, but according to the readings of the ALS in the locomotive cab. Changing the direction of movement on the stage is possible in exceptional cases and only with the participation of two persons on duty at the stations (DSP) that control this stage.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A rare case indeed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a double track. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The right way is busy with your train. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You are taken on the stage oncoming lane, this is the "wrong" way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All oncoming traffic stops, you ride in splendid isolation, trying to understand what it was. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here - suck! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sapsan arriving late somewhere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, at the end of the stretch, you go back to the correct one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, there is already a “traffic jam” of those who were supposed to go the other way, but priority routing is priority routing.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Radio communication</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone uses radio communications: locomotive drivers, station attendants, train dispatchers, passenger train managers, depot attendants, and so on, almost all services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">HF and VHF bands.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The radio communication service on the railroads is the responsibility of the communications service - the frequency band and regional communication centers - the RCS. In the production of shunting, communication takes place in exactly the same way, but at a different frequency so that shunting does not interfere with the train. In the event of a failure or malfunction, there are always backup ranges and channels. If the locomotive completely fails the radio connection, the driver must bring the train to the first station, stop the train there, verbally report the problem to the station attendant, and together with the train dispatcher, a decision is made to continue the train with the locomotive with good radio communication. The dispatcher may give an order how to proceed with a faulty connection.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All radio stations give radio communications over long distances and with all involved. Train drivers can talk with each other, with station attendants, with the train dispatcher, with the train commander, without any interference or problems. Sapsans have their own frequency, now they are not heard by everyone. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the radio, you can call a doctor or police from the nearest stations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From Moscow it was possible to call Petersburg if desired. It just won’t work out: it’s all written, if you send someone on the air, there will be a resolution and a reprimand. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like this.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hops are that between routing points. They are divided into segments of block sections, each of which can normally have only one train. This is equipped with an automatic control system and is checked by different people - at least the driver and dispatcher. Everything is safe and logical right at the protocol level. </font></font><br>
