The well-known Russian journalist, host of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the Tochka program</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on Echo of Moscow radio about Internet and technology, as well as the author of the Deutsche Welle column, Alexander Plyushchev, gave Roskomsvoboda an interview. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He has been working on the topic of the Internet since the 90s, so he has a good understanding of the development of the Web over the past twenty years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander shared with us his vision of the mutual influence of politics and the Runet, how Zharov’s trick differs from Yandex’s trick, why Klishas and Bokova do not pay attention to criticism, do users have a request for personal data protection and can artificial intelligence reproduce Shenderovich. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And also - that lately he was really impressed.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Runet and politics</font></font></h2><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“People who are in control were born in the pre-Internet era”</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Alexander, you have a fairly wide range of topics on which you, as a journalist, work. This is politics, and public topics, and the Internet, and gadgets. When did you start, I suppose, politics and the Internet went separately? We can say that these two topics are increasingly intersecting now, and personal on the Internet is now political?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The Internet in Russia began to develop in 1995-1996, I dealt with it closely in 1998. Not everyone back then even knew what the Internet was, and my role was more likely to be enlightening, I talked about it. Now that everyone knows what the Internet is (77% of Russia's population </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">has access to the Internet from home</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- approx. Ed.), any state cannot but pay attention to it. Therefore, everything related to the Internet is becoming the subject of state interest, and if so, then this is politics in one form or another. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why does the Russian government have such a great interest in the Internet and technology? And the digital economy is a national project in our country, and they want electronic voting, and much more is indicative. Not all countries have that.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I can’t compare, but I agree, yes, in Russia they pay great attention to the Internet. There are two reasons for this. First, our technologies are developing well thanks to bright heads and a very good education in mathematics and programming. Unlike many countries, Russia has its own companies that have succeeded not only in the domestic market, but also globally actively compete with transnational American companies. This is Yandex, Kaspersky Lab, ABBYY. Not bad for a country with a relatively small market and population. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second reason is that Russia is an authoritarian, autocratic state, its control issues are very interested. If the Internet becomes a political factor, it must also be controlled.</font></font><br>
<blockquote>« 2010-        ,     ,         ».</blockquote> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But Putin does believe that the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Internet is a CIA project</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Therefore, one can imagine that mass communications are of great importance for the state. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“The Russian authorities see the Internet as a powerful aggravating circumstance,” </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">you </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wrote</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in one of the articles. And why is the fear of the Internet in power? The question may seem trite, but on the other hand, sofa critics are often only sofa critics, why should they be afraid?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
People who are in control were born in the pre-Internet era. They generally do not understand what self-regulation is. For example, Wikipedia has no editor in chief, no editorial advice - no one determines what to write. And </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">officials do not understand</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are network horizontal structures without a leader. They were born in the 50s and lived a great life without the Internet, they have black and white ideas about the world in general. The Internet is a mysterious thing. Putin does not use it and has little idea what it is. “Why do I need Facebook when I have an FSB.” And these people make decisions. What generation is in power, such and such decisions. Not even in the age sense, but in the worldview. There are young people, but they behave the same way. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Will this change in the future?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think this is inevitable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I'm not sure that your grandchildren will be able to find this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, everything may change in the near future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The problem, however, is that we look at other deputies and think that they are morons, and so for twenty years already. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this time, a couple of generations have changed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From somewhere new young people come who are brought up in the same system of values, despite the fact that their whole life has passed with the Internet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, the environment apparently determines consciousness. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“It also turns out that the system cannot generate other models.” </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Locks, censorship, personal data</font></font></h2><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Everything related to the taking of money from the population is developing at an incredible pace: taxes, parking, banking, food delivery”</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- If we talked about officials and digitalization, then the next question. Do you agree that Mishustin improved the Federal Tax Service through a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">digital reform</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
My acquaintances, businessmen are happy about this, it has become easier for them in reporting. I don’t know, for business, maybe it works. Mishustin from the Stone Age brought the ministry digitally, that's true. Another thing is that relations between people have not changed. For example, you cannot solve the arisen problem online, it is necessary to address in tax. What happens in this tax? There, the operator looks at the computer, just as you would look at home, and says that it is not clear how this thing works. And sends you to leadership. But leadership, for example, is not.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Digitalization looks good, but so far nothing has happened. During a failure, at best, you will be able to get yours back with big fights. And nothing is ever decided in favor of the citizen. As a rule, everything is decided in favor of the state. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In other countries, however, no better. Europe and the United States have their own bureaucracy, and technological progress is very peculiar. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, I would not say that in 2020, digitalization begets a miracle, and we must carry Mishustin in our arms and therefore forgive him, for example, corruption suspicions. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Does “digitization” threaten the government now?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
I do not know. In general, everything related to the taking of money from the population is developing at an incredible pace: taxes, parking, banking, food delivery.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- About other representatives of the authorities. Why do you think it was Bokova and Klishas who suddenly blew up legislation at once with several high-profile laws - on sovereignty, fakes, disrespect, and others? And despite the fact that each time they experience a strong negative impact through the media, they still introduce new laws to tighten the Internet and technology. They reconciled that they act as cannon fodder and work out an expensive government order, or do not know what they are doing, or sincerely believe that their laws strengthen sovereignty and effectively fight evil?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
They are in the service. What they ordered, they did. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- That is, all this is not even their ideas?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am absolutely sure of that. It is possible that they are taking an active part in this. But it doesn’t bother me much. I think they are like a wheel in a car that just spins, but they do not spin on their own, they are spun by the engine. Personally, I do not dislike them. Besides the moment that even if you are in the service, you need to argue your position. A senator cannot be non-public, in my opinion. They are terribly afraid of contacts with the press and talk only if everything is pre-arranged. They do not answer real questions. This shows that they do not believe in their position. However, perhaps this is normal for a soldier, who is the main thing to fulfill the order. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The question is about another public person from the government. Remember, last year, the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov at some point </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">recognized</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that locking resources is an inefficient method. Before that, he </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">claimed</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that blocking Telegram is a matter of time. Do you think he really realized the inefficiency of the methods? And does this lead to the abolition of locks or to new methods of "repression"?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Alexander Zharov is a wonderful, wonderful and touching trickster. In my opinion, this person is ideal as a censorship agency. The combination of his “professionalism” (knowledge and ability to attract specialists who still cannot block Telegram) and his diligence allows the Internet to breathe more or less freely. Without a balance between these qualities, the Internet would be more difficult. Zharov portrays vigorous activity wonderfully, and the media help him in this when they discuss his actions and sometimes even scold him.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's see: Telegram works, Twitter works. The first, of course, thanks to the efforts of Durov and the team too. But this is the merit of Zharov and Roskomnadzor. Google and Facebook work, although there has long been a law on the transfer of services to Russia. Internet is available. Without Zharov, it would have been worse. I highly appreciate his services to the Runet. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You wrote something similar about Yandex. Say, Yandex also plays the game ...</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
San Sanych is very smart, really. And cunning. But his mind and cunning are bureaucratic and everyday.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yandex has a different plan - business. And bureaucratic tricks are different from business ones like heaven and earth. In one case, people want to work for their own business at the lowest cost, in which many people are involved, and the public good. In another case, people cover their own asshole. This is what we have on the scales, although it looks, perhaps, the same - a trick here and there. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In Russia, the Roskomnadzor periodically Facebook with Twitter </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fined</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , that the FTS by OOO "Google" </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">block</font></font></a>.     (  )     ?           ?             ,     ?</b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's start from the end. I believe that users have already lost once and for all. Because no one had previously bothered about their data, and if you missed it once, you won’t take it back. No, theoretically, you can probably oblige Facebook to erase everything that it knows about us every day. Or take the last case with Yandex, which, at the request of the state, issued data on Golunov’s trips. They could not give out according to the law. But they could depersonalize them, so for the requesting party they would become meaningless. And store only a week, and then turn into an undecodable "brick". However, this will hurt their business, because taxis are built not only and not so much on drivers as on the very big data that the company receives from trips. Therefore, the user has already lost.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What should the state do? First of all, it should provide conditions for competition. Because monopolistic players dictate their own rules of conduct. Facebook can erase your account, and the courts will not help you, because you signed an agreement in which such an option is probably written somewhere in small print. And you did not read it. And it is not up to the state to dictate use agreements. The task of the state is to create such a competitive environment so that no company can afford to do to its users what they do not like. Otherwise, the competitor will immediately intercept and win. In general, the market should decide everything. And to create a market is the task of the state. Maybe even interstate relations: for example, care that Google does not devour Yandex. This does not mean that you need to pour money into Yandex,so that he always kept afloat. It is necessary to create conditions for its development.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let me remind you that in Russia Yandex was always in super-competitive conditions and beat Google. And he continues to do this now to some extent. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the USA, by the way, the market is not created at all. Facebook is a monopoly. Twitter is also a monopoly. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What should companies do? They do not have to do anything. Capitalists should strive for maximum profit; they have such a task. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- But what about the social responsibility of business?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
I don’t believe in it, to be honest. The social responsibility of business begins where the business does not want to conflict with the state and prefers to pay off it. If you do not limit the business, he will spit on social responsibility. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I believe in competition. It should alone make companies socially responsible.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“If Yandex provided Golunov’s data, all other companies, in theory, could say: tomorrow we will anonymize the data, you can ride our taxi. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But they won’t do it because they’re afraid of the state. ”</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Each company is pleased to build an audience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If this is possible by ensuring user privacy, why not. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who owns this data? </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The data belongs to users, judging by the name - personal data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But we allow someone else to use them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It’s just that every time you have to agree on what conditions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another thing is that we do not agree looking, because we have no other choice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I can’t come to Facebook lawyers and say: let's make a couple of changes, and then I will sign the agreement. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Maybe this is the question of social responsibility?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The business is still a different task - to make money. Well, there is no big request from society for this. The only ones dealing with such topics are human rights organizations like Roskomsvoboda. I have not seen millions of demonstrations "We do not want to give your data to Facebook." It’s true that Facebook’s audience is scattered all over the world, but nonetheless. The interests of users are protected by NGOs, which are unlikely to receive much gratitude for this. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why don't users have a request?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Because there is no understanding. 90% do not even think about such things. I understand them in a way: the danger here is very abstract. Well, they’ll send me an advertisement, and then what? And some will even say that it’s right to transfer data to the state: you never know what crimes it will save.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Talking about personal data. Why is Europe accepting GDPR and Russia is </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">going</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the opposite direction?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
I am not a big supporter of GDPR. It seems to me that it rather limits the freedom of business and users than the latter brings any benefits. I think this is a good attempt to protect human rights, but, as is often the case in practice, it is not very effective and formal. Ineffective because the danger of leakage is still here. That is, in general, not much has changed. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
I warmly welcome segmentation. What's bad about it? This is the choice of people. And this is nothing new, by the way. Previously, it was even worse - with the centralization of the media there was no choice.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, people often do not want to receive alternative information. There are also parties of environmentalists about which we do not know their political orientation. It turns out that people without a pronounced political agenda can influence politics. They add variety to their drop. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, but a person closes on himself ...</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
People create comfortable conditions for themselves. For a politician, you probably need to imagine what kind of electorate you have. The electorate itself doesn’t care what is outside of his world. This is a great achievement of our time - the ability to create psychological comfort for ourselves. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How to agree in the conditions of such a separation? For example, to vote in elections?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are mechanisms for this. The bubble is self-defense. If you do not want information to penetrate you, it will not penetrate. But you can open the valve if you need it. There are things that concern everyone, such as the weather. Here you need to negotiate. But we didn’t fenced off on them. On issues that are not of concern to everyone, a person, it turns out, does not want to negotiate. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- “Yandex.Auto,” in your opinion, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">will kill</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> FM broadcasting. It will kill, not displace. You did not write in detail why. Can you tell our audience?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
I used the name as a common name, because Yandex.Avto alone is not capable of killing a seedy radio station - this is a poor development. Service, of course, is progressing, but so far not enough.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Such technologies enable users to listen to anything. Radio does not provide such freedom. In addition, all the resources that distribute their resources through these services (for example, Medusa are podcasts) become radio stations rivals. And the latter may lose. But it's good. Competition is good. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do not be afraid that robots will work for journalists - both textually and visually, and in voice, incl. imitating discussion and jokes in the course of speech? :)</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Yes, he can now. We have one time, "Alice" participated in my broadcasts. Robots can read news, weather forecasts.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“This is not terrible from the point of view that journalists will be out of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is scary because it is easier to filter the information given to people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, Alice will only tell news from Yandex.News. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it turns out that you are not creating your own world, but she is creating her own world to you. ”</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Robot is good at replacing technical things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The robot is good at compilation, including music (music is also a compilation, in fact). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don’t know if he can make brilliant works, but nonetheless. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Radio gives unpredictability. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Listeners are interested in what they say next. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the robot learns unpredictability, then I'm afraid we have a problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I think he will not learn soon, because he is just programmed to be predictable.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, you can play on the verge of these things. Yandex.Music is an example of predictable unpredictability. You can choose what you like, and the service will pop up similar tunes. Play it all in a row (classics, ethnic songs) - few will take it. Or here every week a large audience listens to Shenderovich. Despite the fact that in general she knows what he will talk about. But every time he makes a new pitch. And the robot playing on this balance (predictable-unpredictable, old-new) will not be created for a long time. I think it’s difficult to reproduce Shenderovich (writer Viktor Shenderovich is one of the most popular regular guests of “Echo of Moscow” - approx. Ed.). Although here are the leading “Let's get married”, maybe it’s possible :)</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Even if they reproduce it, maybe this will not be a problem either?” </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People will reach a new level of development ...</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Maybe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, when I first heard Alice, I tensed up a bit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the radio, you have to wait for what they say next. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And “Alice” gives out everything you want, and not much worse. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is impressive. </font></font><br>
