<br>

<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Kyoto University mechatronics team has achieved special results in this area: he won the Japanese student championship in 2019 and reached the quarter-finals of ABU Robocon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth noting that in the model created by students, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop is used as the “brain”, which analyzes the data collected using sensors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We met some members of the circle and discussed its history, participation in competitions and the experience of using ThinkPad laptops.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did the mechatronics circle appear? </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The circle was organized in 1995 to participate in the Japan Student Robocon championships. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, due to the low popularity and limited budget, students visited only three competitions: in 2001, 2003 and 2005. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then they drew attention to other robotics tournaments and achieved good results:</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Finding an equipped workshop for such a hobby is not easy, so the circle has become just a platform uniting those interested in robots, circuitry, programming and mechanical engineering,” said Ryohei Morita, a student at Kyoto University and one of the members of the circle. - We are gathering in one place and by common efforts we find funds for financing, but in fact, everyone is busy with their own project. We do not always tell each other what we are working on. In total there are about 40 participants in the circle, most of whom study at the Faculty of Engineering, but there are exceptions - for example, pharmacists. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Our club is just a platform for people who are interested in robotics, and that’s why it was able to achieve this level of autonomy,” commented Professor Fumitoshi Matsuno. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mr. Matsuno is the head of the Mechatronics Laboratory at Kyoto University, where intelligent devices are being developed at the intersection of mechanics, electrical engineering and control systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He also acts as an adviser to the circle, helps to ensure funding for participation in competitions and deals with administrative matters.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"What if?.."</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“We got together to watch the live broadcast of Robocon 2018, and I suddenly wanted to participate. I expressed this idea for fun, and all of a sudden burst into flames, although we didn’t have enough people or money, ”recalls Morita. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Given the limited budget, students decided to enlist the financial support of former club members and gradually gathered the backbone of the future team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Among us were those who understand both hardware and software. By the time the official rules of the tournament were announced, we were able to assemble a team of 10 people, ”said the young man.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The guys' participation in Robocon - 2019 began with the random phrase “What if? ..”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And although the students encountered certain difficulties, they were able to create a full-fledged robot and put it to the competition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The theme of the tournament was designated as “Great Uertu”, which was inspired by the Mongolian equestrian post system. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Teams used two robots instead of mail horses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They had to go through all the obstacles and bring the "herege" (pass) to the finish line as quickly as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the process, they also had to throw a “walk” (dice), and the robot had no right to complete the route until the desired result was obtained. </font></font><br>

<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Robot brain</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Our robot emits infrared radiation in all directions and analyzes the received signals in order to calculate the distance to the nearest obstacles and go around them on their own. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were other robots with a similar system at the tournament, but we only guessed to use the laptop as the “brain” of the device, ”said Kotaro Matsuoka, a student at Kyoto University and a member of the circle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Other teams used small-sized PCs, for example, Raspberry Pi, but with a laptop you have a full screen and keyboard that help solve any problems on the fly.”</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I can’t even believe it</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Compared with other teams, the mechatronics team at Kyoto University looked weaker. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And during the qualifying rounds, and at the stages of the tournament itself, it was obvious that events did not develop at all as they were presented. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“In the test races, some teams showed results that bypassed ours for 30 seconds or more, and their robots were undoubtedly better,” Matsuoka notes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- First, we put up with the fact that we were not lucky. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in the end, each team revealed its own problems, and it was we who managed to win. ” </font></font><br>

<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Time to update</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After winning the 2019 tournament, the team began preparing for the ABU Robocon competitions and faced a serious problem - insufficient computing power of the system. In order to circumvent obstacles in a timely manner, they must be "seen" in real time, and this process requires an enormous amount of computation. Therefore, the guys had to say goodbye to their old ThinkPad laptop and adopt the modern ThinkPad X1 Carbon.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“As soon as we replaced the laptop, all software problems instantly disappeared,” said Yuki Takezawa, a member of the circle, with a smile. - As for the hardware, we managed to improve the result by about 35 seconds. This allowed qualifying rounds to pass, but not the finals. However, the competitions were attended by much more technological robots, so I am pleased with the results. " </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The robot “sees” its surroundings using sensors that evaluate the location and distance to obstacles based on reflected infrared rays.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The guys took 8th place among 17 participating teams and received an award for the best design. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“In this tournament, robots had to raise and roll the dice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The judges were impressed that our robot was the only one who performed both actions using the same mechanism, ”Matsuoka notes. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gh/zd/_n/ghzd_nfcjmhy5wfyhucxjjnnims.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The original solution, using the same mechanism for grabbing and throwing “walking”, helped the team get an award for the best design of the robot.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“We chose the ThinkPad X1 Carbon for many reasons, but the main thing was support for the 8th generation Intel Core - a modern processor capable of processing large amounts of data with great speed,” Takesawa said. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“After a series of experiments with a relatively new laptop taken from one of the participants, we evaluated the results and realized the importance of this criterion.”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Matsuoka noted that the laptop must be able to withstand vibration, shaking and shock from collisions to which it is exposed during the movement of the robot, so strength and reliability were another important factor. In addition, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is notable for its light weight, classic rectangular case design and a good margin of autonomy - all this simplifies the installation process and further use in the construction of the robot. A large number of ports helps improve system performance by connecting additional devices and sensors. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lenovo laptop, mounted on one of the surfaces of the robot, helps to process sensor data right in the process of moving.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“In short, everything turned out exactly as I expected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We still have an impressive margin of power and had additional opportunities thanks to the software. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just in case, we took another PC with us, but we simply did not need it, because the ThinkPad X1 Carbon handled the loads and passed all the tests, ”Matsumoto sums up. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We at Lenovo believe in an “intelligent transformation” process that helps connect the present with the future and its advanced technologies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Robots created in the mechatronics group of Kyoto University are a great example, because they are created using modern, but quite traditional technological solutions.</font></font></div>
