      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/492164/"><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the theater begins with a hanger, then the city begins with the airport. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, it is at the airport that you get your first impressions of a country, city or region. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, I want to return to some airports again and again, and when I think about others, I shiver. </font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The evolution of airports has gone from a hangar to a huge complex of buildings and structures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Given the needs of passengers, the airport is growing, incorporating many functions.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One after another, the so-called aerotropolis appears. These are not just elements of the transport infrastructure, but fundamentally new forms of public space, into which all functional zones are harmoniously integrated. The modern airport is the most futuristic genre of architecture that anticipates its future development. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first on this list was Hong Kong, where even Disneyland was built near the airport. Then - Shanghai and Singapore. Dubai International Airport is also an example of how one of the main centers in the expanding global airline system has grown into a busy business center around the clock.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Imagine how convenient it is for those who fly to these cities on business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They don’t need to spend a lot of time getting somewhere in traffic jams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They can solve all issues without going outside the aerotropolis. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to the forecast of John Casard - the same professor from the University of North Carolina who coined the word “aerotropolis” - aviation will become the engine of economic development in the 21st century, just as it became a car in the 20th. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, it is entirely possible that aerotropolis is the next stage in the development of cities in general.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5th transport revolution</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Airports have become the fifth wave of changes in transport infrastructure. The first were seaports, the second - rivers and canals. The third wave is railways, the fourth is expressways. Over the past three centuries, all major cities began their history at the intersection of transport routes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today, business parks, logistics and industrial complexes, industrial areas, shopping centers, technological, information and communication structures appear near the largest airports around the world. The areas allocated for these facilities are steadily increasing in proportion to passenger traffic.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The comfort of the airport itself is also increasing. For example, at Singapore's Changi International Airport, passengers can swim in the pool, go to the movies, or take a walk in the flowering garden. And in the South Korean “Incheon”, in any weather and at any time of the year, there is an ice rink with artificial ice. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Working to improve the quality of passenger service, airports strive to ensure that the need for a flight is not associated with stress, but with a pleasant pastime. For example, they are starting to abandon annoying voice alerts over the loudspeaker, which many passengers are worried about.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The concept of a “quiet airport” has already been implemented by the airports of Helsinki, Munich, the city airport of London, and the air hub in Mumbai. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All information there is displayed on bulletin boards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We also went to Domodedovo to reduce noise: only the most important messages are voiced here.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Airport as a business</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The construction of most airport complexes is carried out on the basis of public-private partnerships - this is a mechanism for attracting private investors by the state to solve socially significant problems on mutually beneficial conditions. The first successful PPP in Russia was the reconstruction of Pulkovo Airport. The agreement came into force ten years ago. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2019, the management company of Pulkovo Airport “Air Gate of the Northern Capital” completed the first stage of modernization of the commercial zone of the internal departure hall. It provides for the location of more than 50 stores and 25 food service outlets, including a Duty Paid format store, through which passengers are sent from the inspection area to the boarding gates. The total area of ​​the new Duty Paid was about 1 thousand square meters.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The growth of non-aviation income is one of the most important trends reflecting the development of modern airports. To increase them, air hubs are positioned as a multifunctional business, providing their territories for the development of services and entertainment. The main factors for making a profit are retail trade (mainly duty-free), car parks, food and beverage sales, advertising, real estate and services. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At some airports, for example, countries of Southeast Asia, the share of non-aviation revenues reaches 60%. In Russia, this figure does not exceed 20-25%. This is largely due to the fact that in our country for a long time receiving non-aviation income was not given due importance. And about 70% of the airport complexes we built more than 20 years ago.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
New airports began to appear in the Russian Federation since 2010: as a rule, they are being built for large events like the Olympics or the World Cup. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Often - on the site of the old model airport buildings that were erected throughout the Union in the 1960s.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The reconstruction of the existing infrastructure, unfortunately, does not always allow achieving the desired result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Investing in new buildings and structures that are initially focused on modern passenger service standards and allow you to allocate a sufficient number of areas for commercial activities is much more profitable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The required number of commercial areas provided in the designed terminal, which are leased for various businesses and bring profit to investors, allows the airport to receive higher incomes without increasing the base cost of transportation.</font></font></div>
