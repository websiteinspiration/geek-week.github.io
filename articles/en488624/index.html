It's about helping one employee to another in solving problems. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is impossible to say that we are not helping each other. But this practically does not affect efficiency. We help to solve the problem in principle. Well, then, when the solution to the problem is at stake. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, a man sits and dulls. An hour, two, a day, a week. Periodically switches to other tasks, suffers, suffers, but dulls further. Then he doesn‚Äôt stand it, asks someone, he gets either a tip, a direction of movement, or a decision.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For factory programmers - the approach is absolutely correct. There, the time spent on solving the problem does not matter. Only tasks like ‚Äúaaaa server fell‚Äù or ‚Äúhell, income tax is not considered, take it in an hour!‚Äù require and, most importantly, receive immediate response from the entire IT department. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, unfortunately, we have a business that earns according to the banal formula: income minus expense. Like any other business. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Income - how much the client will pay for solving the problem. Consumption - how much we will spend on solving the problem.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, then everything is simple. The longer a person sits with a task, the higher the expense. Accordingly, the longer an employee stupid, the less the company will earn. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Someone will say garbage. If the task is for the client 4 hours, then the employee will receive 4 hours, but he‚Äôs stupid for at least a week. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there is such a thing in the world as lost profits. I quote: unrealized opportunities for generating income, profits in connection with the unsuccessful choice of image, method of action. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Simply put, a person could make 40 paid hours per week, but he did 4. Because he was dumb over the task without receiving timely help. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Actually, the word ‚Äútimely‚Äù is the key. Because help has different goals. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have already mentioned the first goal - to help, so that the task is generally solved. With such a goal, it is perfectly acceptable to let down.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second goal is not to help at all, let him figure it out, maybe he can learn something. With such a goal, helping is harmful. True, it‚Äôs hard to earn money. Especially if the employee studies, studies, and then dumps. He didn‚Äôt bring money, he learned to work, and will help a new employer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The third goal is to help solve the problem faster. The faster the problem was solved, the more money we earned. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are two points, or points of growth. The first is conversion. The less time an employee spent on solving a problem, the more we earned. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second is the deadline. If the dull one is helped in a timely manner, then he will solve the problem quickly, and the client will get the result faster. Well, or, at least on the agreed date. If the dull one is not helped, then he will advance the task for a week, a month, or even longer.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The speed of solving the problem is important to the client, but does not give a direct instant effect. However, it is possible that the client will like it if his tasks are solved quickly. And he will increase their number. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some customers have a single task rule. It is not advertised, but is meant. I, too, once was a customer, imagine, and what it is about. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The rule is simple: give one problem, and do not give a second until the first is solved. Tasks are arranged in a chain, a queue, like red blood cells in capillaries, and crawl through only one at a time. Accordingly, the faster one task is solved, the faster the second will appear in the work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Actually, further it is clear. Help is a tool to achieve a specific goal. Depending on the purpose, assistance must either not be provided at all, or provided just before the deadline, or provided in a timely manner. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You don‚Äôt have it at all - the employee is either growing or drowning. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You find yourself in the deadline - the employee is growing poorly, earnings are low, the deadlines for solving problems are high. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You render in a timely manner - we earn more money, the deadlines for solving problems are short, the client is satisfied and brings us the rest of the money. True, there is a suspicion that employees do not grow if they are constantly helped. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But this is not so. Here the key is the cause of dullness, which requires help. On what shut up, went in cycles. The most common is context.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Typically, an employee is dumb on context. He does not understand where to start. He doesn‚Äôt know what is surrounded by the problem in general, whether it be a framework or a subject area. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Roughly speaking, he is looking for something, I do not know what. It seems, well, figs with him, he will find, after all, in the end. And remember. Will remember </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But not a fig. I also used to think that once finding a solution, I will not forget it. I‚Äôll forget how. Moreover, very quickly. And the value that I found it myself is zero. And for the company - it‚Äôs quite specific money that it didn‚Äôt receive while I was stupid. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And you need something quite a bit. In fact, poke your finger in the direction of solving the problem. Check this out. Look over there. Try it through this mechanism. You are not looking at all there. Etc.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The key is timeliness. It makes no sense to wait until a person loads a context into his head, understands all the relationships to solve the problem and immediately forget the whole context. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there are difficulties with the help. First - what for it helps? After all, helping another, you lose your time. Your own effectiveness is decreasing, but at the recipient of aid it is increasing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I don‚Äôt know, to be honest, what to do. That is, I know several options related to changes in the motivation system, but this area is often beyond reach. But in vain. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I know one thing: the total effectiveness of the team, while providing timely assistance, is growing, and very significantly. The one who has helped has lost a little, the tupeyev has gained - more than the one who has helped lost. As a result, the team earned more.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
True, the concept of "team" is not common, so it cuts the ear. What kind of team? There is me, there is he, she, they, bosses, managers, clients. Who is the team here? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Again, I don‚Äôt know. I only know that the team does and gives more than the team. 10 people, each of whom works for himself, is a team. Add a boss to them - you get a department. We remove the boss, organize mutual assistance and set a common goal - we get a team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A team will bring more money than a team and a department. Yes, and earn more in the end. And competencies will grow faster thanks to the constant exchange of knowledge. The one who helps is also enriched with knowledge. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second difficulty is purely algorithmic. For example, I was dumb and I need help. But the one who could help is objectively busy. What to do?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The wrong option is to go further into one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">lose a ton of time waiting for help. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The correct option is to do another task, clearly indicating that you need help. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the help is freed, you must be ready to switch immediately, so as not to waste his time waiting. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is a compromise option that increases conversion - the deadline for solving the problem, it seems, remains the same. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the ratio of the sold result to the spent hours is growing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to own research, 2-3 times.</font></font></div>
