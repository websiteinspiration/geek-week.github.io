He worked on Clojure alone for about 2.5 years before showing it to anyone.</font></font></i><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This is just a report based on experience. Not a scientific report, there will be no methodology, science, or anything else. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When was the last time you seriously thought about something for an entire hour? So that no one bothers you and you can concentrate. Or a whole day? Do you remember the day when you could think about something all day? Or a month? Thinking about something almost all the time? Or a year?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These are extremely valuable points, if you have any. I think I was very lucky, I could think of three different things for a year or more. One of them was Clojure. And there is nothing that I value more than such a time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another thing I would like to ask is: “When was the last time you felt confident trying to do something that you had never done before?” And what do you think it takes to be sure of what you have never done before? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Obviously, as software developers, we often make another application that extracts something from the database and places it on the Internet, but the more successful you are, the greater the likelihood that you will encounter problems that you have never solved before. And how do you begin to solve them? Not feeling in great danger?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, I will start by telling you about some things in the field of software development that we all know are true.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We hate errors in our programs. We are trying to write quality programs. And we know that if we allow programs to enter the market, it is incredibly expensive to fix inconsistencies and program errors. Therefore, we say that we will have a serious testing process in the testing department. And even in this case, as we know, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
everything is not so wonderful, because the solution to the problem occurs at a distance, at a distance from the development, which is not good. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So now we know what to do in this area. We fix bugs while writing </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
code, testing in development, and this is the best way to avoid bugs in our applications, right? </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Audience: None.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Did you notice that I learned to display each element in turn? So now you do not know what I'm going to say next. It is excellent. No, definitely definitely not. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The least expensive place to fix bugs when you design your software. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What is everyone doing, huh? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yeah. I will argue that everything I say here is very, very vague, but, without a doubt, most of the important problems that we face in programs are problems of misunderstanding. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We do not have a good idea of ​​what we are doing before we do it. And then, faster, faster, faster, and we grab onto everything. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have methodologies, and we feel really good after that.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But if you ruin everything, as Mark McGranaghan said at the very beginning, nothing good will come of it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They are not implementation issues. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Obviously there are problems with the implementation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And testing and other things help with that. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the problems of misunderstanding are usually not solved by testing, or type systems, or things that we use to fix defects in the implementation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actually, there are no type systems that could tell us that we are on the right track, or </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
what we are doing is going in the right direction.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Analysis and Design</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I'm going to talk a little bit about analysis and design. I know that it is so outdated, and terribly, and rightly was criticized, and really thrown away. Because people believed that this was due to the process, drawing pictures, knowing everything about everything and drawing up comprehensive plans for the Waterfall model, and there was a lot of terrible things about it. But this does not mean that the step before “go and do it” is not an important step. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think that we do not spend enough time and effort, do not devote enough time to this. This is not always our fault. We can say: oh, we would like to spend time thinking about it, but we have to give out something next week. But quality definitely suffers because we do not waste time planning.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I would like to define what you think about, what analysis and design are, I would like you to forget about it for a moment and let's try to give a really </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
simple definition. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Analysis and design are two things: </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">identifying the</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> problem that we are trying to solve, and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">evaluating</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> our proposed solution in terms of whether it solves this problem or not. It really is what these things are, not something else. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We must solve problems. We should not cut features. Solve the problem! There is nothing about features ... What is a feature? A feature is just an attribute of something. This is a shiny chrome handle on something. This is not the purpose of the machine.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is no guarantee if you make a list of features, even if it is received from the client, that he will solve their own problem, or that he will solve any problem, or that the features, when you combine them, will not create a ton of other problems. Thus, programming and writing code does not boil down to a list of features. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In particular, features offered by users, despite all their efforts to satisfy themselves, are often not good ideas. You have to get to the bottom of the matter and find out what their problem is, and how best to solve it, and then reconcile it with what they ask.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We also have a tendency, because we are all smart, and we like being smart and sort of figuring out how to get things to work, that understanding how to get things to work is good, no matter what you need to do this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we can find a way around the problem, we say: “Wow! It's great". </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But this is not great. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Avoiding the problems that we can solve is very capable - not the same as solving them. Therefore, we must really try to solve the problems. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today I’m going to talk about the fact that there are actually a bunch of methods and skills for solving problems, and the first thing is just to try to understand the problem you are working on, recognize, identify it, put it somewhere and talk about it. So problem solving is definitely a skill.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think that you should not leave this speech with the thought that there are certain people who are good at solving problems, and only they do this part of the work, and we have to practice other things. You can practice problem solving.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/783/84e/b8e/78384eb8e7f4f078b63fcdcc37ad1d64.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Poia wrote this amazing book entitled "How to Solve a Problem" in 1945, about how to practice in practice, and what are the methods for solving mathematical problems in this case. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is an amazing book, full of deep understanding. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And if you have never read it, immediately after my talk go to Amazon and order yourself a copy. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the things that is not so good in this book is that it is in mathematical space. There is a really good thing in this space. When you have solved the problem, and you think that you have an answer, you have all the methods of mathematical proof to determine if you really have an answer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Software developers do not have this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It’s impossible to prove that you have a good solution to someone’s problem with an e-commerce site. There are no mathematical methods, and will not be in the near future, allowing us to prove this. But this is a skill, and this is what you can practice, what you can learn. And this is worth doing, because as humans we are good at what we practice. It doesn't matter what it is. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are amazing examples of people practicing things that they seem </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
to have no hope of becoming good, but they become good at them because they were practicing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you practice problem solving, really practice problem solving, you will succeed. If you practice the X methodology, you will be good at it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I would like you to ask yourself: "What is the best way to achieve the goal?" </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I don't care what X is. Choose any X you want. Would you rather be good at it? Or be middle peasants in solving problems? So what do we need to do? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we are going to work on problem solving, what is our activity like? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first thing to say: “I am solving this problem. This problem is as follows. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and therefore blah." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have seen so much software designed so that no one has ever said this. No one ever recorded this. And then we have a whole system, and no one said what problem it should solve.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we do not solve the problem, I have no idea why we are in this room. We must work on solving problems, which means that we must number them. And then from the mental position, which I will talk about later, it’s really important to say the problems out loud. From the perspective of a person who is trying to solve a problem. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Talk to someone in your group and say, “We have to solve this. The problem is blah, blah, blah. " Say, or speak, or write it down. Just like when you use the practice of repeating someone’s name, when you are introduced to someone to remember the name. It is the same. This is the source of the solution to the problem, its statement.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next part, which is definitely harder, and Polly’s book is great at that. It has a lot of practical things. Many of them coincide with what he said - to understand the problem. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We say: “We have this problem. I think we need a NoSQL database. " Something is missing, right? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“We have this problem. We need a NoSQL database. ” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We actually did not say “why.” What are the characteristics of this problem that lead us to this solution space? I think this is the whole interesting part in the development of software. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, the first step: what do you know about what you are trying to do?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There will definitely be a bunch of facts. There will be customer requirements. There will be other things. There will be a context: the system should work on such devices, should work with such a duration. more than so many watts, or should support 10 million users. Whatever it is. The requirements of such a plan and such restrictions. All of these conditions are facts that you need to consider. There will be things about which you immediately know that you do not know them. “I wonder where we will take the data as input for this system?” Or: “What will we do when our primary data source is unavailable? Do we have a spare source? ” There will be such questions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, there will be things about which you do not know that you do not know them. But if there are things that you do not know about, you should think about them now.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another thing that needs to be done is to say, you know, everybody says, “Oh, do X. I have a great idea for X.” As if you are the only person in the world who has ever solved this problem. This is very, very unlikely, so find ready-made solutions to such problems. Are there others you know about? What can you learn about them? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Because the search for ready-made solutions to the same problem is the best way to quickly gain speed and start working on the most famous solutions in this area. Because what you need to do will be one step ahead of what the last guy did. But if you ignore what the last guy did, you start from scratch, so you definitely want to look around in space.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I do not advocate any methodology or anything like that, but if you want to do this work, you have to write it down somehow. I don’t care how. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another thing you have to do: you have to be picky. You must be critical. In the software world, we all need to be that way, because there are all these things from the community.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's like, I just heard "wonderful." I would like it to be “wonderful”. I just hear it 50 times a day. Not all offers are great. It's hard to talk about other people's decisions that aren't great. So basically focus on your own problems. In particular, when you find solutions, when you try to find a solution to a problem, look for defects in your own solution. And, of course, you could talk about it, because there will be technical errors. Errors in the logic will be. There will also be flavoring and personal opinions, problems of abstractions and the like. All this is connected together, enough for a separate conversation. But no matter what problems you find in your own solutions, try to solve them too, right away, in advance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So the other thing you see:</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"Oh, we're going to do it." </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"Oh, we use the NoSQL database." </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"It's great. She has these 10 attributes. This is amazing". </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is really easy to be delighted with the good aspects of what you are doing, but you must pay attention to compromises. The chances of a lack of compromise in any decision are slim. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another thing is, "what do you not know?" If there are things about which you know </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
that you do not know them, then you need to have questions that you must ask in order to find out what you do not know. You cannot know everything, therefore such things should be marked with questions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Whatever you have to work with, write down all these things. There should </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
be question marks </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on this page </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. If there are no question marks, skip this step.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another thing you should think about: none of us were born knowing how to write programs. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
None of us were born, knowing about SQL, about the Internet, protocols, or anything else. And if you are trying to solve a problem, especially in a space in which you have not yet solved it, you will have a very limited opportunity to find a solution if you have little information. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You will need to get many different inputs so that you can let your brain rotate between them and say, “Oh, yes. This idea and this idea are related to each other, and therefore, I can do this other thing. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you take only a very narrow excerpt, “I see for sure what I'm doing now, right now, to come up with a decision next week”, you will not have enough information to make decisions. So, you need to read about the space in which you are in, many, very specific things to read. Wow, there are other people trying to do the same; and then overall, there are these other characteristic problems; and maybe even if you want, try to find research papers that are in the same space.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's amazing that cool things can be found if you look for something like ACM (Association of Computing Engineering) documents: “Oh, I wonder if we can get a certain type of hash code, you go to Google and enter a“ hash code that does something. " Press Enter. And if there are some scientific and ACM links, take these documents. Even if you only understand the tiny part of the article, it will probably contribute to your ability to think about your problem.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another thing: even if you are not going to argue with the author of the idea out loud, when you look at his solution, be extremely critical. I can’t tell you how often you will find a new best idea by completely crucifying the idea of ​​the last guy. At least in your own head. Disassemble it into parts, because when you disassemble it, you will find a couple of things that maybe they did not write down when they solved it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone says design is a compromise. Everyone knows that. Usually, when they talk about compromises in their software, they talk about parts of their </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
software that are crap. I had to take these compromises into account. This is not what a compromise is, right?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You should consider at least two solutions to your problem. At least two. And you must find out what is good and what is bad in these things before you can say: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"I have found a compromise." Therefore, I highly recommend you do this. And when you do this, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
you can record it somewhere. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Okay. So, let's talk a little more about practice. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most of the attempts to do this work is to concentrate. Yesterday we had a really good conversation about the state of the flow, and this is a kind of concept </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
related to concentration. And when you try to design something, you will need the strongest concentration of attention than ever. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And so there are some interesting points about the hammock.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the interesting points is that you can lie in a hammock and close your eyes, and no one knows that you are NOT sleeping, but they will not bother you because they will think that you are sleeping. So this is very cool. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Computers are bad, bad sources of distraction. They are very bad, especially for people like us. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seems like something else besides what I'm trying to think about. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You desperately need to run away from the computer if you are trying to concentrate. It is almost impossible to concentrate while sitting at the computer.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another thing about concentration is that you have to compromise when you try to concentrate very intensely. You will drop the balls (juggling balls). You will forget to call back and answer emails, as well as make your slides for conferences, until you arrive at the airport. These are the rules. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the only thing you should report about this process to people who are not indifferent to you. The fact is that when you are immersed in the process, you will seem pretty far away. And this is not connected with the person who is dear to you. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It’s just the nature of this kind of work, so it’s important to let them know. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many people will not have time to do this every day or for a whole week, but if you are going to concentrate, determine what form it will be.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone knows about the time-out method for young children (temporary separation of the child from the environment). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, programmers need this method. Therefore, as young children, they need to </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
sit in a hammock so that no one bothers them. So I think that the process includes </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
two parts of your mind and this is what you observe. There are books written about it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have not read them, but they seem to be consistent with my personal experience, which is that you have an awake mind and background mind. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And your waking mind is really good at criticism. He analyzes very well and very, very good tactics. We need to make a decision right now.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The lion is chasing after us. Jump to the left. We are really good at that. This is what our waking mind consists of: keeping us alive and making short-term decisions, looking at the information immediately provided and doing something with it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, if you think that you are going to sit down and look at the problem for the first time, and stare at your computer, and do something, and talk for 10 minutes, and make a really good decision. I do not think so. I know I can’t do this. Definitely not.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The problem with these things is that they push you up. “Oh, I see it. Oh, I see it. Oh, I see ... well, here I have a choice left or right. OK, I can go right. A little up. Left or right, right. Now to the left. Up. Still up. This part of your mind is really good at finding a local maximum, but it is not very good at getting off the track where it is and discovering the fact that there is another hill that really lifts you higher. But I think that there is a very, very important occupation that you must do if you want to use your whole brain and become very good at solving problems. In other words, to think about using your waking time to assign tasks to your background mind,really seriously think about something and create a job for your background mind. This is the meaning of the hammock, and this whole list, and all this work that we are going to talk about when you are awake, in fact, is to give the other half of you an activity.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another good thing in your waking mind: when you think you have a great idea that you came up with in the background mind, your waking mind </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
takes it apart well, saying, “Ah. You thought you woke up with this brilliant idea, but now I see this feature that does not seem so brilliant. ” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So let's talk about the background mind. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am not going to directly equate it with a sleeping mind, but a sleeping mind is the first example of a background mind. You can access your background mind during the day when you are awake, but it is difficult. He is good at making connections. Things like, “If I make a hut out of mud and it rains heavily, it will fall apart” is not necessarily the thing that </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
you can tactically figure out.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Your background mind will know the aspects of all these various components, make connections and synthesize them. Even if you think that you really know how to make decisions on the fly, you almost always just return something that your background mind already understood. So the background mind is good at synthesizing things. He is good at strategy. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And so when Mark talks about abstractions and things like that, abstractions are a software strategy. Since the idea is that you are making some kind of super global decision, which must be correct in a number of contexts in which you still cannot make tactical decisions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What does it mean to create an abstraction from which you are going to create libraries?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What does it mean to put something into a programming language when I have no idea what you guys are going to do about it? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is a more strategic thing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You do not create programming languages ​​and do not say: “How will this programming language </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
handle HTTP requests?” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What you want to do is give Mark something he can use when he has a tactical solution for HTTP requests. And this is strategic thinking, and your background mind is good at strategic thinking. If you want to create an abstraction, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
you must take the time to do this thinking, because this is the part of your brain from which it comes. This part creates an abstraction. She draws an analogy. I think that it is here that you solve most of the non-trivial tasks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes you can make the right decisions on the fly, but if you are really trying to solve something difficult, you need to use the other half of your head. So I'm not just saying that. American scientists say that when we sleep, we process information during the day, this is pretty obvious. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sleep strengthens memory, and that’s good. I mean, it's important to remember what you are working on. But more importantly, the dream is well versed in things. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I just advocate getting as much input as possible. A lot of input data, the analysis of requirements in space is carried out, everything that is needed is read, it </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
looks at suitable solutions and is divided into parts. A bunch of things. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When do you decide what is important and what is not? When you are sleeping.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Evolution has solved this problem for us, and this is the solution that it came up with. We cannot ignore it. We must use it. But the most important thing is to find hidden relationships </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
and solve the problems that we worked on. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, imagine someone saying, "I have a problem with this, that, that." And you look at it for 10 minutes and say, “Okay, I'm going to go to the cinema and do something else or something else.” Then you go to sleep. Are you going to solve this problem in a dream? </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Someone from the audience: Of course.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
No. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You didn’t think about this problem? No, you did not think about her. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You did not think of her diligently enough while you were awake so that she became important to</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
your mind while you sleep. And we come back to what your background mind feeds. You really have to work hard: just think about it without writing it down. Just think about the problem during the day, so that it becomes the agenda for your background mind. Here's how it works. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When people somewhere out there say: “My God. How am I going to find food, but I know that I saw an elk there, and it seems to be sometimes near the water. "That's when you wake up as a caveman and say:“ Let's go hunt animals by the water. ”This is not a logical conclusion. It seems that your waking mind is analyzing this, but not necessarily there is logic in it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It really is a process of such parallel thinking. So it is very important.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, we have a problem because we are asked to write software, which over time becomes more and more complicated. And we know that there is a working memory limit of type 7 plus / minus 2. And no matter how smart we are, we all suffer from the same limitation. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the problems that we are called to solve are usually much larger than these numbers. So what do we do? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we cannot fit all this into our heads at the same time, how can we work on a problem with more than nine components? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I will recommend you write down all the information. Especially nowadays.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, you wrote a lot about the problem. You know what the problem is. You know a lot of facts about her. You know the limitations of the runtime. You know what you do not know. You asked yourself these questions. You recorded them. "I would like to know that I knew this." You looked at competitive things and said: “It works great here, but this part of this competitive thing sucks. I hate this. I wish she was not here. ” </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You have put an important agenda in your background mind. And when you try to download a problem, you need to study it, and that was the point in writing it down earlier. If you wrote down all the things, including some sketches of how you want to solve the problem, you can </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
just look back and look at it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And it's kind of how many balls you can juggle at the same time? Well, you can only juggle so many. Well, I can't juggle at all. But if we look at 7 plus / minus 2, we say that we can juggle 7-9 balls. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But if you can imagine that you have an assistant who from time to time can take out one of them and put a ball of a different color, then you can juggle balls of </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
20 different colors at a time, if there are only nine balls in the air at a time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You will be as if looking around at all these pieces and putting arbitrary figures in your head at different points in time. Maybe you will draw pictures. Do not use UML for this. This is not a methodology. So try again and again. But then you need again</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
move away from the computer. There is another very important part, which is to go and sit somewhere, having no more input, close your eyes and not fall asleep. Close your eyes because we have another feature. Everyone knows what it is. It is really hard to describe. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Does everyone have a concept of their own mental gaze? What you see when you close your eyes and start thinking about something. This is strange, I mean, in fact </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
, it is not visually technically, although some people are really visually rich.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I can not describe it, but it is not very realistic. This part is important for your brain, because at that moment you switch from the information input mode. If you just look at your list, you are in the “I receive input” mode. But when you sit and ponder something and hash it in your head, you have no other input, which means that you are training the return. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I looked at these 20 points. Suppose there were only 20. I looked at these 20 points again and again. And I hopped between them. Now I close my eyes and try to return them and think about them a little more in my head, and you will find that if you took the last step, returning the information again and again, you can really sit in a hammock and get </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
all the pieces of a rather big problem out of your heads maybe at the same time</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
and think of them that way. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This exercise is really very important. I don’t know why, it just is, because it speeds up the return, which definitely helps to deal with important points to </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
your background mind. We will call it the “time of mental gaze”. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now you are done. Pie in the oven. You just have to wait. It's so cool. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the things that I would say: at least wait a night. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No matter how, you and your friends talked about it, and you just feel the pressure: "I understand what’s the matter." Sleep with this thought for at least one night. At least one if this is an important decision. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Rich showed the line sober sober for the best results.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How many people woke up this morning to answer a difficult problem? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You see? This is science. Science at work. No, this is really a sad thing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you don’t think about it, it will turn out like this: “What happened? I worked hard all day. ” For example: “I have finished working. Time to relax". </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unfortunately, if you believe what I am saying today, you are actually doing something important when you are sleeping. So sometimes you really need to give your brain a chance to do this other part of the job. If you always deny it, I don’t think you will have better results. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unfortunately, sometimes one night is not enough.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some big problems, especially finding really good abstractions or finding answers to things that satisfy many concurrent limitations, take a lot of time. And there is. And I know everyone should supply features and all that. In this case, much of what I say is not appropriate. And, as I said earlier, I think this is a great opportunity when I have a lot of time to think about a problem, because I know that I will come up with a better solution. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One way you can handle this and not get stuck is: “Okay, let me think about it for 3 months.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Because most managers are not very susceptible to this proposal. Just work on something else, but only another day. Try to work on something</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
one during the day. But if over time you have three projects, it is quite possible to download one and work on it for three days. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And you will find that you cannot find answers to any of your questions and cannot come up with new solutions, you are a little stuck. Just switch to another project and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
work on it for several days. You must amortize the loading time. It may take anything from an hour to a whole day to download, so as soon as you have uploaded the information to yourself, try to think about it for at least the rest of the day,</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
or three days or more. But don't get stuck on a stuck thing. Just switch. Do not get stuck. Switch. Or get more information. Talk about the problem in more detail. Continue to drive the path to a solution. Do not get hung up on her. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then, in the end, the cake comes out of the oven. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You wake up and you have a great idea. You think you know the answer to your problem, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
or you have a good idea for a solution. Unfortunately, sometimes you do not have the answer to the problem you were working on. You worked on three projects and uploaded </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
project C, but you woke up with an answer to project A. That should be fine. Just </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
switch and take advantage of this solution. At least remember it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you wake up with an answer to another problem that you cannot work with on that day, write down the results of this background process. They are really helpful. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Finally, you need to take your great ideas and find out if they are really great, or by analyzing them more, which is certainly important, but sometimes you need to print them on your computer. In fact, we all have to do this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, you must finally write the code. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's funny, Stu has this one - he saw some of my design tables. As he calls them, a “document of despair” or something else, he calls them. It seems we cannot do this. This does not work like that. Question marks, blah, blah. This other thing was like ... One negative. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But these are all challenges in the process of solving problems.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is not despair. This is positive. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It says: "I know what my challenges are, and therefore I can work on them." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You get a solution, now you have something, so you are trying ... </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Trying to print less. I know that I do this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Because if I think I have an answer, and this answer is small, this is one of the most convincing signs that it is probably good. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I hope that after going through this whole process, you will gain confidence after you see that it works. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So you say: “You know what, I have never done this before, but I really thought about it, and this solution that I found overnight seems amazing, and wow! Go!"</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important to look at what you have done, to launch it, to see, to learn something new about the decision and say: “Oh, you know, my guess. It is wrong. I thought it would have such a </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
feature, but it is not and so on. D. " </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I do not defend the cascade model. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Try different approaches and come back. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's good. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But do not rely on them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dentistry through testing, I don’t think I can come up with a better name. So it does not work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Last thought: you will be wrong. I often make mistakes. This is part of the game. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You will think of the best ideas. I think this is one of the most exciting things.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think that no matter what I ever thought about, the fact that I know that I will think about the best solutions, although they will not be ideal, because I know that I brought something that was not the best means that I'm still in the game. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It still works. So you will think about the best ideas. And the facts are changing. They can change for two reasons, right? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Firstly, you missed some of them at the very beginning. They reopen by you </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
because you missed them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What else do we have?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Change requirements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We know that it happens. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Facts will change. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the facts change, do not bury. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Check again and see if your answer is still correct in the context of new requirements, new facts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if this is not so, change the decision and do not apologize. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes you will just make mistakes, mistakes in logic, or just go the wrong way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is normal. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If I could promote anything, then I would say "do not be afraid", especially "do not be afraid to make mistakes." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the end, these were reasonings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There will be no conclusions. </font></font><br>
