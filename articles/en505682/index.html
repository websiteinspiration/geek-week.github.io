This phenomenon remains one of the strangest and least understood consequences of quantum mechanics. If you measure the quantum property of one of a pair of entangled particles, then the property of the other instantly changes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Such strange phenomena usually occur at the subatomic level. But recently, physicists have shown entanglement and other quantum effects in extreme forms, observing them in large systems, including atom clouds, quantum drums, conductors, and silicon chips. Device by device, they transfer the quantum world to a new territory - to the macroscopic world.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These works find new applications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some experimental quantum computers use loops of superconducting conductors as qubits storing quantum information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Large quantum objects have already been used to help detect gravitational waves; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">they may appear on next-generation devices such as hypersensitive sensors and encryption systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These innovations, however, go far beyond advanced technology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The construction of larger and larger quantum objects increases the possibilities of exploring some of the unsolved mysteries at the intersection between the quantum and classical worlds, and between quantum mechanics and gravity.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two worlds</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger first described the dualism of waves and particles 90 years ago (1), physicists have been exploring the boundary between the observable, predictable macroscopic world and the world in which probability quantum laws operate. In the quantum world, a particle exists as a wave describing the probability of its location. However, after measurement, the particle is localized at a certain point in space. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, a quantum particle can be in a superposition of two quantum states with a certain probability of being in each of them. For example, an electron may be in a superposition of high and low energy levels. When a measurement is made, this state is destroyed, and it is observed that the electron is only at one of the levels. According to quantum mechanics, the act of measurement changes the system.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The same with tangled pairs. Measuring the property of one leads to a change in the property of the other, no matter how far they are. All this contradicts the reliable Newtonian laws that govern our macroscopic world in which an object can be reliably detected in one place. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quantum rules apply to individual atoms and other particles of the microworld, but everything consists of tiny atoms, so it’s clear that these effects must scale. But how far away?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Most people believe that there is no hard line beyond which everything suddenly changes and quantum mechanics ceases to function,” says physicist Simon Greblacher from the University of Delft (Netherlands). “But if we run into a hard limit,” says John Toifel of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Boulder, Colorado), “this will be one of the most exciting finds in this area.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some physicists have suggested such a limit. According to the so-called theories of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">objective collapse of the WF</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The still undiscovered laws of nature explain this riddle without resorting to the idea that observation changes the system. The English mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose suggested that the collapse of the WF is a consequence of gravity; therefore, systems larger than a certain mass should never exhibit quantum behavior (2). Girardi-Rimini-Weber Theory ( </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GRW</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">), published in 1986, states that WF particles can simply spontaneously collapse (3). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a very rare event for an individual particle, but in a large system of billions or more entangled particles, a collapse for one of them will soon lead to a collapse of the others. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Since the collapse is random, you can only guess what a suitable system should be,” says Mika Sillanpää from Lahti University of Technology (Mikkeli, Finland). “It can be a milligram mass or a mass of the Earth.”</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quantum chaos</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Physicists continue to argue about the size at which the microscopic world transforms into the macroscopic one, and how to quantify this change. “This is a difficult question and you will get different answers from different experts,” says physicist Jonathan Friedman of Amherst College, Massachusetts. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite this, experimental physicists demonstrate quantum effects in increasingly complex fields. It is not easy at all. Quantum effects are fleeting, subtle and sensitive, drowned out even by the slightest vibration or thermodynamic fluctuations. To observe them, experimental installations are required that completely isolate the system from the heat and noise of the outside world.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For many years, researchers have been able to successfully reduce this noise by observing individual subatomic particles and even large atoms in entangled states. The selection of quantum effects is not so much a matter of size as of complexity. Observing any system from individual atoms to microscopic drums means suppressing the noise of all moving parts so that quantum effects can enter the scene. The noisiest variable is usually warm: “temperature is one of the causes of noise that will mask some of the effects and signals you are looking for,” says Toyfel. And he continues that many recent demonstrations of large-scale quantum effects are based on the methods used to freeze noise in individual atoms: “we use the same elegant methods, but not for individual atoms,and for quadrillion atoms, to do things that are closer to engineering devices that we can observe and use. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One approach uses a loop of a superconducting wire, typically about a micrometer in diameter, interrupted by compounds of a non-superconducting material. Superconductivity means that electrons flow along the circuit without resistance, and current can be measured in these transitions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Physicists can use magnetic fields to make current flow in both directions around the ring at the same time. This does not mean that half flows in one direction and half in the other; all electrons act as one and simultaneously move clockwise and counterclockwise. In 2000, Friedman was a member of the group that achieved the greatest magnetic flux in superposition. “I think I'm still holding a world record, believe it or not,” he says.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
More recently, physicists have used superconducting loops to create qubits that store quantum information using magnetic flux. When properly tuned, these </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">stream qubits</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> can exhibit amazing quantum effects. In 2016, an international group of physicists used these qubits to exclude theories that predicted the collapse of the WF for specific currents and time scales (4). In particular, quantum laws continued to operate in their qubit at a current of 170 nanoamps for at least 10 nanoseconds. These measurements disprove theories that require that WF collapse occur at these or smaller scales.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mechanical systems are also attractive targets for reproducing quantum phenomena. In Delft, Greblacher achieved entanglement on a scale approaching the macrocosm, using membranes with a diameter of 1 mm, which can vibrate for several minutes after the jolt, which makes them attractive for testing mechanical entanglement. Greblacher proposes to use such a system in the future to place a living organism in a quantum superposition. For this experiment, an extremely small creature like a slow-moving is required. “That would show that even such complex systems can obey the laws of quantum physics,” he says.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
More recently, the Greblacher group conducted experiments on a device consisting of two silicon chips, cooled to almost absolute zero. Each chip has an etched tiny channel with a length of only about 10 micrometers. These channels act as mechanical generators that can convert light into movement. When light falls on them, they expand and contract with an almost perfectly matched frequency. They also translate the movement back into light: the generator emits a photon at the same point where it is absorbed, but moves in the opposite direction.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After placing the chips at a distance of 20 centimeters from each other, the researchers sent laser pulses through a beam splitter, which sent light to the generators. This light made one of the two generators vibrate. Then he emitted a photon, which passed through another beam splitter, and then to the detector. The experiment was set up in such a way that one excitation was divided between the oscillators. “We know for sure that one of them is excited, but we cannot say in principle which one until we measure them,” says Greblacher. Researchers cannot say which oscillator was excited without destroying the entangled state (5).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Entanglement was demonstrated earlier, but in much smaller systems - from individual atoms to clouds of cooled gases consisting of thousands of atoms. In subsequent results published last November, physicists used the same scheme to prove that entanglement satisfies </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bell's theorem</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (6). Roughly speaking, the theorem says that entangled quantum states are more strongly correlated than the laws of classical physics admit. For such a large system, such a study was the first to satisfy Bell's theorem. “This is one of the ways in which mechanical systems push boundaries,” says Greblacher.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Greblacher believes that this shows a way to use fiber optics and silicon chips to build quantum networks. This year, his group showed how this experimental setup can work with radiation in the frequency range used in telecommunications (7).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there are obstacles. When it comes to such demonstrations, the main problem is to reduce the effects of heat. For example, the Greblacher system requires that the temperature be close to absolute zero. Temperature is a measure of how fast individual atoms move, and the larger the movement, the more difficult it is to observe quantum effects. Physicists have developed tools to reduce this movement, including laser cooling, in which laser beams capture atoms and exchange high-energy electrons for lower-energy electrons, and evaporative cooling, which pumps out the highest-energy atoms, just as vaporized vapor cools Cup of tea.</font></font><br>

<h3>   </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Last April, a group led by Sillanpää from Lahti University of Technology presented another way to show the intricacies of mechanical systems. His group used tiny drums: aluminum membranes consisting of ~ 10 ^ 12 atoms and having ~ 15 micrometers in diameter that could vibrate. They cooled to almost absolute zero. Physicists damped mechanical vibrations using microwaves, so that only quantum fluctuations remained (8). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By analyzing microwaves and vibration, physicists found that the instantaneous positions of the drums were confused. If one drum was measured in position 1, then the other immediately assumed position 2. Entanglement remained as long as the drums remained under the influence of microwaves.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At first, this effect was not obvious. “It was not something we could see right away. We did not understand this data, therefore, we invited several good theorists to the team who were looking for an explanation, ”says Sillanpyaya. According to him, after more than a year of work, the analysis showed that one vibration cannot be measured without affecting another.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These large quantum systems reinforce the belief in the strangeness of quantum rules. They indicate that the separation between the quantum and classical worlds is not so much a border as in theories of objective collapse, but a disguise. “People were trying to find some fundamental principles that would limit quantum mechanics,” says condensed matter specialist Alexei Bezryadin of the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign, Illinois). “But so far no experiment can find this fundamental limit.” Such tests confirm the idea that there is no limit for quantum coherence, and if there is, it goes far beyond the scope of the experiments.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, these experiments cannot allow the human eye to directly observe what a system in two quantum states looks like at the same time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, no matter how large these mechanical systems are and how strong quantum effects, the human eye will never see an object in two places at the same time (however, you can collect statistics on the outcome of such measurements, as, for example, it </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">is planned in these experiments</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> with a single-photon source, and see the result - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">comment of a translator</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Search for suitable materials</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sillanpyaya says that now his goal is to show entanglement on a millimeter scale. The big problem is finding the right materials. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Although many things work easily on paper, they are not like that when you bring them to the lab,” says Sillanpyä. Until the material is identified, cleaned, examined, cooled, and laser-irradiated, physicists will not know if it has a structure that can be used in large quantum devices. At the University of Illinois, Bezryadin is developing materials and methods for developing quantum devices such as superconducting </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">nanowires</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (9).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He says that the most useful materials on which quantum effects are studied are those that can maintain coherence for as long as possible. Even when cooled to almost absolute zero, some materials still retain too much noise arising from the interaction of atoms or contaminants, which does not allow them to be used to study quantum behavior. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The creation of large quantum devices depends on an important balance. On the one hand, atoms must be isolated so that quantum effects do not disappear. On the other hand, they must be sensitive to commands and data. For example, in a quantum computer, a qubit must “communicate” with other qubits, and at the same time interact with the outside world.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“If it is completely inaccessible to the environment, it cannot be used,” says Bezryadin. According to him, the search for materials that meet these criteria is the “bottleneck” of this area. But physicists use computational tools and models to predict and develop materials that help overcome this obstacle. Bezryadin hopes that, like the bottlenecks in the past, physicists will overcome this as well.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to finding the right materials, physicists need to refine their recipes to create devices and large systems that exhibit quantum effects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, at NIST, Teufel spent years developing a method for producing quantum effects on aluminum drums, which, at least for quantum systems, is gigantic - it contains ~ 10 ^ 15 atoms (10). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His group found ways to cool this system to ever lower temperatures approaching absolute zero. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Their approach is to slowly eliminate noise fluctuations that can obscure quantum behavior. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And since the drum is built into the circuit, it can be useful in applications such as computers that have quantum and classical parts.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Harnessing a quantum horse</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quantum computers are applications that will benefit from the use of quantum effects in the macro world in the first place. Intricate stream qubits allow you to create experimental quantum computers that can do what classical ones cannot. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, there are photon detectors, such as a superconducting nanowire, created in 2017 by engineers from Duke University (Durham, North Carolina). Bezryadin was a pioneer in the creation of such superconducting nanowires using carbon nanotubes. A future quantum communications network may require repeaters, and these devices can use large-scale quantum effects to relay entangled states. </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Atomic clock</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> accuracy</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">connected with a cloud of entangled particles, and the more entangled particles, the more stable the clock. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A tremendous opportunity also opens up in connection with the important question of fundamental physics: how is quantum mechanics related to gravity, the least understood of all the forces of nature? Superconducting loops are unlikely to help answer this question, because the current does not have enough mass to make gravity noticeable. Larger mechanical devices, however, cannot escape the effects of gravity. “If you place a massive object in two places at the same time,” says Toyfel, “gravity has a role to play. And when you have gravity and quantum effects together, people get excited. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Physicists around the world are offering experiments using mechanical entanglement at the limit where gravity acts. The last two works in this direction were published in 2017 (11, 12), when two independent groups of theorists, one from Oxford University and the other from University College London, proposed experiments that use mechanically entangled systems to find out if gravity is quantum phenomenon. The idea of ​​these experiments is that if two objects are taken that interact only gravitationally and can create an entangled state, then gravity itself should exhibit quantum behavior.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The physicist at Oxford University, Vlatko Vedral, who developed one of these proposals, sees two main problems: control of how the system can collapse into a classical state, and differentiation of gravitational and electromagnetic effects. “I believe that this is not an insurmountable problem,” says Vedral, noting that researchers from the University of Vienna are moving forward with the design of such an experiment.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Theorist Sugato Bose of University College London, who worked on another proposal, says he is collaborating with other groups to create an interferometer that can gravitationally confuse two masses. Their plan is to start with nanoparticles and gradually increase their size, up to the order of hundreds of microns or fractions of a millimeter. He notes that groups in Montana and France are preparing similar experiments. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But not everyone agrees with this. Some physicists have argued that the proposed experimental designs use too many assumptions to finally solve the question of whether gravity is a quantum phenomenon.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite the enigmas of quantum gravity, physicists are intrigued by the consequences of studying entanglement in an observable and predictable world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fact that a mechanical system can be in two places at the same time, or that the measurement of one vibrating system has a noticeable effect on another, indicates that the boundary between the classical and quantum worlds is not only a theoretical result, but also something that can be observed and understood.</font></font><br>
