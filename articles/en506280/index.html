<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I want to share our experience of transferring employees to remote work during the quarantine period. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems to me that we approached this task as systematically as possible, and most importantly, we did not forget to organize a ‚Äúreturn‚Äù, which for many companies still looks like a distant future.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/se/2x/pn/se2xpnxva82ogwxl5v8bsh4gou8.png"><br>
<br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our offices are located in Cyprus and Asia, more than 600 people are almost evenly distributed between these two locations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each country has its own characteristics, including those related to personnel functions and cultural traditions, as employees of 48 nationalities work in the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I must say right away that we transferred 100% of the staff to a complete remote location for three months, did not stop hiring (+50 newcomers during this time), and not a single workflow was postponed or missed.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The transfer of employees to remote work was also connected with restrictions in the regions of our presence, as well as the dynamics of exiting the self-isolation regime, which is slightly different from the situation in Russia. The introduction of a self-isolation regime was phased: after long discussions at the state level, restaurants, shops and government organizations were first restricted, then they were allowed to go out once a day only when sending SMS, and they also introduced curfews. And only at the end of May restrictions in both regions began to be lifted also gradually, at first increasing the number of allowed exits to the street, and later cafes and shops were opened. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now, some employees have already decided to return to the office in whole or in part (fortunately, this is already permitted by the state), so you can summarize and give recommendations.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Looking back at March 2020, I understand that we could think a little better about the steps and organize the transition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But few thought it was serious; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">many did not believe that it would come to the point that they would be "locked up" at home and hoped that "it would somehow manage."&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Step 1.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Plan your actions as much as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The more time you work on the details, the better</font></font></h4><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We began to plan the transition to remote work two weeks before the announcement of the self-isolation regime in both countries; and we managed to do almost everything. Almost everything is a detailed company policy on doing business under COVID-19 conditions (someone will say that it is bureaucracy and pieces of paper, but if at least one of your employees gets infected at work, infects others, and it will be proved, then the company there will be serious legal consequences), a detailed Business Continuity Plan (BCP) indicating which units and how are required to work regardless of any circumstances (even arriving aliens should not interfere with some support teams), whom to provide with equipment in the first place and how to notify each employee about the introduction of emergency mode. We also conducted a test introduction of a one-day work schedule from home, but, as a result,did not have time to return the employees back and decided to leave everyone at home for another three months.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of the lessons that we learned at the planning stage, I would separately note the following:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not underestimate this challenge</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if it seems that this is a global panic and conspiracy, tomorrow they may announce that you can leave your home no more than once a day and only if absolutely necessary, and transporting computers under your houses will be very problematic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you think that transferring 600+ people to work from home is just to release the announcement that ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come to work tomorrow,‚Äù then you are mistaken. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In reality, this will require at least 2-3 weeks of preparation, information, a tough leadership hand and confidence that this is the only true option. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We had no doubt - every day was like reports from the battlefield, and we were lucky that we took on the task systematically and (almost) immediately.</font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúFrontend‚Äù and ‚ÄúBackend‚Äù work from home :)</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Maybe someone will say that it was ‚Äútoo much‚Äù to carry tables, chairs, laptops for temporary rent for employees, but we decided that the workplace at home should to be a normal workplace. Not a sofa with a pillow or a kitchen table, where a child is eating borsch, but a normal workplace, the same as in the office.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This was the most stressful part when a lot of employees had to be involved for coordination and assistance. We immediately realized that managers were already busy: talking with employees, setting work tasks (which no one had canceled) and solving hundreds of urgent issues - as a result, they would not have time to collect delivery addresses and check what size the table fits in a small employee room. HR partners turned out to be an invaluable resource: they supervised the work, communicated with each employee, coordinated the work of office managers and, most importantly, each time told employees that everything was under control. The organization of minimally convenient places took three days, after two weeks, according to the results of the survey, all employees had comfortable working conditions. Summed up only the internet,when in some locations the communication channel was not enough for constant video calls; but there was a solution with 4G modems.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What we learned from this stage:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How much is one working day of a developer</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> who pulled his back while sitting at the kitchen table on a stool? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Probably more than 30 euros for the delivery of a set of furniture. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I believe that this was the right decision, with which many (including myself) from the very beginning did not agree. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, we spent two weeks delivering furniture and equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, we had to buy something new, but the costs were not prohibitive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in conditions when then we sat at home for three months, it saved our backs, necks, head and eyes.</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><b>    </b> (       )             ,     ,    ,        .&nbsp;   ?  ,        ,      excel.     , -   ,  .<br>

</li>
</ul><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Children are active helpers at work :)</font></font><br>
</i><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This may seem unusual, but at Exness we pay a lot of attention to the families of employees, because, as a rule, relocated developers experience much more stress if the other half is unhappy or children's leisure is not organized. At the moment of quarantine, this became critical - we heard noisy children on calls, employees complained that in a two-bedroom apartment it was completely impossible to concentrate on tasks. What have we done?</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>   ,     </b> ,             .      ,    ,     (,                ).&nbsp;<br>

</li>
</ul><br>
<br>
<h4><b> 4.</b> ,   </h4> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When everyone settled home in comfortable chairs, and it was already clear that, most likely, for a long time, it became important to create uniform rules of work. Do I have to answer at 21:00 if I am still sitting at home? And if I get sick, do I need to work, because I'm still at home, or is it worth taking an official sick leave? It has become very important. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Personally, I do not like processes and policies. Well, can a normal person not understand if it is worth answering a letter in the evening or how to take a day off if you work at home? But now I agree that there should be clear guidelines for 600+ people, and the ‚Äúact in good conscience‚Äù rule no longer works.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What have we done? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We created several stream projects where we began to work out and formulate policies in blocks: remote IT support, disciplinary policy, hiring and onboarding employees remotely, labor protection when working from home, communication processes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, in almost two months we were able to prepare the entire infrastructure in the organization for effective work.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What interesting lessons we learned:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reliable and fast performer increases the chances of success. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For projects, you need to appoint managers who are effective in the conditions of a limited time, so that you do not have to additionally coordinate and ‚Äúpush‚Äù to achieve the result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stress affected everyone differently, and it‚Äôs better to immediately determine who, after a month at home, will require additional attention and support.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Step 5</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , to which many still have a long way to go, but with us it has already happened - make a decision on how to return to the office</font></font></h4><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/sa/xk/klsaxkd0_oi9mizfz9yed1z4wqu.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Almost from the first month we began to think about what we want to do when there is no longer any need to work from home, and the company must decide: are we forever remotely or what? </font></font><br>
&nbsp;<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After much deliberation, we agreed with the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hybrid mode of</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> work, when each team decides how often it will come to the office and which employees can work completely remotely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, we:&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Registered</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> which categories of employees and by what rules should work at home or in the office after quarantine has ended;</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They determined</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that we do not support the mass migration of employees from our current locations to others (although now there‚Äôs nowhere to go especially);</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Converted offices into coworking</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (one of the most interesting and creative tasks), immediately introducing a hot desks policy everywhere and completely removing dependence on jobs;</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We continue to work</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on the processes of distance communication and work in order to maximize the opportunities that we were forced to encounter.</font></font><br>
</li>
</ul><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And if now many more say that the working environment is unlikely to remain the same, we are trying to form new habits, realizing that the more flexible the organization, the more opportunities for the development and further scaling of the business.</font></font></div>
