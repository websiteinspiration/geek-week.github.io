<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My name is Lesha Svirido, I am a leading product designer at Alfa-Bank (this is what we do online banking for business). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this post I will tell you about design systems. Yes, they are written about them as often as professional burnout or remote work. The thing, frankly, has long had time to become hype, fill its edge, bring joy and disappointment, but it still remains a necessary thing. Under the cut - about why the design system is cool and how it helps us in our work. About why it's not always cool, what design systems have dark sides and how to resist them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And also a link to the Alfa-Bank design system.</font></font><br>
<br>
<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8n/zl/no/8nzlnot857rztqpc7ivynq--7su.png"></a><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's start with the obvious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People often think that a design system is designed for designers to make their life easier, that it‚Äôs such a convenient set of components that is always at hand in Sketch or Figma. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this is called a UI kit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The design system is an integral thing for the product team, which helps developers as well.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why design systems are cool</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. The issue of design scalability is excellently solved.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
We have a lot of products in our business bank, and when we launch something new, we will actively reuse these or those elements. It would be possible for each launch to sit down and draw new elements. But this, firstly, time, and secondly, violates the consistency, which I will write more below. Therefore, we reuse and are not shy. For example, when we recently launched a new digital loan product, we reused about 60% of the previously launched products, and thanks to this we launched the product very quickly. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Helps with debt management</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And not only a design duty, but also a development one. Recently, we had to go and change the green color that we use in the products to another green color. Previously, one would have to go and negotiate with the owner of each product, they say, look, it was so green, and now it will be like this. And here is why. Yes it is. True, it is necessary. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Instead, we just changed the generally accepted green at the level of the design system in a few clicks, and all teams now have new (correct) introductory notes about using green. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-j/nk/in/-jnkinavkwvh0is7gqyujiaypsw.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Helps maintain consistency</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have more than 30 products in the bank for legal entities, and it is with the help of the design system that we can normally maintain the consistency of all of them. Why is this important? Suppose a client took out a loan six months ago. Today he decided to arrange acquiring. In six months, he will open a deposit. Throughout all this time, at every step of the way, he must perceive the bank and all its products as a single whole. And if in one product something looks different than the same element in another product, this is not very correct. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Rapid prototyping</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Perhaps the only plus of the design system, which is actually sharpened more for designers, rather than the team as a whole. To test certain hypotheses, you need to make a prototype, but with its help it is not always possible to fully reproduce one or another flow that is necessary. Then the designer, together with the developer, create a prototype that they are going to test. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Improving usability</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
We have a lot of components, each of which has already been tested by battle on users. That is, we know for sure that users perceive this or that element quite unambiguously, without discrepancies and calls to friends for clarification. These are working components in which we have previously sewn up various variations and states, all this is already in the library.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tu/9g/9m/tu9g9mdwmmcy9iltnwbspz3fhm8.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And everything seems to be cool, right? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The design system is wonderful, you need to use them always and everywhere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But there are dark sides.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The dark side of design systems</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Limitations for new solutions A</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
designer can come up with excellent solutions for a product and bring it to the developer. What he shrugs, he says, they say, sorry, bros, we don‚Äôt have one in the library, we can‚Äôt do this. And here everything rests not only on the desire of the designer to ‚Äúmake beautifully‚Äù - additional factors must be evaluated. For example, the time to develop new components and the appropriateness of this process, because the very value that the client will receive after the update is not very clear. Plus a budget. Yes, in an ideal world, everything related to the budget is never a designer‚Äôs problem at all and should not affect his creative impulses. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But we live in this world, so a number of desires of the designer may well be considered inappropriate from the point of view of the budget.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Slow product evolution</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Of course, the design system is developing, but not always with the speed with which you want. Take the product here - it must develop continuously, because technological solutions may appear new, and the user‚Äôs Wishlist can be supplemented with something else, in general, forward and forth. You can‚Äôt just make a product, give it to the user and forget / score. It is very important that both designers and the rest of the team continue to work on the product, improving it and taking it to a new level, bring something else, necessary and useful to it</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's about the same story as with a phone or watch. One used to simply provide voice communications, others showed time. Today, these are gadgets with a bunch of additional features and functions, without which the end user cannot imagine them. Who needs a smartphone now, in which there will be no cameras or multimedia data transmission at all? And smart watches that show time, but are devoid of notifications and an alarm clock? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This applies to digital products no less, and sometimes more. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, it is critically important to communicate the importance of product development to products. Talk about new features and new user segments that will help increase meaningful metrics. And it is always useful and good. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Spoiled developers</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When developers work with a design system for a long time, they sometimes begin to respond to incoming requests with the mantra "This is not in the design system, sorry, we can‚Äôt do this." And here the thing is actually not that they are lazy, or they can‚Äôt, or simply don‚Äôt want to, but that they simply have such a pattern of behavior, like if they come to you with a request, you need to go to design -system, pull out the desired item from there and insert it. Such is the design system copy-paste. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Accordingly, if there is nothing in the design system, then there is nothing to get. And you need to draw it from scratch. Instead with a designer. Here, as practice shows, often everything rests precisely on the problem of communication, not everyone likes to go and agree on something in principle.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What to do? It is necessary for the designer to clearly understand why he is drawing this or that layout. And so that the developer also understands this, and just as clearly - why are we sitting here and figuring something new instead of rummaging through the design system and reusing everything happily. And then you need to scale this approach to the team as a whole. A team is a combat business unit, it is necessary that everyone understands what exactly he is responsible for. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. MVP remains MVP The</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
main purpose of the existence of any self-respecting MVP is to test some hypothesis, after which it will evolve vigorously into a product that benefits customers and money for business.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But sometimes it turns out that the MVP, which worked, simply remains as a product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the case when the approach ‚ÄúWorks - do not touch‚Äù is applied incorrectly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes it works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The hypothesis works, for which we did the MVP test. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the fact that MVP works only means that the time has come to bring it to mind (read - to the product). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No matter how trite it may sound, it is important to convey to designers and products that now they are sitting and sawing it MVP. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That it is something temporary, the first step, a test of hypothesis. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the task of the team after verification should always be to create a product.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to deal with it</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Plan and establish processes.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
You and your team should understand what you are doing today, tomorrow, in a week, at the next sprint. And also - why are you doing this. Otherwise, the meaning of the work, in principle, disappears. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If this is not done, chaos and a situation are inevitable, in which everyone just sits and unites together their own pieces of backlog. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Team enthusiasm</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Yes, it sounds like these creepy ‚Äúdream team, cookies and people with burning eyes‚Äù, but the interest of each team member in the process is more important than it seems. Of course, you can make a product with the hands of people who do not really care what they do and for what, and such a product will also work. But if there is an opportunity to do this with like-minded people - it is in every way better. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Success metrics</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They must be identified, recorded and monitored for their compliance and implementation. You drew some page - and now you can see that thanks to it the number of customers has increased. And it‚Äôs good for a person, he sees that what was created with these hands really works, and it is useful for business as a whole. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. The design system is not the police of design.</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Here it is still important: designers, including new arrivals, may begin to perceive your existing design system as a guide to action and the last resort. And a story can turn out in which the designer has a great idea for using the component, he goes to the design system, does not find it there and decides that the component is not needed, that someone has already suggested it, but they have rejected it. As a result, it turns out that a good idea fell off at the start.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If there is nothing in the design of the system, this means that it can find a place for itself there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I already wrote, the design system should develop, acquire new useful components and scenarios for their use. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Iteration</font></font></b> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
I will not be original, when working with a design system (and indeed when working), break down tasks into steps that you are able to complete and calculate, instead of just going and setting a task like ‚Äúmake it cool‚Äù.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
And one more thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Design systems have proven themselves for use in large companies, where there are many products, designers, components and more. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Because of this hype around design systems, they are trying to implement them everywhere, even in small web studios for 2-4 people, where each little bit of a designer writes in PHP and administers servers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like, since it works everywhere and it's cool for everyone, it will be like that for us too. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Will not be. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are a small startup, you do not need a design system for the sake of the design system itself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Start simply with a good UI kit and move on.</font></font></div>
