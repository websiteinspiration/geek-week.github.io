<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Modern SLR cameras still use the inventions of engineers who worked at Pentax. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once the production of their cameras was superior to Canon and Nikon combined. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the end of the century, Pentax could no longer compete with them on equal terms, but at the same time did not stop production and occupied its own special niche.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did this happen? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's find out.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Start</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The history of the Pentax company began in 1919, when Kumao Kajiwara opened a small production for the production of glasses and binoculars. The company was called the Asahi Optical Joint-Stock Company (ASAHI Optical Joint-Stock Company). "Asahi" in Japanese means "rising sun." There was still a long way to the name Pentax. Only a few employees worked for the company, but in ten years it has managed to become one of the leaders in lens manufacturing in Japan. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The secret of the company was in a special way of polishing glasses. While everyone used wool, Asahi Optical used asphalt resin. Engineers borrowed this method from telescope and telescope technology.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At this time, they were noticed by Konika, already a serious company with a forty-year history by that time, which in 1933 proposed Asahi Optical to begin production of lenses for Pearlette cameras. Konika had a simple goal: to reduce production costs and make cameras more affordable. Prior to connecting Asahi, many components were imported from Germany and other countries. Localization has helped to increase popularity by reducing prices. So, Konica cameras with lenses from Asahi have become one of the most popular in the Japanese islands.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yd/ts/lp/ydtslpmiejvqavlog_cjnjg4nio.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were a lot of orders. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And so, a year later, Asahi Optical built a new plant on the outskirts of Tokyo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lenses were produced there for the leaders of the Japanese photo market of that time - the companies Konika and Chiyoda Optical (Chiyoda Optical). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1936, the latter introduced the Minolta Flex model - a two-lens reflex camera made in the image of the German Rolleiflex. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The lenses were manufactured by Asahi Optical.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ql/yu/lf/qlyulfmdfjyuha1kh4x-aa8_mfq.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Like many manufacturers of optical equipment of those times, Asahi Optical received government orders for the production of optical sights, binoculars and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the company was headed by 27-year-old amateur photographer Saburo Matsumoto, who, despite the harsh conditions of the regime, dreamed of producing photographic equipment.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/ms/dl/dpmsdlqngkdhhlf45kal_lqojo4.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the company's website and other sources, little information was preserved about the development in wartime, but it is known that in 1945 Tokyo plants were destroyed during the bombing by American troops. Almost all workers died. This was a serious loss for Asahi Optical. The company had debts to suppliers and contractors, and it was impossible to get money for completed orders from the defeated military. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was possible to pay off debts. Through the sale of surviving equipment and materials. Thanks to this, in 1946, Matsumoto managed to restore part of the production, find workers and receive an order for processing binocular lenses from the occupation forces. By the way, the Nikon company then also carried out orders for the Americans.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
News of the refurbished factory quickly spread among industrialists. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asahi Optical began to receive orders for the production of various optical elements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, until the 1950s, the company acted as a contractor, and not as a manufacturer of its own final product.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Own product</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In May 1948, a total solar eclipse was observed in northern Japan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially for this event, Asahi Optical created a compact astronomical telescope and produced them in a small batch. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Several employees packed their telescopes in backpacks and set off to sell on Hokkaido Island. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the telescope optical tubes were made of cardboard, the high quality of the lenses compensated for the modest design. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was the right step from several points of view: the study of consumer demand and advertising companies that did not require large expenses.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Short-term success prompted President Matsumoto to decide on his own production of binoculars. The main calculation was on the high quality of the manufactured lenses and on the relatively low competition in the binoculars market. In 1948, Asahi Optical launched a new binoculars on the market - an ultra-compact Jupiter with a six-fold magnification and small 16 mm front lenses (these parameters are usually specified in the 6 √ó 16 mm format). The device, which provides unprecedented clarity and contrast (thanks in large part to the advanced enlightenment of the lenses) was an incredible success with buyers in Japan and beyond. To meet the increased demand for binoculars, I had to work until late in the evening, and sometimes at night. So the production soon jumped from five hundred pieces a month to several thousand.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rd/ym/zv/rdymzvyresroc4w_rlgkdmj4wso.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The commercial success of Jupiters has seriously strengthened the financial position of the company. Binoculars stood out on the market with lens coating, high quality and durable. Coating lenses from other manufacturers could be ruined by touch. At that time, consumer demand was so great that everything was simply swept off the shelves, regardless of the quality of the goods. But the president of the company, Matsumoto, was determined to produce only high-quality products, for which the company purchased the latest expensive equipment for processing optical surfaces and sent its employees to the laboratory of the University of Nagoya for training. In the market of optical instruments, the authority of the company was rapidly growing - the main capital of Asahi Optical.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1950, the customer for the supply of lenses was Sanwa SHOKAI, whose "spy" camera, Micro IIIA (Mycro IIIA), became extremely popular among the soldiers of the occupying forces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The popularity of the mini-camera, which was never used as truly spyware (although, who knows =), happened after people saw it in the hands of Marlene Dietrich who visited Japan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asahi Optical worked in a very busy rhythm, as the monthly production increased to 25 thousand cameras.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o1/j7/v6/o1j7v6gq-s6-vwpzhwk9mrudqb0.jpeg"></div><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cameras</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the mid-1950s, there were many companies involved in the production of photographic equipment in Japan. Among them are the now popular Canon, Nikon, Olympus and more lamp Minolta and Mamia. By that time, they had already begun to enter the international market (largely due to the presence in the country of Americans and many journalists from different countries). The military and reporters were fans of German photographic equipment: Lake and Rolleiflex (and Swedish Hasselblad). But these cameras were famous for both German quality and German price. Therefore, Japanese photographers began to simply copy German rangefinder cameras of small (35 mm) and medium format, without making improvements, but selling them at a lower price.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Matsumoto understood that in this way you will not find fame, and decided to launch a fundamentally new product on the market, more modern and perfect than all existing ones. Having carefully studied the products of the leaders of the photographic market, Asahi Optical found that SLR cameras of well-known German manufacturers were not as popular as rangefinder cameras, although they used the same format. Matsumoto's calculation was simple. Low competition among manufacturers of SLR cameras and the high quality of branded optics will allow the company to succeed in the segment of single-lens reflex cameras. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, the Asahiflex camera became the first Japanese original 35 mm SLR.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote>  ,     35-        ¬´¬ª 34- . ,         1937- ,       35- .    <i></i>   ¬´-¬ª        1936- .</blockquote><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nn/_a/7l/nn_a7l9df-bvyak2sttzyrjwobs.jpeg"></div><br>
<br>
<h4>  </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The then SLR cameras had a curious drawback: the mirror that guided the stream of light passing through the lens formed an inverted image from left to right in the viewfinder, which also disappeared for a long time after the shutter was released, regardless of the shutter speed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Matsumoto understood that releasing another copy of the German camera was somehow not handy for a self-respecting company. He set his designers a difficult task: to construct a 35-mm SLR, which in its dimensions would be close to the rangefinder Lake and at the same time would be devoid of problems with an inverted image. As a result, the leading engineers of the company - Ryohei Suzuki and Nobuyuki Yoshida - had to push hard and set up laboratories right in their homes. But they still succeeded.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yoshida designed the design of the camera itself, inside of which for the first time it was necessary to place the mechanism for raising the mirror.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/z8/mc/tfz8mcry-mfwbzqxqlhfmykckyc.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ryokhei Suzuki was responsible for the development of the lens.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iv/_n/5h/iv_n5hiopfvp7vwb9lejhgeguzo.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Seven months later, in November 1950, the prototype camera was ready. It was decided to shoot the first test film. In case of failure, the developers intended to continue working, and so far not report anything to the president of the company. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the shots turned out great.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
And then Suzuki hastened to report success. Matsumoto was very pleased with these first shots and gave the order to begin production of cameras. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The compact camera had a sturdy metal case, a proprietary 50mm f / 3.5 lens in a brass frame, and a clearly working shutter speed in the range from 1/20 to 1/500 seconds. When the shutter was released, the camera emitted a characteristic click.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At that time, Japan had a rather interesting political situation, and journalists and photo reporters came to the country, who should have liked such a convenient camera. However, despite Matsumoto‚Äôs calculations, retailers were suspicious of the new product. In their opinion, the risk of introducing a new product to the market was not justified. But the labor designers at K.Hattori &amp; Co (now Seiko Epson Corporation, which makes Epson printers, not Seiko watches) immediately noticed the new model. Literally examined it from all sides, praised, and even made several improvements. And most importantly, they offered to sell the camera in their stores. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the spring of 1952, the first batch of one hundred Asahiflex 1 cameras was released.</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wo/tv/y6/wotvy69rp9llafys_bned4yzexq.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The shipment was sent to K.Hattori &amp; Co. stores. But the next day, all the cameras were returned to the factory due to the fact that the flash did not synchronize with the shutter. The fact is that the Hattori flash worked with a delay, and during the design, the camera synchronization was tested paired with another flash. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the fall, a new batch of </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">repaired</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> cameras was sent back to Hattori stores and went on sale.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The camera was praised by photographers of that time, although it could not do without flaws. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the shutter vibrated significantly during the descent, and a powerful blow of the mirror slightly threw the camera up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, most importantly, model No. 1 did not get rid of the main problem of all then DSLRs: the disappearance of the image in the viewfinder while lifting the mirror. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many claimed that SLR cameras could not be built differently, but Matsumoto believed in the power of engineering.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asahi's second DSLR</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The flight of thought from point A to point B took two years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Japanese engineers were able to design a camera with instant auto-mirror and very soft descent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She was named Asahiflex II, and her fate was much more successful than that of the first model. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A compact DSLR has appeared on the market that can replace a rangefinder camera. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus, she had no competitors in the market.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wd/ha/ei/wdhaeifddhinxgndvuon-ivy3gy.jpeg"></div><br>
<br>
<blockquote> ¬´¬ª   ,           ,       .</blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first attempt to solve the problem of a slow mirror was made during the development of Asahiflex 1. Everything is arranged as follows: the mirror is mechanically connected to the shutter of the button and, when pressed, the mirror rises and holds in the raised position. When you release the button, it returns to its original position, again opening the viewfinder. Obviously? Well, before that, it was necessary to cock the shutter in the mirrors so that you could again see the image in the viewfinder. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main difference and advantage of Asahiflex II is the instant mirror return mechanism, an analog of which is equipped with all modern DSLRs. Before the shutter fires, he raises the mirror in a split second, and then instantly lowers it. You do not need to release the button, the image from the viewfinder disappears only for a moment, and besides, there are much fewer vibrations.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This improvement has made the camera easier and more convenient to use. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asahiflex II raised the status of DSLRs to their modern level.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Penta ***</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next revolutionary development of the company was a compact SLR camera, equipped not only with a quick auto-pick-up of the mirror, but also with a pentaprism: a five-sided mirror design that allows you to display an inverted image in the viewfinder. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the viewfinder has a familiar look for rangefinder (and modern SLR) cameras; the mirror photographer no longer needs to look at it from above. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The use of pentaprism significantly reduced light loss during reflection and allowed the construction of a compact optical system. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And also pentaprism gave the name to the chamber by which this material was signed.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The usual decision for today - pentaprism, which is hidden in the same ledge in front of the viewfinder, which is typical for any modern SLR - made a splash at the annual national photo exhibition in 1954. Everyone was interested in when the new product will appear on sale, what will be its final technical characteristics and cost. The manufacturer himself could not give an answer to the last question.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2e/3r/wd/2e3rwd_kbm28wzhwniopmjs_cpe.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Pentaprisms were then widely used in the production of periscopes, binoculars and other military optics. Actually, thanks to the experience in this area, Asahi Optical engineers came up with the idea to use the same solution in cameras. So, military developments actually formed the basis of the technology, thanks to which there are modern SLR cameras. But for cameras, it was very expensive, because mirror polishing for pentaprisms in those years was carried out manually. For the Ministry of Defense, production costs were not a problem, but a civilian product should cost sane money.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In France, there were special grinding machines, but the price for them was biting - the cost was four times the size of the fixed capital of the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But Matsumoto took a chance, got into debt and decided to buy equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And he was right: automation of production processes allowed Asahi Optical to launch production of the most advanced 35 mm SLR cameras at that time at a very attractive price.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pentaprism is a pentagonal prism in cross section with two silvery reflective surfaces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The principle of its operation is as follows: passing through the lens, the light reflected from the mirror passes through the focusing screen and falls on the pentaprism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turns the inverted mirror image on the frosted glass into a straight line, which is then perceived through the eyepiece.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The camera was so popular that they began to call the Asahi Optical company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the word Pentax itself came about as a result of the merger of the words "PENTAprism" and "refleX". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Pentax brand already existed at that time and belonged to the German company Web Zais-Ikon (VEB Zeiss-Ikon) and Asahi Optical had to re-buy this brand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the US market, the camera got the name Honeywell Pentax, named after the distribution company Hanivel Corporation.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pentax Development</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1962, the Pentax SV was released, equipped with a self-timer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the US market, this camera came out under the name Honeywell Pentax H3v. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now you can install a miniature Pentax Meter on the camera, which was associated with the shutter speed dial. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The model was equipped with a high-speed shutter, with which the photographer could reduce the shutter speed to 1/1000 of a second.</font></font><br>

The Asahi Pentax Spotmatic, which entered the market in 1964, became the most popular camera of the decade. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The model, which received the 1966 Award ‚ÄúFor Good Design‚Äù from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan, became a role model for both the Japanese and German photo industries.</font></font><br>

But a much greater achievement of the company was the release in 1971 of the Pentax Spotmatic II camera, on the top panel of which for the first time it was possible to find the same ‚Äúhot shoe‚Äù, which in 1977 became the global standard.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A hot shoe is a slide mount, an invariable attribute of all professional and many amateur cameras. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fervor</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is the presence of at least one standard contact for igniting the flash. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accordingly, the old mounts without such contact were immediately dubbed the cold shoe.</font></font></blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the early 1970s, Asahi Optical took a leading position on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Beatles influenced the popularity and recognition of Pentax cameras not only among amateur enthusiasts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pentax had at least three Beatles. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ringo Starr bought his first Pentax in Japan during the first round. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He loved photography almost as much as drumming, but because of the universal popularity that fell on the group, he had to realize his photographic potential in hotel rooms and airplanes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">George Harrison also shot at the Pentax. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His S1a was sold at auction for four thousand pounds after the death of the musician. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pentax covers half the face of Paul McCartney in the famous portrait. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And only John did not want to be like everyone else (but this is not accurate).</font></font><br>

<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marketing</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the Beatles were not united by Pentax marketing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company produced very psychedelic commercials, among which the 1964 movie called Black Man's Blues stands out, in which the black man tirelessly repeats Pentax-Pentax-Pentax:</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, the Japanese would not be Japanese, if they did not turn to the image of a schoolgirl:</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, here's another video, because Japanese ads can be watched endlessly:</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bayonet K</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1975, another important stage began for Pentax. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The K2 camera model entered the market with a completely new K mount. Prior to this, Pentax produced cameras with the classic M37 and M42 threads.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/yh/ej/qwyhejb593nnfh_pyns4j3tjiau.jpeg"></div><br>
<br>
<blockquote> ‚Äî   , , ,      .       ,    ,           ,       .     ,         ,     .<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y5/hf/lp/y5hflpirbd67oeem7hdouabxfas.gif"></div></blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Like everything new, not all pentaxists played such a system at the box office, because changing the mount obviously means replacing the entire line of lenses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But Pentax seemed ready for such sentiment and knew how to squeeze the audience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same year, two more K-series cameras were released, and to them - 27 lenses with a fixed focal length and four zooms! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This strategy has paid off. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ease of use, variety and quality of performance of the new optics won over many. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The K mount itself (with minor changes and maintaining backward compatibility) has survived to this day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And even on the most modern digital SLR Pentax, you can install any lens produced by the company in more than thirty years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's where the savings and convenience are.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Other historical points</font></font></h4><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Back in 1971, Pentax was the first manufacturer of photographic optics to apply a multilayer antireflection coating to the lenses of its lenses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We already have </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">technopop video</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> about such coverage </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font></blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But Pentax‚Äôs legendary lens inventions do not end there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As usual in fairy tales, there should be three good and bad things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bayonet - one, enlightenment - two, autofocus - three. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But about the latter a bit later. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Perhaps the most legendary camera with a new bayonet mount was the Pentax K1000, released in 1976. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fully mechanical model with a curtain shutter practicing shutter speeds in the range from 1 to 1/1000 seconds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Electricity was required only by the built-in exposure meter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the batteries were low, you could safely continue to shoot, determining the exposure by eye.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gz/os/t0/gzost0mzckf24ewp4e5nx6pbhvm.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Practice has shown that this unit worked perfectly at temperatures from +40 to ‚àí50 degrees, so it was especially fond of extreme photographers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The vast majority of pictures from the peaks of the Himalayan eight-thousanders were made with this camera. </font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Large picture by click</font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The model has lived a long and fascinating life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was produced for more than twenty years, first in Japan, then at a factory in China. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this time, 2.5 million copies were sold. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1978, the world's smallest system SLR camera with interchangeable lenses was manufactured. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The baby was called Pentax Auto 110. The model was chosen by NASA for filming in space. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The choice fell due to weight, only 172 grams.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And in 1981, the company introduced Pentax ME-F - the world's first autofocus DSLR.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4j/r9/8k/4jr98kbzap3h4tmhrboyoymd3xm.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The autofocus drive was in the lens along with the batteries, which is why the early autofocus lenses had a very </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">exotic look</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This situation was corrected in 1987 with the advent of an improved K-af mount, which allows you to place the motor inside the camera. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first camera with such a bayonet mount was the Pentax SFX, which went down in the history of photography even as the first DSLR with a built-in flash.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tk/1i/le/tk1iled9zr55seo2lzon029cxag.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1991, Pentax released the Z1 professional SLR camera, which won the prestigious Japan Camera'92 title the following year.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/6n/-d/vq6n-drspu70x0jzs_df8zuadua.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Z was the last series of professional Pentax DSLRs; by the end of the 1990s, the company no longer had the resources to fully compete with the gaining popularity of Canon.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since 1985, the development strategy of Canon was the development of the EOS system - electro-optical system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And already in 1987 came the EOS 650, which marked the beginning of the Canon EOS DSLR series, which is still in production today. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The camera supported the new at that time EF mount, which allowed autofocusing using an electric drive built into the lens, rather than into the camera. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The high technology of the Canones formed the basis of their marketing strategy and the popularity of advanced cameras began to gain momentum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Pentax, they relied on the ease of use of cameras and this was a mistake.</font></font></blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But to say that Pentax completely left the world of professional photographic equipment would be wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1979, the company introduced the Pentax 6 √ó 7 medium format camera, becoming the only company from the Japanese five leaders that has a medium format system in its arsenal.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Digital age</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 The six-megapixel * istD (read as Star-East-Dee), introduced in 2003, became the first mass full-fledged digital SLR Pentax. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the time of release, it was the most compact and inexpensive digital SLR. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With its introduction, Pentax began to rapidly gain a position in the digital camera market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, the company significantly expanded the model line of compact cameras, and also began to actively produce new DSLRs.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sc/ab/oe/scaboetsvapejajr-yg7sprt3z8.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the end of 2006, Pentax began to prepare for a merger with Hoya (Hoya Corporation). Hoya‚Äôs main goal was to strengthen his medical equipment business with Pentax‚Äôs technology. After quite a long negotiations, during which the president of Pentax was replaced, the company nevertheless became part of Hoya in 2008. The latter closed the plant in Tokyo and transferred production to the countries of Southeast Asia. So, all professional and consumer lenses are now manufactured in Vietnam, and DSLRs - in the Philippines. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the same 2006, the company secured the support of the Korean industrial giant Samsung, which debuted in the digital SLR market with the GX-1S model - the converted Pentax * ist DS2.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gv/jm/wq/gvjmwqcca141fw37tck_k1ddfuq.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since then, both corporations have introduced new mirror models almost in parallel. Serious Pentax K20D and Samsung GX-20 cameras became the last such pair - the only devices at that time in the semi-pro segment equipped with 14-megapixel arrays.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w2/la/a9/w2laa9jtzax1xotv_hietlfiluk.jpeg"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2011, Hoya decided to sell the Pentax to Ricoh, a company specializing in the production of printing and copying equipment. The deal was valued at 124.2 million dollars. The new company was called Pentax Ricoh Imaging Company, and in 2013 the word "Pentax" completely disappeared from the name. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today, Rico Corporation, continuing to develop the photo direction, focuses on the production of binoculars and telescopes, lenses for glasses, optics for video surveillance systems, geodetic and medical devices, as well as industrial printing complexes. Production of cameras under the Pentax brand is not a priority and is included in the ‚Äúother‚Äù section in financial reports.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, nevertheless, Pentax cameras have a lot of loyal fans who are ready to prove that there are no better cameras than that. Among the main forum arguments, Pentax owners talk about a large fleet of K-mount lenses that even fit modern cameras. They also praise build quality compared to the Canon and Nikon in the same price range. They necessarily indicate wonderful color rendition and admire the image stabilization mechanism, which works wonders and can be used to compensate for the Earth's rotation in astrophotography.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The merit of Asahi Optical, later Pentax, in the development of photo technology is difficult to overestimate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a 35-mm SLR, and a mechanism for soft return of the mirror, and pentaprism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without these inventions, the photoworld would not be as we know it now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They may not have been able to maintain leadership, but achievements have remained, and continue to remain relevant today. </font></font><br>
