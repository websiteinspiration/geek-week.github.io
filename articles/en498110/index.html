Over the past years, our engineering team has doubled, become distributed and international, which entailed many changes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of them was the introduction of cross-functional teams that could solve the problem completely, from developing the idea to the release of features. For this, the backend and frontend engineers had to quickly master many of the things that we had never done before: testing, working with releases, conducting scrum rituals - without losing speed and quality.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first steps in this direction led to an increase in the number of errors, a decrease in the speed of development and demotivation of teams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this difficult period, I just became a team leader, so my personal fear of failure and my own incompetence added to the general stress. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, we coped with the storm, halved Lead Time and significantly advanced in the effectiveness of cross-functional teams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was largely helped by a change in our attitude to the ongoing changes, the transition from Fixed mindset to Growth mindset. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Below is a video and a transcript of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">my performance</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> at Saint TeamLead Conf 2019, where, using my team as an example, I talk about the processes and tools that made these changes possible.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">History No. 1. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Changing the development process to reduce lead time</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2016, our development consisted of 20 people and 5 teams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Teams effectively interacted with each other, quickly exchanged information and experience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the growth of employees and teams, the introduction of CI / CD processes and code reviews, the number of interdependencies between teams increased. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, in order to launch a big feature on a prod, the team needed to work with 6 more engineering teams:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Give code to code review.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Give a feature to the QA test. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If necessary, QA will include the DevOps command to create a special test environment.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Relieve the feature using the release manager, who is responsible for all releases in the company.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Connect additional commands if something goes wrong during the release.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this is without taking into account the dependencies with the marketing, design and technical support teams, which are also actively involved in the launch of features. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The more dependencies, the more Lead Time, that is, the time from the start of development to release. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The higher the Lead Time, the less value we deliver to users. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A large number of communications and low delivery speed demotivate the team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What to do? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reduce dependencies and shorten lead time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are trying to build a conveyor in development</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To solve this problem, we first tried to build a conveyor:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Describe all stages and processes;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">introduce SLA (Service Level Agreement, level of required quality) to determine the time for which the task must go through each stage;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">straighten flows to prevent the task from retreating to the previous stages for improvements.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unfortunately, the pipeline did not work: an error at any stage led to the suspension of the entire chain, while each team was simultaneously forced to solve problems from its own backlog. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, QA needed to choose: to deal with a bug on the pipeline or to engage in tasks to improve the testing process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This problem of prioritization led to the fact that we either released features, but did not have time to improve internal processes, or were engaged in process optimization and did not have time to release features. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then we decided to rebuild the conveyor to move it inside each team.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trying to build cross-functional teams</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Cross-functional teams are able to deal with the task from beginning to end: from working out the idea to putting the finished feature on the product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this, the team needs to have inside all the necessary competencies, knowledge and processes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We decided to conduct an experiment on several teams before rolling out the changes to the entire company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My team also got into the experiment, which deals mainly with low-level tasks (I&nbsp; </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wrote about one of our work examples</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> &nbsp;- implementing ActiveMQ and Hazelcast). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The team consisted of 3 backend developers, a part-time QA engineer and me as a team leader.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We determine the interdependencies</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First of all, we determined the current dependencies that we want to get rid of:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no full-time QA engineer, as a result of which we can wait for testing from a few days to a week.</font></font></li>
<li>&nbsp;   ,   &nbsp; &nbsp;  -.</li>
<li>  full-time -,      ,   &nbsp; .</li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were other dependencies, but we decided to focus primarily on the three. Now we needed to learn a lot from what the QA engineer, Scrum master and release manager did before. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We learn to test independently.</font></font></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Previously, engineers independently wrote unit tests and tested the basic functionality, the rest checked QA. Now we have learned how to independently test borderline situations and write end-to-end tests to test the interaction between the client and server. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learning to release yourself</font></font></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
We agreed that we want to release at least once a week. To do this, we need a release manager within the team. One of the backend developers became of their own accord. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We carry out scrum rituals on our own</font></font></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The external scrum master did not have time to deal with all the teams, so inside our team we chose the one who wished for this role. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He needed to learn how to independently carry out planning, grooming and retro. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Naturally, no one threw us at the barricades. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">QA, release manager and scrum master passed knowledge and advised in difficult cases.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First failures</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The results of the first sprint were unsuccessful. We really began to bring tasks to the master branch much faster, but we were not able to independently make a single release. It turned out that our processes and scripts were not ready for this. The release script was able to release only all services at a time, so we could not release our part of the service separately. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We twisted a part of the processes and at the end of the second sprint we put the tasks out of the first sprint into the release. However, something went wrong again. Half of the released functionality contained critical bugs, so we decided to roll back the release. And they faced a new problem: our backend developer and part-time release manager in the team, learned to release, but still did not learn to roll back the changes. Therefore, we needed the help of an external release manager.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All this led to the demotivation of the team: we fail the second sprint in a row, release functionality with critical bugs - the feeling that we cannot do anything on our own.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">History No. 2. A New Role and Fear of Mistake</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the beginning of the experiment with cross-functional teams, Max, one of the backend engineers, volunteered to become a scrum master. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, after the first sprint, he came up to me and said that he no longer wanted to be a scrum master. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Following Max came Andrei, another engineer, and said that he would not be testing: "I am a developer, not a tester." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a team leader, it was important for me to understand the causes of both failures.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a rule, one of the 4 reasons that can work with each of them is the cornerstone of the decision to refuse the task:</font></font></b><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;  ‚Üí  ,     &nbsp;,  &nbsp;   .</li>
<li>&nbsp;    (, , ) ‚Üí   ,   .</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;,    ‚Üí   :   &nbsp;  ,  &nbsp; .</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;   ‚Üí   &nbsp;     &nbsp;  .</li>
</ul></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Max understood the value that the scrum master brings to the team, but was afraid not to cope with the difficult tasks of facilitating meetings. Agreeing to a new role, he knew little about the work of the scrum master and did not give himself a full account of the skills that he would need for this. Max was afraid that he could not cope, he would waste the team‚Äôs time and would look incompetent in the eyes of his colleagues. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the situation with Andrei, it turned out that he tested his code on his own and was sure that everything was fine. However, just in case, I gave QA for verification, and he found 5 bugs in the code. This was repeated several times, which demotivated Andrei, and he decided not to do testing anymore.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I was well acquainted with the situations of Max and Andrei. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I myself have recently turned from an experienced backend engineer into an inexperienced team leader. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And just as I was afraid that I could not cope with the tasks, I would not live up to expectations and, in general, team leadership was not mine.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Installation on growth and installation on a given</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When I became a team leader, I was advised to read the book " </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Flexible Consciousness</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> " by Stanford University professor </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Carol Dweck</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, it describes two types of thinking:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fixed mindset - the belief that intelligence and abilities are fixed once and for all, it is impossible to influence them, and failure indicates a lack of talent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People with such thinking try not to take complex tasks so as not to lose motivation and faith in themselves.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and abilities can be improved throughout life if efforts are made to do so. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Failure is a reason to learn something, so people with this kind of thinking are constantly trying to get out of their comfort zone and take on complex tasks.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Naturally, the world is not divided into black and white, in different situations the same person may be dominated by a different type of thinking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, a person may consider that programming is a skill that any person can learn, but at the same time he believes that cooking deliciously is a talent inherent in nature, and this cannot be learned. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n5/r1/ba/n5r1ban0salpwrcra4fp5vam9ei.png"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The whole scheme is on </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the Carol Duque website.</font></font></a><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This approach describes a person‚Äôs attitude towards the changes that are taking place.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People with a predominance of Fixed mindset (setting for granted)</font></font></b><br>
<ul>
<li> : ¬´&nbsp;  , &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  ¬ª.</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; , &nbsp; .    &nbsp;&nbsp;,  ,    &nbsp;     .</li>
</ul></blockquote><br>
<blockquote><b> &nbsp; Growth mindset ( &nbsp;)</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; ,      &nbsp;  ,   &nbsp;.</li>
<li>   &nbsp;  &nbsp;,  .</li>
<li>  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;,    .</li>
</ul></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This approach has helped me change my attitude towards errors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, I decided to talk about the approach to the team, since it could give us a single coordinate system, teach us to treat changes differently and reduce the fear of mistakes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like any tool, growth orientation works to solve specific problems, so I talked about it at 1: 1 meetings to give everyone the information that would be useful to him specifically to solve his situation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, I told everyone in the team about my own example of working with settings at the time of changing roles from engineer to team leader. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This added to the rest of self-confidence (‚ÄúI was not the only one to encounter this‚Äù, ‚Äúit is really possible to change this situation‚Äù).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Continuation of the story number 2</font></font></h2><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An experiment reduces expectations and stress.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> After discussing the approach with Growth &amp; Fixed mindset, we agreed with Max to launch an experiment in which he will try a new role as a scrum master. The word "experiment" well reduces the degree of stress. In the experiment, it‚Äôs not scary to make mistakes, but it‚Äôs important to do the work on the mistakes and make a useful experience. In the same vein, we talked about the new role of Max to the team, which lowered the expectations of the team. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Talent is earned experience.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei, when discussing his refusal to test, dropped the phrase: "I am talented in programming." It turned out that Andrei considered programming and testing to be inborn talents. He had the first, but not the second. We started discussing Andrei‚Äôs experience and realized that Andrei went through programming through sleepless nights in search of errors, days of immersion in other people's projects, independently wrote tens of thousands of lines of code. It turns out that his expertise in programming is not a talent, but an experience to which he went for a long time and purposefully. Just by learning something, we often forget about the first steps taken in this direction. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Personal OKRs.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to make our progress visible even with a slight advance, we agreed with the team that we will track the progress of each training. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This will help not only to see the path traveled, but also to understand how much more you need to go to the intended goal. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the company level, we have OKRs, so we decided to apply it for the level of personal training. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The conditions were as follows:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We add to personal OKRs only what helps in the current work;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Key Results should be measurable at any given time and help answer the question ‚ÄúHow far have I progressed compared to last week ?;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each key outcome has a list of initiatives that allow it to be achieved;</font></font></li>
<li>    (, ),    &nbsp; , &nbsp;   &nbsp;;</li>
<li>  &nbsp;OKRs &nbsp;  1:1.</li>
</ul><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Implementing personal OKRs for the quarter</font></font></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
A few weeks after the launch of the initiative, we realized that nothing was happening. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out that we stood on our own rake - overstated our own expectations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The team was worried that it was necessary to make ideal OKRs for a long time and this was a stupor. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then we agreed that we would regard this as one of the iterations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">OKRs can always be reviewed and refined, this is not something carved into stone, but rather just the direction you want to develop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This helped to perceive the initiative as an interesting game, and things went. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Example of OKRs by Andrey </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8i/id/vu/8iidvutqhw86ym1wqk1h0oxb26m.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Bonus, we agreed to share personal OKRs within the team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It helps to learn from each other and works like a public commit.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Continuation of the story number 1</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thanks to a change in attitude, in retrospects we began to look for the causes of difficulties in ourselves, and not outside. Now there were no excuses that could have sounded earlier: "So the process is built, what can I do." We began to refine processes that did not suit us. The team got a sense of ownership of the ongoing processes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This allowed us to begin to stably implement a small number of tasks. Although it was half as much as before, but we brought it to sale completely independently and without bugs. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All this added to us self-confidence. After some time, Andrey independently automated complex test cases. Roma, who is responsible for the releases, optimized the process so that each team member can now release independently.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, based on the results of the quarter, we were able to reduce Lead Time by 2 times due to the reduction of dependencies, increase of competencies within the team and change of attitude towards difficulties and mistakes.</font></font><br>
<br>
<hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our productivity is affected not only by the knowledge and skills that we possess now, but also by how we relate to changes in the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes new processes can demotivate, and tasks that are too complex can undermine self-confidence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But with this you can work both for yourself and at the level of the whole team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My team was helped to cope with the changes and attitude towards errors of the Growth &amp; Fixed mindset. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We treat it as a working tool that solves specific problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, the installation did not change in a few weeks and months. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But changing the attitude to specific situations, we were able to move forward significantly in the quarter in relation to daily work tasks and difficulties.</font></font></div>
