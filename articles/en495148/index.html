The computer was developed specifically for those users who need maximum lightness and portability. At the same time, it is equipped with displays that are suitable for serious work with graphics and Intel Ice Lake-U processors, in which the performance of the built-in GPU is greatly increased. A detailed story about these and other features of this laptop is waiting for you under the cut - welcome.</font></font><br>

<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before we begin, we allow ourselves to make a small introduction so that no one else gets confused. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Dell XPS 13 7390, which we wrote about on Habr√© a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bit earlier</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dell XPS 13 7390 ‚Äú2 in 1‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> are two different devices that look very similar in appearance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first is a classic laptop, the second is a transformer with a cover that completely swings 360 degrees back. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gadgets have different cooling systems and different layouts of internal elements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the laptop is equipped only with Intel Core U-series processors from the Comet Lake family (14 nm), and chips from the same series, but from the Ice Lake family (10 nm) with significantly higher integrated graphics performance, are installed in the transformer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And these are not all the differences; we will talk about the rest below. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And now - let's go!</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font color="#3183c1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Appearance and ergonomics</font></font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There have been no global changes in the design of our flagship laptops and transformers in the XPS line for several years in a row. But from time to time we do a little restyling. Specifically, in this model, it comes down to the transition from a display with an aspect ratio of 16: 9 to 16:10, which, of course, somewhat affected the dimensions of the device. Now it turns out that the XPS 13 7390 ‚Äú2 in 1‚Äù transformer is slightly heavier than the XPS 13 7390 laptop (1.33 kg versus 1.23 kg), but in practice this difference is difficult to feel. These are the two most portable cars that you can carry around all the time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7n/lb/is/7nlbishchfhtsgj9gkxd9u_puz4.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why are there no other changes in appearance? Because both us and our users like the established concept. The combination of brushed metal and carbon fiber does not only look beautiful, it is also very durable and not easily soiled materials. Plus it works on recognition. Anyone familiar with the Dell XPS of the past few years will recognize this mobile computer from afar. An important point for many, by the way.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yh/r1/3x/yhr13xvb4h3kzdqt4nwfkswr494.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you look at the Dell XPS 13 7390 "2 in 1" from the end, it will be seen that the shape of the case remained tapered. The thickness gradually increases from 7 to 13 mm. We also note the innovation that migrated here based on the results of the previous restyling of the series: when the user flips the back cover, the working panel of the laptop rises slightly above the table. Because of this, the cooling system can work more efficiently. Of course, in the place where the lid is in contact with the table, there is a soft rubber insert. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ov/kl/hu/ovklhuveavt-skpvtaafgw-msem.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, since this is not just a laptop, but a transformer laptop, it‚Äôs a sin not to twist it in every way and not to show how it all looks. For example, tablet mode. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ar/ug/pb/arugpb-yixwhq9qa6ygtxkc0mya.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this form, it is convenient to show presentations.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cf/54/ik/cf54ik91iaz_d01cnj9sebz7sf4.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, the console mode, in case you do not need a keyboard at all, but you need to work actively with the touch screen.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/wn/nc/rcwnncxqbmkji5lc9ddrspl7edi.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<h2><font color="#3183c1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interfaces and Communications</font></font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the main features of the Dell XPS 13 7390 2-in-1 is maximum compactness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The desire for this inevitably leads to a decrease in the thickness of the case and the abandonment of most ports. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, no one in their right mind would want to try to bend some hefty 2.5-kilogram laptop and try to use it like a tablet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the developers had to take into account the peculiarities of the form factor, and they tried not to lose rigidity: no one likes it when the lid walks in a wave at the moment of opening, and the metal from its outside is pressed down when pressed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no such thing.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/6h/g9/kn6hg9fa7nna_iskdtaketamrh8.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So there are very few connectors on the sides of the computer. The USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 support on the right side is adjacent to the combined audio input. On the opposite side, there is another similar interface and card reader for microSD (quite peppy: 140-150 MB / s for writing and up to 190-200 for reading). </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y4/tg/8a/y4tg8akmpy4uiqtx2haa2yubtk4.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So that after arriving home from the store I don‚Äôt have to worry about the question ‚Äúhow can I stick a USB flash drive‚Äù in the kit, we add a proprietary adapter from USB-C to USB-A to all XPS, and the reviewed gadget was no exception.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As an adapter responsible for wireless data transmission, the Dell XPS 13 7390 "2 in 1" uses the Killer AX1650s solution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is also Bluetooth 5.1, and support for Wi-Fi 6, which will be a good start for the already pretty near future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our reference home network, which usually includes all the laptops that we write about on Habr√©, we got a result of 350 Mbit / s for download and 410 Mbit / s for upload with a ceiling of 500/500. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not a record, but nothing to complain about. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And with the stability of communication problems have never arisen.</font></font><br>
<br>

<h2><font color="#3183c1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Input Devices</font></font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
XPS 13 7390 2-in-1 uses the second generation of the MagLev keyboard. It first appeared in XPS 15 in 2018, and has since been improved: the buttons have become a little larger, the depth of depression has been increased (up to 1.3 mm), the sound has become quieter. The principle of operation has not changed: the membrane domes responsible for returning the buttons to their original position are not provided in the design - magnets are responsible for the ‚Äúreturn‚Äù. Hence the magic of the beautiful words ‚Äúmagnetic levitation‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Is it convenient to type on such a keyboard? We and many employees in our Moscow office really like it, but of course we cannot speak for everyone in the world. Is this experience different from the classic butterfly? Definitely yes. Therefore, if you have not had any business with MagLev keyboards before, we advise you to first try it somewhere in work. Is it possible to quickly relearn? In our experience and the experience of our colleagues, quite. Even in the most difficult cases, the case is unlikely to drag on for more than a couple of weeks. The keyboard is really comfortable.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yg/ms/sa/ygmssakg7ndmtpjfpfs_xi84nmw.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We anticipate a lot of righteous indignation on the arrow keys combined with the PgUp and PgDown buttons. Each time it is very difficult for us to comment on the decisions of the global team on these issues, because it is very difficult to get input on them. We believe that the reason lies primarily in matters of unification of production. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also pay attention to this button in the top row: it works both as a power key and as a fingerprint scanner.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ja/te/kd/jatekdb84xqtd2fyqlbjokomxyi.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Previously, the functionality was similar, but the button was separate: small and round to the right of the keyboard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, as you see, there are practically no indentations on the right and left, and it was necessary to come up with an alternative solution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The FN-lock for the F-keys has not gone away, so you can always switch between F1-F12 and the volume, brightness, keyboard backlight activation functions and so on assigned to these buttons. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The touchpad at first glance seems familiar, but there are changes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared to the XPS 13 7390 laptop, the XPS 13 7390 ‚Äú2 in 1‚Äù transformer has a slightly larger touch panel: 112x66.7 mm versus 105x65 mm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its resolution also increased very significantly, which in the most positive way affected the already good level of responsiveness.</font></font><br>

<h2><font color="#3183c1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Display</font></font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We are not afraid of these big words: the screen of our XPS 7390 "2 in 1" today is definitely one of the best in the class. There are many advantages, briefly go over everything, and start with the obvious - a changed aspect ratio. Of course, 16:10 is a much more convenient option for work than 16: 9. Just because before my eyes there is more space for program interfaces and content. This led to a multiple increase in resolution: from 1920x1080 to 1920x1200 and 3840x2160 to 3840x2400. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ps/7a/g_/ps7ag_atnfhhomhowmk6zdpog1i.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, the computer is again available in versions with two different displays, and you should definitely pay attention to this. Especially if autonomy is important to you. A panel with FHD + consumes 3.07 W at maximum brightness, and a panel with UHD + more than doubles: 6.58 W.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this case, both IPS-matrices cover 100% of the sRGB range, and a display with UHD + also 90% of the wider range of DCI-P3. The maximum brightness in both cases "according to the passport" is 500 nits, in reality even more - an average of about 550. Including when working without connecting to the mains, by the way! For comparison: in the non-transformable XPS 13 7390, the limit is limited to 400 nits, and on average most laptops on the market have a brightness of no more than 300 nits. Displays, of course, touch. Glossy coating with a very good anti-glare. It may not be very convenient in direct sunlight, but in general, you can work on the street without any inconvenience.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v2/ba/ov/v2baovzne70o2ta7_o7e0lohays.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In short, a computer in any version can be successfully used to work with graphics or, if necessary, video. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in the second case, of course, everything will rest on the performance of the GPU, and XPS 15 with a discrete adapter and H-series processors will be better suited there.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font color="#3183c1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Upgrade Opportunities</font></font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Usually, we write about the possibilities for an upgrade after the block about the "stuffing", but today we decided to do it earlier. The fact is that the goal of achieving maximum compactness and rigidity of the case with a transformable design forces literally all components to be soldered to the motherboard. That's exactly what happened in the Dell XPS 13 7390 "2 in 1". If in the classic version of this PC you can replace the SSD yourself, here it is even soldered. Therefore, we recommend that you carefully pay attention to the choice of configurations - this is the case when, perhaps, it is better to take the modification a little more powerful than necessary. So to speak, "for growth."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, you can remove the bottom cover and look inside the computer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the photo on the left is a laptop, on the right is a transformer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just so that you can clearly compare the layout and see that even the cooling systems in the devices are noticeably different. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To view a photo in high resolution, just open the image in a new window. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, here's another photograph of the bottom cover. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pay attention to the number of different soft gaskets, stops and other elements working to strengthen the stiffness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, the lid itself is quite thick.</font></font><br>

<h2><font color="#3183c1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hardware and Performance</font></font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unlike the Dell XPS 13 7390 notebooks, which are equipped with Intel Core i5-10210U / i7-10510U chips in the Russian versions, the XPS 13 7390 "2 in 1" transformers are running Intel i5-1035G1 and i7-1065G7. Both that and another - the 10th generation CPU from the low-voltage U-series, but they differ greatly. The first ones are produced according to the 14-nm process technology, the second ones - according to the 10-nm process, although both have 4 cores and support 8 threads of calculations. Firstly, the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620, which has long been familiar to all of us and modest in performance, is secondly much more powerful, which increases productivity in graphic editors when rendering and editing video.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ur/eb/zy/urebzyw2vt2iavbdmajr0jtiyxk.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, another 10-nm chips have support for faster RAM. The average TDP is old (15 W), although the ‚Äúpassport‚Äù of i5 may already vary from 10 to 25 W, but from 13 to 25 W, and this hints that it is hotter than the 14-nm U-series CPU Intel At i7, the "minimum" also increased: from 10 to 12 watts.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/74/ec/qp/74ecqp6oozmqqiln2yfjlsqcxtu.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our today's review hero has a senior processor out of two possible, that is, Intel Core i7-1065G7. If we compare it in frequency with the i7-10510U, then the minimum will be 1.3 and 1.8 GHz, and the maximum - 3.9 and 4.9 GHz. It turns out less, but with a direct comparison in the Cinebench R15 / R20 tests, the 10-nanometer i7 actually gets as many points as the 14-nanometer one. This, of course, on the very first runs. If you leave a stably high load for a long time, then the results will be lower in both cases: no one canceled a certain frequency reset during heating.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Talking about the graphic component of the ultra-compact laptop chipset for the first time in many years has become really interesting! The capabilities of the CPU in Intel Ice Lake are complemented by a much more powerful adapter than before, and this applies to the chips of the entire line. Specifically, in the case of the i7-1065G7, Intel Iris Plus Graphics G7 is used with 64 processing cores and a frequency of 300-1100 MHz. And with the 3D Mark Fire Strike test, this solution is more than twice as fast as the ‚Äúembed‚Äù of the i7-10510U! It's funny that according to the benchmark, it turns out to be more productive than, for example, the discrete GeForce MX130 with 2 GB of its own memory from Latitude 5491. In the first case, everything is in order, in the second - the synthetic test is disingenuous. Of course, a discrete adapter in real life scenarios will show significantly higher efficiency.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ni/hz/ht/nihzhtw5bjcbkqag5z99rkqo40g.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What does the user face in practice in practice? Speeding up work when performing resource-intensive tasks like the same ‚Äúholy trinity‚Äù that we are constantly talking about: working with photos, editing video, rendering. Of course, the second and third are unlikely to be often done by the owner of the transformer, but if you suddenly have to, then good integrated graphics will greatly help. Another question is games. If you could only dream about games with UHD Graphics 620 in 14-nm processors, then even with the i7-1065G7 you can comfortably cut into many online projects in Full HD resolution. Often even at medium graphics settings and, of course, with FPS above 30. Well, don‚Äôt forget about the scenario ‚ÄúI take a laptop for work, but in the evenings I like to get stuck in something that‚Äôs not very‚Äú grainy ‚Äùlike Civilization, Stellaris or Endless Space.‚Äù But this machine is also suitable for this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And on this we will pass to the general PCMark 10 benchmark. In its short runs - Express and Standard - the gap between the XPS 13 7390 "2 in 1" from i7-1065G5 and XPS 13 7390 with i7-10510U is not very big: about + 5%. But in the Extended test, where the graphics capabilities are used more actively, it reaches already an impressive + 25%. At the same time, the classic laptop, with which we are comparing the hero of today's review, has a handicap: 16 GB of RAM, that is, twice as much as the transformer.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9o/ai/-7/9oai-77j9dpwmz1zgbbbx2d2eyo.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At high load, the transformer makes a little more noise than a classic laptop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The case heating in stress tests can be brought up to 50 degrees, but these are the areas of the working panel near the display that are most remote from the hands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In real scenarios, this mark is unlikely to be exceeded and is likely to remain at a level of 46-47 degrees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Warm, but not unpleasant, you can put the laptop on your knees. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a drive specifically in the sample that we are talking about today, we use the KIOXIA KBG40ZPZ SSD with 256 GB of memory. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the manufacturer, the read speed can reach up to 2.2 GB / s, the write speed - up to 1200 GB / s. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our measurements confirm this, you can read more about this line of SSDs </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note that this is not the only drive option for the XPS 13 ‚Äú2 in 1‚Äù, solutions from other memory manufacturers can also be used.</font></font><br>

Compared with the XPS 13 7390 laptop, the convertible version of the computer has a slightly reduced battery capacity: from 52 to 51 Wh. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you compare it with the previous version of the transformer, then the capacity increased by 5 W * h. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, this is all lyrics, practice is much more important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And with her everything is a little tricky.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The fact is that the screen of the tested machine is very bright, the diagonal and resolution are greater than before, and autonomy directly depends on the brightness set. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our own measurements show that the same video in a resolution of 1920x1080 can turn the computer at maximum brightness for no more than 5 hours, but if you lower the brightness to 25%, then the playback time can be almost doubled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are talking about the configuration of the XPS 13 7390 "2 in 1" with Full HD + display. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The model with the UHD + panel, of course, will discharge much faster.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As for charging, here we use a fairly compact adapter with a power of 45 watts, which is already familiar to many. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From it, the PC charges in over 2 hours. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It has a USB-C connector, so you can charge not only a laptop, but also Android smartphones, which is pretty convenient in practice.</font></font><br>

<h2><font color="#3183c1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Summary</font></font></font></h2><br>
<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Dell XPS 13 7390 ‚Äú2 in 1‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is a lightweight, beautiful and durable transforming laptop that is primarily aimed at people who often move: from office to office, to meetings, conferences, sometimes work in cafes, and so on. It is clear that in the current situation we can only dream of returning to all this, but the viruses go away and the need to work remains. As well as demand from users interested in portability.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The strengths of this PC is one of the best in the class of displays, which is interesting with an aspect ratio of 16:10, a maximum brightness level of 500-550 nits and a wide color gamut. At the same time, there are both FHD + and UHD + panels: you need to choose based on how important autonomy is to you. The second strong point is the Intel Ice Lake U-series processors with increased integrated graphics performance. Thanks to them, in comparison with Comet Lake-U, the machine copes with demanding tasks much better and - without jokes - allows you to play many games and more comfortable to perform demanding tasks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All that remains to be said is about prices, and this is also difficult in the current situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The basic version with i5-1035G1, 8 GB of RAM, Full HD + display and 256 GB on SSD starts from 105-110 thousand rubles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same modification, but with i7-1065G7 (as in this review) costs about 120 thousand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The version with i7, 512 GB on SSD, 16 GB RAM and Full HD + is still 20 thousand more expensive, and if you add a UHD + matrix, then the current landmark is 160-170 thousand rubles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, as they say, we keep our finger on the pulse and monitor the dollar. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not provide links to specific stores this time, because everything can change. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And that‚Äôs all for today. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thank you very much for reading to the end!</font></font></div>
