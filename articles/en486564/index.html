<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Experienced developers will understand what I mean, and those naive dreamers who are just thinking about moving into game dev - take my word for it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, or read the entire article from start to finish. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A little about the author - 4 years in game dev. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I managed to work with such projects as Iratus: Lord of the Dead, Utopia Syndrome, a couple of VR projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the moment I work in CrispApp studio, the main direction of which is Hidden Object games.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lr/ds/0m/lrds0my1fj3cgvmv1mqiio8tojm.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The development of the Into the Dungeon project, probably began, like any indie game with a simple dialogue: </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- ‚ÄúArturchik, go make your own game! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 -‚Äú Go! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äú</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
If I knew what I had to go through during the year that went into developing the game, I would ... agree without hesitation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Self-realization is a demanding lady and her demands are great. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I won‚Äôt trade it for anything.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Development start</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The start went briskly enough. The concept of the game was taken from an old electronic (Yes, and there are) board game by Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Core gameplay is as simple as a Kojima game (no) - you have a square box divided into cells. You select any starting cell, after which a maze is randomly created around it. One caveat - the walls of the maze are not visible. Next, the player will explore the maze (we walk only in a straight line), stumble upon the walls (the collision completes the move) and look for treasure under the protection of a ghost (dragon in the original). You become a cage near the treasure - a ghost wakes up and hunts for the player, wanting to prevent him from stealing pennies honestly earned during his life. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/k0/yx/hvk0yxjqz901dh0ghaxz4n9uncs.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Box of the game</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We just didn‚Äôt want to copy the gameplay, so we started adding new features to the game. The main task then was to diversify the gameplay, but not to overdo it with a bunch of content that would only ruin the game. There were many ideas, many of them went to the update list for better times (would be enough for 4 major updates, no less!). In the bottom line, we got 6 heroes (1 basic and 5 unique, with their own characteristics and abilities) and 4 types of traps with their bonuses counterweights. Stuck on the web? It doesn‚Äôt matter, hold the torch and burn it to hell! Poisoned by poisonous fumes? Look for the antidote faster! I think you get the point. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At this moment, we were faced with the first problem, but we will see it only after the release (I‚Äôll tell you later, we go in chronology).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Implementation went briskly, Sanka the programmer figs the code, Arthurchik prefabs the environment, sets the animation, sets the particles - beautiful, I can‚Äôt. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/po/et/vh/poetvhx89-5g-vndu-go3w50iqs.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, it turned out somehow like this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs not a prototype anymore, but it‚Äôs still far</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
from the </font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">final version</font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . It was fun to play, it caused an ass to burn on the next wall / trap, what is needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We understood that the game was not casual, from the word at all, but the understanding of the audience of geeks / nerds / desktops / role players assured us that everything was going as it should. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this stage, the second problem happened (I remind you that we will discuss the problems separately, just bend your fingers).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">File polishing</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Grinding to a pre-release state has spent a bunch of our nerves. Bugs climbed like hooks from the jungle of Vietnam, the UI was constantly overgrown with new elements, the new gameplay was tested, changed, tested again, changed, repeat all points 10 times in 3 sets. Even your memes went! </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/x9/zy/dwx9zy5mhcrdm_xjqh53j3u0t0g.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Initially, the Portal sent the player to the starting cell, but after such a case, the Portal started sending just to a random cell on the field.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were also enough sufferers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The battle between the DG and the programmer is still ongoing, there are victories and defeats on both sides, but as for me this interaction has never yielded a negative result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, I often drove into the complication of the gameplay, I wanted to make heroes pumping, everyone should register their talents, to which they told me ‚ÄúWow, wow, Palekhche! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"It's hard to implement, let's try it easier - and it worked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although we wanted to position it as an RPG, but the game remained, in fact, a puzzle and all of the above elements were useless. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This, by the way, is the third problem. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After six months of work on weekends / evenings, the game began to look something like this </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/si/i3/_v/sii3_vahkseknjcfsy8zigkrv8s.jpeg"><br>

<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dungeon and the lone magician</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Showgames on Devgamm and file polishing again</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this state, we showed the game in CrispApp, where we work, we agreed on the publication of the game. The next 3 months were simply unforgettable. If you ever decide that localizing a game in 11 languages ‚Äã‚Äãis a good idea - hit yourself in the head. Objectively - this certainly benefits the application, the game is loyal to an audience from different corners of the Earth, but subjectively make perpetual changes to the translation table, check the game in all languages, select fonts for them and upload 220 screenshots to the AppStore \ Google play ... Just be prepared for this, but I digress from the topic.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Refinement took our last strength and a breath of fresh air was a trip to Devgamm in Minsk. By the time of the trip to the exhibition, we wanted to release a game (Haha, why so funny, Lord I can‚Äôt stop laughing). Of course, nothing came of it, the game was damp, we had to put it out on low heat a little more and we went with the beta version. We printed business cards with a QR code for the jump, prepared a beautiful poster (no) and flew.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Devgamm gave a very good feedback. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We accelerated the game 2 times (now on the old version it seems that everything is moving in slow-mo), finalized the tutorial, improved the graphics, fixed bugs (the list can be extended for a long time). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We arrived with a positive attitude, since in general the game went to people, it was visible involvement, emotions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Players received the main thing from our product - fun, which means we were on the right track. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I've never been so wrong (4 problems). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And so, that day has come. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">December 13, Friday. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Symbolic release date for the dark-dark Dungeon game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Submit and the game flew to the shops.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Release and Advertising</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you think that after the release we exhaled, sat down to a beer and waited for millions of races - you think badly, ladies and gentlemen. Immediately after the release, I began to actively advertise the application. For this, a resource plate was preliminarily assembled, where our potential audience sits. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j_/ml/lk/j_mllkjyxz5jg3ohlroihniwbha.png"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The resources on which the post was made are highlighted in green, the failures / frosts are red, the white one is not written yet</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
. We had one trump card up our sleeve - an RPG humor public with an audience of 80k + subscribers, which my friend Boris allowed to use for advertising. The scheme is simple - we write to different bloggers, media, publics, we offer barter (your post is with us, our post is with you) and we get mutual profit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, this is an ungrateful thing, and that's why. Public, site and blog editors are generally divided into three types:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>  ‚Äî   ,      (1‚Äë3 ),   ,   ‚Äî .  ,       ,   .       .</li>
<li>  ‚Äî   ,       ,    ‚Äî ¬´,     ,     ‚Äî  ¬ª  ¬´   ,    ¬ª.    ,    ,  .</li>
<li>   ‚Äî   ¬´¬ª.        ,   ,       .      50%        .</li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Firstly, they freeze. Freeze hard and boring. You write to them - after 3 days silence. You write again - after 2 days silence again. For some, I spent 2 weeks of my time reminding myself and trying to get any answer. Silence. Okay, well, maybe they are armless and cannot answer me in writing, sometimes I understand. Secondly - they are greedy and there is a great example. I contacted one gaming Telegram channel to advertise the game. They unsubscribed to me on the same day, saying - "Yes, we could make a post on our channel." I joyfully sprinkle with questions about publication, what is needed, what materials. What I get 5 days of silence.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another reminder of himself stirred the correspondence. "Throw off the advertising text, screenshots, make a post." While the fish is on the hook, I throw off everything necessary for publication and ... they put up a price list for me. What for? Unclear. I always mentioned that we are indie, there is no money, but we hold on, let's barter, but they decided to pickle me for a week and set the price. Well played guys. The funny thing is even that it was a channel with 5k subscribers. I understand a gigantic audience, multi-million dollar contracts. Where are we, indie, to them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main thing that I realized during this small advertising campaign is that you need to bang your head until your forehead is broken. There was a wild feeling of importance when it was possible to get a post on IGN, a pair of publics for 200k subscribers.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A month later, the advertisement paid off, albeit modestly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">~ 6000 downloads on two platforms, a couple of times getting into the top 150 in the Board games category in the Appstore, the first in ‚Äë Apps, but, unfortunately, the expectations were completely not met. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Application retention is too low, people do not stay in the application at all and I have 5 reasons for this! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(generally 4, but the song is good). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actually, now we are moving on to the problems that I have so persistently pointed out above.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problems and their solution</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first problem is too much randomness. Initially, the gameplay emphasized miscalculation. You explored the dungeon, calculated the possible position of the ghost, took the treasure and left the dungeon. An element of chance was brought by invisible walls, but they could also be fought. Having understood the tactics of preliminary exploration of the area around the starting point and unhurried progress along the Underground, the player gave a partial vision of the structure of the maze and an understanding of where and how to move it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Adding traps made the dungeon more random dozens of times. The miscalculation of moves was pointless, since circular saws could cut you on any cell. Yes, we had the hero Thief, who informed the player that there was a trap in the next cell, but the player already erased the application after 2 levels. It was decided to transfer the thief's talent to all the heroes, which greatly improved the gameplay. The player received the treasured information about the traps, circumvented them and could see dangerous moves for him. Plus, we made more emphasis specifically on exploring the dungeon - a little more scattered bonuses, added the selection of additional gold in the form of bags of money in random cells, and most importantly now passing the level of 3 stars depended not on the least number of steps taken, but on the number deaths.If before the game pushed the player to the fastest possible passage and therefore choose the shortest, albeit dangerous, way, now the player can safely explore every corner of the dungeon before meeting with the Phantom.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second problem is complexity. Our blind belief that if we make games for geeks / nerds, then the game should be quite complicated, it was fundamentally wrong. Yes, this is not a hypercool, but the player is not a telepath. Neither the tutorial, which essentially dumped a bunch of text on the player, nor the first levels that dumped a bunch of obscure entities on the player, helped to understand the game. ‚ÄúSit yourself, mortal! "The Ghost would say, if it were real. I had to redo all levels in order to introduce game entities gradually. We play first in the core gameplay - you, the ghost and the walls. Even the ghost‚Äôs location has been made visible to the player. Then we enter 1 type of traps, play 3-4 levels with this, then 2 type of traps and so on. The wider the reach of your audience, the more likely it is that your application will not go to the cemetery of forgotten projects.The idea is obvious, but it didn‚Äôt come to this immediately, but it‚Äôs a pity.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The third problem is the positioning of the game. Initially, we present the application as a turn-based tactical RPG. And all would be nothing, but this is not RPG. The role-playing element with the heroes does not help the players at all to agree that Into the Dungeon is an RPG. From this, many people become indignant, even put a rating of 1-2 stars. Most simply fell off, realizing that they had been cheated. Moving to the Puzzle category and positioning the game as a tactical Puzzle should improve things. I say it should, since we only find out with the release of the update, and it, at the time of writing the article, is about to come out.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The fourth problem is me and only me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I wrote there - the player gets fun from the game, so is everything okay? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forget it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If a person, while testing the game, is having fun with you in the application, this is NOT equal to a good application. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A person plays here and now, he can always ask the developer what is wrong with this game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And who said that tomorrow he will return to play again? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Testing and show cases are undoubtedly important for understanding the application and how the player perceives it, but it is important to look at things objectively. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Watch, talk, get feedback, and even if it‚Äôs purely positive - analyze it again. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maybe the person didn‚Äôt understand anything at all and was glad to just play his game with the developer?</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After update</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A new wave of advertising and weekly statistics paid off - the indicators improved slightly, the other day even came in-game purchase (so rare and so desirable). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unfortunately, a large influx of new players has not yet arrived (I never left my wet dreams). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is an increase only in the daily number of players + the average duration of the game session has increased. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The problem with the tutorial has remained the main problem, there are already ideas on how to make the game even easier and more accessible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are moving in the right direction and further it should only get better (ha ha, well, again, it's too funny, stop!).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Subtotal</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Phew, there was a lot of text, but I believe that those who read to the end brought out something for themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think no one will find big revelations here, but it‚Äôs very useful to look from the side at your own mistakes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Into the Dungeon</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , this is not the last update. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Belief in the project does not die. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A little success is also success, and even if everything goes to hell, it was a great experience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the meantime, you can evaluate the game yourself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only 5 stars do not forget to put!</font></font></div>
