Scientific research is based on the relationship between the reality of nature, as it is observed, and the representation of this reality formulated by a theory in mathematical language. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If all the consequences of the theory are experimentally proven, then it is considered reasonable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This approach, which has been used for almost four centuries, has created a consistent body of knowledge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But these successes were achieved thanks to the intelligence of human beings, who, in spite of everything, can hold on to their pre-existing beliefs and prejudices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This can affect the progress of science, even the greatest minds.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First mistake</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In his main work on the general theory of relativity, Einstein wrote an equation describing the evolution of the universe in time. The solution of this equation shows that the Universe is unstable, and does not represent a huge sphere with a constant volume around which stars glide around, as was thought at that time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the beginning of the 20th century, people lived with the established idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa static Universe in which the movement of stars never changes. This is probably due to the teachings of Aristotle, who claims that the sky is unchanging, unlike the Earth, which is perishable. This idea caused a historical anomaly: in 1054, the Chinese noticed the appearance of a new light in the sky, but not a single European document mentions this. Nevertheless, it could be seen even in the afternoon, and it lasted several weeks. It was a supernova, that is, a dying star, the remains of which can still be considered as a Crab nebula. The prevailing thought in Europe did not allow people to accept a phenomenon that so strongly contradicted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan unchanging sky. Supernova is a very rare phenomenon that can be observed with the naked eye only once a century.The most recent of them dates back to 1987. So Aristotle was almost right, believing that the sky remains unchanged - at least on the scale of human life.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To stay in agreement with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa static Universe, Einstein introduced a cosmological constant into his equations, which froze the state of the Universe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His intuition led him astray: in 1929, when Hubble demonstrated that the universe was expanding, Einstein admitted that he had made "his biggest mistake."</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quantum randomness</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quantum mechanics developed at about the same time as the theory of relativity. It describes physics on an infinitely small scale. Einstein made a great contribution to this field in 1905, interpreting the photoelectric effect as a collision of electrons and photons - that is, infinitesimal particles carrying pure energy. In other words, light, which is traditionally described as a wave, behaves like a stream of particles. It was this step forward, and not the theory of relativity, that brought Einstein the Nobel Prize in 1921. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, despite this vital contribution, he stubbornly rejected the key lesson of quantum mechanics - that the world of particles is not bound by the strict determinism of classical physics. The quantum world is probabilistic. We only know how to predict the probability of an event occurring among a number of possibilities.</font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The crab nebula observed today at different wavelengths was not recorded by Europeans when it appeared in 1054. Pictures from left to right: view in radio waves, infrared rays, visible light, ultraviolet rays, x-rays, gamma rays.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In Einstein's blindness, we again see the influence of Greek philosophy. Plato taught that thought should remain ideal, free from the coincidences of reality - a noble idea, but not subject to the requirements of science. Knowledge requires perfect coordination with all predicted facts, while faith is based on the probability generated by partial observations. Einstein himself was convinced that pure thought was able to completely capture reality, but quantum randomness contradicts this hypothesis.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Einstein did not accept this fundamental indeterminism, which was formulated by his provocative sentence: "God does not play dice with the Universe." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He imagined the existence of hidden variables, that is, not yet discovered numbers outside the limits of mass, charge and spin, which physicists use to describe particles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the experiment did not support this idea. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It cannot be denied that there is a reality that surpasses our understanding - we cannot know everything about the world of infinitesimal.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Random whims of imagination</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the process of the scientific method, there is still a stage that is not completely objective. This is what leads to the conceptualization of the theory, and Einstein with his thought experiments sets a famous example of this. He stated that "imagination is more important than knowledge." Indeed, considering disparate observations, the physicist must imagine the law underlying them. Sometimes several theoretical models compete in explaining a particular phenomenon, and only at that moment logic takes over again. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúThe role of the mind is not to discover, but to prepare. This is good only for official tasks ‚Äù(Simone Vale,‚Äú Gravity and Grace ‚Äù).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thus, the progress of ideas stems from what is called intuition. This is a kind of leap in knowledge that goes beyond pure rationality. The line between objective and subjective is no longer completely solid. Thoughts come from neurons under the influence of electromagnetic impulses, some of which are especially fertile, as if a short circuit between cells occurs where randomness occurs. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But these intuitions, or ‚Äúflowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãof the human spirit, are not the same for everyone - Einstein‚Äôs brain produced ‚ÄúE = mc¬≤‚Äù, while Proust‚Äôs brain came up with a wonderful metaphor. Intuition arises by chance, but this accident is limited by the experience, culture and knowledge of each person.</font></font><br>

<h3> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This should not be shocking news that there is a reality that is not comprehended by our own mind. Without coincidence, we are guided by our instincts and habits, everything that makes us predictable. What we do is limited almost exclusively to this first layer of reality, with ordinary worries and obligatory tasks. But there is another layer of reality, one where obvious randomness is a hallmark. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúAdministrative or academic efforts will never replace the miracles of chance that we owe to great people‚Äù (Honore de Balzac, Cousin Pons).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Einstein is an example of an inventive and free spirit, but he still retained his prejudices. His "first mistake" can be summed up with the words: "I refuse to believe in the beginning of the universe." However, experiments proved that he was wrong. His verdict that God does not play dice means: "I refuse to believe in chance." However, quantum mechanics implies a mandatory accident. His proposal raises the question of whether he would believe in God in the world without chance, which would significantly limit our freedom, since we would then be limited in absolute determinism. Einstein was stubborn in his refusal. For him, the human brain must be able to know what the universe is. With much more modesty, Heisenberg teaches us that physics is limited to describing how nature reacts in the given circumstances.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quantum theory shows that complete understanding is not available to us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In turn, it offers an accident that brings both frustration and danger, and benefits. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúA man can escape the laws of this world only for a moment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moments of a pause, contemplation, pure intuition ... it is with these outbursts that he is capable of superhuman ‚Äù(Simone Weil,‚Äú Gravity and Grace ‚Äù). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Einstein, the legendary physicist, is a great example of a creative being. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, his refusal of chance is a paradox, because it is chance that makes intuition possible, allowing creative processes in both science and art.</font></font></div>
