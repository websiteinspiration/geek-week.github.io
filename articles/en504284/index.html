We have handed over to the printing house another novelty! Nearly twenty years have passed since the Agile Manifesto appeared. The legendary Robert Martin (Uncle Bob) realized that it was time to shake off the dust from the principles of Agile, and again to tell about the flexible approach not only to the new generation of programmers, but also to specialists from other industries. The author of the books “Clean Code”, “Ideal Programmer”, “Clean Architecture”, which was loved by IT people, was at the origins of Agile. Pure Agile eliminates the misunderstanding and confusion that, over the years of Agile's existence, have made it harder to use than the original plan. In essence, Agile is just a small selection of methods and tools that helps small teams of programmers manage small projects, ... but leads to great results,because every major project consists of a huge number of bricks. Five decades of working with projects of all imaginable types and sizes allow Uncle Bob to show how Agile should actually work. If you want to understand the benefits of Agile, do not look for easy ways - you need to use Agile correctly. Pure Agile tells you how to do this for developers, testers, managers, project managers, and customers.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Excerpt. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first thing to know</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What is the first thing you need to know about the project? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before you find out the name of the project or the requirements for it, before you make any movements at all, you need to get some more information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, these are the deadlines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the dates are selected, they need to be fixed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no point in discussing the terms, because they are set in connection with objective business reasons. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If September is due, it's not just that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps in September some kind of exhibition or shareholders meeting is planned, or maybe the funds will simply run out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whatever the reason, it has some important background. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the reason will not change simply because to some of the developers the volume of tasks seems overwhelming. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, requirements can change in a continuous stream that cannot be fixed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And there’s also a reason for this - customers often don’t know what exactly they want. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They seem to know what problem they need to solve, but translating such knowledge into project requirements is always difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, there is a constant reassessment and rethinking of requirements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New features are added. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some old ones disappear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The user interface changes quickly - in weeks, if not days. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is what the world of software development looks like. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this world, deadlines are fixed, and requirements are constantly changing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And somehow, in the context of all this, developers need to successfully complete the project.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Collection</font></font></h3></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The cascading model prophesied to us a way to bypass this task. To explain how seductive and ineffective it was at the same time, I will cite one meeting as an example. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was the first of May. Big boss called subordinates to the conference room. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The boss began: “We have a new project. It is necessary to finish it by the first of November. We have no requirements yet. They will be announced to us in the next couple of weeks. How long will it take to analyze the project? ” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We began to look questioningly at each other. Everyone was silent, afraid to say too much. No one had any idea what to answer. Someone mumbled: “So we have no requirements, what should we start from?”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Imagine that they are! Yelled the boss. “You know how everything works.” You are experts! I do not need exact dates. I just need to fill out the schedule somehow. Keep in mind that if it takes more than two months, you can confidently forget about the project. ” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Someone muttered questioningly: “Two months?” The boss took it as agreeing to the conditions: “Great! Just what I was thinking. Now tell me how much the design takes? ” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And again everyone froze in bewilderment, the room was filled with dead silence. We count. And we realize that until the first of November only six months. The conclusion suggests itself. "Two month?" - you ask. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“That's right! - the big boss smiled radiantly. - As I thought. And we have two months left for implementation. Thanks to everybody, you're free!"</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many readers probably remembered that something like that already happened to them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who did not have this, well, you are lucky!</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Analysis stage</font></font></h3></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, suppose we left the conference room and scattered around the offices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What to do next? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The analysis phase begins - that means you need to analyze something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But what exactly do we call analysis? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you read books on the topic of analysis in software development, you will find that each author gives his own definition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no consensus on what analysis is. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It may be the creation of a structural decomposition of requirements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or maybe - detection and specification of requirements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It may be the creation of a fundamental data model or object, and so on ... The best definition of analysis is this: that is what analysts do.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, there are obvious things. We need to evaluate the size of the project, to forecast indicators of the main technical, economic and human resources. You need to make sure that the work schedule is feasible. This is the smallest that the company will expect from us. Whatever is called analysis, this is exactly what we were going to do in the next two months. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is a kind of favorable phase of the project. Everyone quietly browses the Internet, conducts small transactions, meets with customers and users, draw beautiful graphics, simply put, have fun. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then the first of July a miracle happens. The analysis is complete.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why do we think so? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because it is already the first of July. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If, according to the schedule, the analysis stage should be completed on the first of July, then this stage is completed on the first of July. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We're not late, are you? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we will arrange a small party with balloons and fiery speeches, celebrate our transition from the analysis stage to the design stage.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Design phase</font></font></h3></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What to do now? Of course, we will design. But what is </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">design</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We know a little more about the software design phase. At this stage, we break the project into separate modules and design the interfaces between these modules. At this stage, we also assume how many teams we will need and how these teams will be interconnected. In general, the schedule of work needs to be clarified in order to draw up a plausible feasible implementation plan. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, at this stage, something unexpectedly changes. New features are added. Old functions disappear or adjust. And it would be nice to look back and analyze the changes again, but time is money. Therefore, we are trying in every possible way to make changes to the design.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then a new miracle happens. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the first of September we suddenly complete the design. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And why? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes because. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first of September. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the work schedule, we should have already finished. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No need to hesitate. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So one more party. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Balloons and speeches. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And we break through to the next stage - implementation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It would be great to crank up such a scheme once more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh, if in the same way it would be possible to complete the implementation phase! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it won’t work out that way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because upon completion of the implementation, it is required to complete the entire project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Analysis and design do not bear fruit in binary form. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They do not have unambiguous criteria for completeness. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is no objective way to know if they are held in reality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it turned out to complete these stages on time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Implementation phase</font></font></h3></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the implementation just has distinct criteria for completeness. Here it is no longer possible to accurately fool around, giving the imaginary result as valid. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the implementation stage, the ambiguity of the tasks is completely absent. We just write the code. And we have to write the code in a hurry, sticking out our tongue, because four months were simply thrown into the wind. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Meanwhile, project requirements continue to change. New features are added. Old functions disappear or adjust. We would have to go back, conduct a new analysis and make changes to the design, but ... there are only two weeks left. And at an accelerated pace, we drive all these changes into the code.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As we look at the code and compare it with the design result, we realize that we must have been out of place at the design stage, because the code itself has little to do with what was originally depicted on the wonderful graphs. But there is no time to think, because the clock is ticking, and overtime is becoming more and more. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Around October 15, someone says, “Hey, what's the date today?” When to take it? ” And here we understand that there are only two weeks left and by the first of November we will never finish. And suddenly, for the first time, our customers find out that there are some problems with the project.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Imagine their indignation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“And at the stage of analysis it was impossible to say about this? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wasn’t it then that you should have estimated the size of the project and carefully calculated the work schedule? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And why didn’t they say at the design stage? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wasn’t it then necessary to divide the project into modules, distribute the work throughout the team and calculate the human resource? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do we find out everything two weeks before the deadline? ” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And they are right, aren't they?</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Survival marathon</font></font></h3></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And the survival marathon begins. Customers are angry. Stakeholders have come to the extreme. The pressure is rising. We work overtime. Someone leaves the project. Just hell! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And already around March, we grieve in half with a result that only half meets the requirements of customers. Everyone is upset. Everyone gives up. And we swear to ourselves that the next time this will not happen. Next time we will do everything wisely. The next time the analysis and design will be performed in good faith. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I call it the bloating out of control process. We are going to work even better next time using a method that does not work. </font></font><br>
