<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What is a UPS, we all know. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For what they are needed, it seems to be also clear (in any case, I want to believe in it). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And so the hour came when we need to buy a UPS, and here the headache begins. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Which to choose? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What to look at?</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Brand Name?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A manufacturer with a century of history?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Number of installations?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cost?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Does a colleague have the same?</font></font></li>
</ul><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's get it right.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Brand fame</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the word UPS, we immediately recall the company APC, this abbreviation is strongly associated with UPS, especially in Russia. And really, who does not know this? </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ij/ty/wu/ijtywu-z4pc8ecc4quiirw0prwa.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Or the Legrand company, among other things, founded in 1860. And APC was founded in 1981. APC launched its first UPS in 1984, which it developed after the cessation of state funding for solar energy development. The Legrand company released its UPS after 2010, and that is because in 2010 it bought the MetaSystem company.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The APC company fellows - certainly, only until 2007 APC company did not let out 3-phase powerful UPSs. Moreover, APC has never released a 3-phase UPS. In 2006, APC was acquired by Schneider Electric, an equally respected company founded in France in 1836. At the beginning of its journey, the company was called Schneider and exclusively engaged in the production of weapons for the French army and for export to the flesh until the end of World War II. Only in the post-war period was it reoriented towards the electrical market, adding Electric to the name. (an interesting fact: Many artillery pieces of the Russian Empire were purchased from Schneider)</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, Schneider Electric acquired APC in 2006, with the firm intention to cross efforts with MGE, which was also successfully acquired in 2007 - thereby firmly occupying a niche in the market. But the European Antimonopoly Committee did not approve the deal (at least something the Europeans did not approve of the topic) and split the MGE company between two buyers. The 3-phase direction went to Schneider Electric and was integrated into the APC by Schneider Electric product line, and the EATON (founded in 1911 in the USA and originally specializing in the production of automobile axles for trucks) took over the single-phase direction, which also took advantage of it and bought Powerware, teamed up shortly before with Best Power, with their powerful 3-phase systems.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I really like the history of companies, I can talk about it for a long time and selflessly, sorting through the bright pages of the history of the brands PowerCom, CE + T, Riello, Socomec, Newave - sold at ABB, Delta and Huawei are a little aloof - their story needs to be told separately, without forgetting Kehua.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lt/sy/sb/ltsysbpxhb1w8c0nsrf4fcbv8sc.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I‚Äôll stay a bit on GE (the United States was founded in 1878 and this is the only company that started with electricity, probably because they did it - electricity) - these peppers were at the forefront all the time, in fact, Edisson and Tesla, and more precisely, we owe their opposition to all that surrounds us now: generation and transport of electricity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But now is not about that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GE is very successful because it has always been able to focus on the main thing, and not the right thing to sell. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the sale of the entire segment of the development and production of electronic computers by Honeywell in 1971 as a loss-making direction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or selling the entire ABB UPS segment in 2017. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's finish with the story and summarize. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is worth noting 2 of our possible selection factors:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Brand fame</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A manufacturer with 100 years of history</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Because it is absolutely not important! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The UPS itself, in the form we are used to seeing them, appeared quite recently the end of the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s and for this small period of time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And during this short period of time, almost everyone in the market managed to resell and re-buy each other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fundamentally not developing a technology, but only integrating it into its product line. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Did UPS beat before the 80s? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes there were, only they were not called that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They were mechanical as well known as 3-machine converters and they are more likely the progenitors of modern diesel dynamic UPSs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any case, the principles are the same. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the statements of the DDIBP manufacturers about the uniqueness and innovativeness of their developments are not completely true. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We pass to the following.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Number of installations</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The number of installations - a good factor, it shows confidence in the equipment (as the manufacturers explain to us) I'll tell you honestly - IT DOES NOT SHOW ANYTHING, except for the successful work of the sales department, but you can always look at what you buy in the natural habitat, you can even listen to the local operation service about how this machine works seamlessly at their facility - curious, but no more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because you are dragged into the subjective side of the assessment and the subjective way of choosing.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cost</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I will say succinctly - one of the most important factors, but it has nothing to do with the price of the purchased equipment, which is announced to you by the seller. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So what to rely on? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Where to look? </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/7z/8s/za7z8shqvyiqdvhkuhk8kk8rca0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At one time, I found myself in this situation more than once. And each decision was like a sapper‚Äôs action on a minefield. But in data centers it is not customary to do so. The principle of "Dementia and courage" does not bring results in the long run. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thinking about this, I came to a very simple conclusion - an ideal UPS does not exist and a good UPS does not exist either. They are all the same! (this is not a literal definition, all the same, the development departments are not in vain eating their bread and red caviar from vendors) You just need to choose the UPS that suits you right here and now. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then what to be guided by, you ask?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now I will try to bring you to this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Recently I studied at the Uptime Institute and there was one phrase in the prologue to the course: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/3g/71/pd3g71kb5f2ryd1ce2yg8fscomq.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúStarting the path, you must clearly understand where you want to be‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I was amazed at the accuracy and capacity of this phrase, which gives a methodology for solving all possible problems. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Returning to the UPS, what is important for us, as for future owners of this beautiful fake? As little as possible to experience problems with our UPS. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And the first thing to look at is the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">service.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Is a specific UPS service available in your area, how many companies can do it, how much it costs. How many specialists on specific equipment in the area where our UPS will be. Does that Service Partner have enough qualified engineers with whom you plan to contract? </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Example:</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
One famous Italian brand, or rather, Russian OEM of a famous Italian brand. A good price for a UPS, many people sell it, a lot of installations, including those in St. Petersburg, but there are no engineers who can repair it, really take it apart, find the fault and fix it. And then adjust correctly and optimally for specific conditions and place of work after the "specialists" in Poland.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I suffered a lot, sorting through service companies, I was angry and spoke in every possible way negatively about this Russian OEM of the Italian brand, about the Italian brand itself and about all those involved in it. But I found a service partner who had all the necessary competencies and a sufficient number of engineers, which allowed me to completely close the problems with this UPS. Now I think these UPSs are completely reliable, but my opinion is not important. I might not find this service partner and would continue to be indignant. But first things first. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second thing you need to pay attention to is </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">spare parts and consumables</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Namely, the cost, availability, condition of sale of delivery. It is very important! </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Example:</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One famous Chinese brand. He supplied me with his UPS. New UPS model. The first copy imported into Russia. NDP ends, the car surrenders and is idling for the weekend. On Monday, adjusters arrive at the car, which turned off with an error and abandoned the exit. After a couple of phone calls and 14 hours of waiting, the volume of spare parts arrives, sufficient to collect another 2 UPS. Comes immediately to the object.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
You will say that this is not an honest example, such as the guarantee of a vendor in the process of commissioning or carrier (we found out later when we considered who owed how much and to whom) but I do not agree with you. As an illustration, another case with a NDP of a famous Finnish brand (at that time Finnish) spare parts, namely motherboards for one UPS, waited about a month.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Urgent purchase of component boards that are not included in the list of consumables of the respected Swiss division of the American brand may not be completed in 2 months. Tested by personal example. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From here, we smoothly proceed to the following - this is the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">presence of a brand representation</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the country, the availability of representation, an understandable and transparent guarantee policy. After all, it is the representation of the brand or vendor (how anyone likes it) that will be your arbiter, your knowledge base, your training center, your technical support and your guide to the world of the brand. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Example:</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first described example with an Italian brand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It so happened that this brand does not have a representative office in Russia, which is why it is necessary to solve a lot of issues with their equipment in a very strange way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Which might not have arisen if it were in Russia. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Including with the service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because one of the most important functions of a representative office is to roll out the company's technical policy, including for service programs. </font></font></i><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To summarize, I want to draw your close attention to answering these simple questions about UPS. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And making sure that all these questions received answers that suit you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can say for sure that you will not have problems with specific equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More precisely, they will be and a lot, but you can always solve them quickly and efficiently! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Pay attention to it, choose the equipment wisely!</font></font></div>
