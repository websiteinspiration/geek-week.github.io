" </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Network-centric combat operations</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> " - the most popular military concept at the moment. In its framework, soldiers fight not only with weapons, but also with the help of a web of sensors and computing power, giving them and their commanders an advantage in assessing the situation on the battlefield. However, the problem that this approach is intended to solve has always existed. I'm here, the enemy is out there. How to find him? How to track? How to find out where to move after the start of the battle? How can I even track my troops?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Long before the concepts of the Internet of things flooded the entire planet, 20th century squadrons were the first to use a systematic approach in answering these questions. Sails gave way to steam engines, and European colonies sprawled around the world. Warships began to move even faster and required coordination on even larger sections of the seas than before. Meanwhile, telegraphs and radio made it possible to instantly exchange messages at unthinkable distances. All of this together revolutionized the use of information by the navy.</font></font><br>

If you played strategy games such as StarCraft or Civilization, or watched techno-thrillers from the Cold War, you saw an ideal perspective for the commander: a map on which all the positions and status of friendly and enemy troops are shown and tracked in real time. Such a unified and general picture gives commanders such a bird's-eye view of the battlefield, which can be used to make accurate decisions. But how did the commanders recreate such a picture without computers, GPS and communication satellites? How did they keep their cards up to date?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today it will be difficult to believe, but the greatest fleets of the past used different methods, which entailed significant changes in the tactics, strategy, design of warships, and as a result, the course of the battles themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is no exaggeration to say that some of the greatest battles of the First and Second World War turned to an increase not only in combat, but also in computing power.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Battlecruisers and the birth of the Infocentric Warfare</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1900, the British Empire was at its peak, and the Royal Navy ruled the seas. However, the British had a problem. The most likely enemies of the crown were Russia and France, who knew that they could not stand up to the Royal Navy in a direct clash. Instead, they built </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">armored cruisers</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - powerful warships capable of sinking anything less than a battleship, and at the same time having great speed. In the event of war, these ships could be set against the sea trade routes of Britain, which posed an existential threat to the Empire, held only by sea trade.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To cope with this threat, Britain began to build its own armored cruisers, which were faster and better armed than the French and Russian ships. However, it was not easy to find a ship on the high seas, so Britain needed to build enough armored cruisers to place them on all trade routes. Attempts to close all the holes in the defense quickly turned into too expensive a treat. Although the British Empire was rich, it had to come up with a different strategy. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then Admiral </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">John Arbuthnot ‚ÄúJackie‚Äù Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher of Kilverstone, enters the scene</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .

He is famous for technical innovation, and most of all for his concept</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dreadnought</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> [by name of the first ship of this class, His Majesty's ship " </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dreadnought</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ", from the English. dreadnought - ‚Äúundaunted‚Äù]. This concept set the trend for all subsequent warships. Less well known is that Fisher was originally appointed not to realize his ideas for turning the Royal Navy into a more powerful military force, but to stop the exorbitant inflation of the naval budget. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
His solution to the problem of armored cruisers was another revolutionary concept: the battlecruiser. Its speed was supposed to exceed the speed of any armored cruiser, and the armament should correspond to that of the battleship. Theoretically, he could overtake and destroy any armored cruiser, remaining out of the reach of his guns.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Battle cruisers were so important that the original Navy decided to build only one new battleship to try out the concept of dreadnoughts in fact, but almost immediately the fleet built three more battle cruisers class " </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Invincible</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> " [from the English. invincible - ‚Äúinvincible‚Äù]. The history of battlecruisers is too controversial to delve into it as part of this article. However, it is worth raising one question - why could Fisher, or someone else, decide that the construction of such ships was a good idea? And why, despite the budget problems, the British began to build ships even more expensive than those armored cruisers, which they came to replace?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The answer to these questions is less obvious and not so well known - because it is not connected with the technology of ships, but with the way Fisher imagined their application. Norman Friedman discusses this topic in detail in his book ‚ÄúBattles in the Great War at Sea: Strategy, Tactics and Technology‚Äù [ </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fighting the Great War at Sea: Strategy, Tactics and Technology</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ].</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you compare the British battlecruiser with the battleship of those times, you can find several obvious differences: for example, fewer guns and more chimneys. However, there is a more subtle difference - battlecruisers were equipped with high masts, on which long-range radio antennas were mounted. These antennas allowed them to communicate with ground stations located hundreds or even thousands of miles away, and this was the key to a new type of cruising warfare. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compare it with the Dreadnought battleship - more guns, more armor, but only one tripod mast</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fisher knew that Britain could not afford to build enough battlecruisers to protect all trade routes. However, she would not have to do this - Britain was a superpower not only at sea, but also in the information field. Over the past few decades, British companies have been building a global network of telegraph cables and radio transmitters, so Britain has access to the best communications infrastructure in the world.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Instead of sending battlecruisers to the ends of the earth, and patrolling there, hoping to find the enemy‚Äôs battleships, Fischer suggested just waiting. Reports of attacks on British trucking would be immediately transmitted to the Admiralty (headquarters of the British Navy) in London, and based on them there would be a complete picture of the location and operations of enemy battleships. Then the Admiralty could only send battlecruisers to the right places in order to find and destroy these enemies. It was like aiming, but instead of trying to get into the ship with a cannon shell, the battlecruisers themselves would be shells fired by the Admiralty.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To realize this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcentralized fleet control from battlecruisers, Fisher needed a clear picture of the real threats. Therefore, he organized a top secret building in the Admiralty building, where intelligence and news about cargo transportation from around the world were collected on large maps, where the positions of all friendly and enemy ships were visible.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This system was known as the Admiralty Plan. Unlike monitors in modern headquarters, which can be updated every minute or every second, these paper maps were updated every few hours or even days. But they were still revolutionary, because for the first time in history, a centralized commander could look at a representation of the maritime situation of the whole world, in which all allies and all known enemy forces around the world were tracked in almost real time. The British command could issue orders in accordance with this situation. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Such was the innovative strategy of using battlecruisers, and it was especially useful in one of the impressive battles during the First World War.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shortly before the outbreak of war, an East Asian German squadron left its base in Qingdao, China. Impressive naval forces with powerful artillery, the core of which were the armored cruisers</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Scharnhorst</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Gneisenau</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , were commanded by Admiral Count</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Maximilian von Spee</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , perhaps the most impudent and innovative commander in the Navy of the German Empire.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After the declaration of war, the East Asian squadron began to behave exactly as the early strategists of France and Russia planned - for several months it made a rustle on British trade routes in the Pacific Ocean. In the end, they crossed the Pacific Ocean and destroyed a small detachment of British battleships off the coast of South America in the battle of Coronel. This was the most devastating defeat of all that the Royal Navy had encountered in the previous hundred years. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, radio communications by British traders who were captured or sunk allowed the Admiralty to pinpoint the location of German forces when they crossed the Pacific Ocean and rounded Cape Horn. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Royal Navy dispatched its battlecruisers, Invincible and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Inflexible</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"[English" unbending "] to the south of the Atlantic. And there, in the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">battle of the Falkland Islands, the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> German squadron was powdered by British battlecruisers superior in strength and range of shots of guns. This was precisely the case for which they were developed battle cruisers that proved the efficiency of not only Fisher‚Äôs ships, but also of its infocentric strategy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This was the highest achievement for battle cruisers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately for their reputation, after that the Royal Navy was drawn into a completely different kind of war than the one for which they were designed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Germany, unlike France and Russia, decided not to concentrate on battleships attacking merchant ships. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They decided to attack Britain directly, and build their own fleet of battleships and battle cruisers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These sea monsters eventually met in the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Battle of Jutland</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in 1916. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There, the British battlecruisers suffered a difficult fate - and this is another story that goes beyond the scope of this article. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In its framework there remains only the critically important, almost decisive role of the information played by it in this battle.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cards on the table: battleships near Jutland</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The British quickly realized that such "large-scale" representations of what was happening, like the Admiralty‚Äôs plan, were useful for both the sea and land. For hundreds of years, admirals commanded the fleets on the basis of only what the eye could see. Naval battles quickly slipped into disordered dumps, and admirals usually could do little for battle tactics, except to put into practice Nelson‚Äôs famous aphorism, which states that ‚Äúnot a single captain will make a serious mistake by turning his ship parallel to the enemy‚Äôs ship.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The situation began to change in the years preceding the First World War. The British fleet grew at an incredible pace, and its commanders needed to better understand where the allies were and where the opponents were, so as not to shell their own and occupy a superior position in relation to the enemy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then the British transferred the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a real-time location of forces at sea. They created tablet tables - large desktop maps that were updated every few minutes, showing the location of the ships of allies and opponents. These were smaller versions of the plans used by the Admiralty. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And to supply these plans with information, in addition to large rangefinders used to determine the distance to enemy ships during firing, they equipped the ships with small tactical rangefinders, which were used to measure the distance to their ships and their location.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This progress can be observed by studying the changes in battleships that have occurred over time. Before the dreadnought appeared, for example, in the Russo-Japanese War of 1906, the bridges had a fairly simple structure. In fact, it was an open platform on which the admiral and several signalmen could stand, and there were no objects hindering the review so that the admiral could see everything around as far as possible. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c01/8a9/455/c018a94553648156ae0e95a02ef24ee5.png"><br>

On the right is a picture of the Japanese commander during the battle.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But with the growth of requests for information for building plans, requests for free space also grew. After all, without computers, everything had to be physically designated. The admiral needed several plans at different scales and resolutions. What was needed was a large, strategic plan, which indicated the location of entire fleets in the territory of hundreds of miles, which could be used to plan strategic movements. Smaller plans were needed, where separate ships were shown during the battle. It is impossible to ‚Äúzoom in" on paper, so each plan needed a separate table.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And although the simplest analog computers already existed to calculate the shooting parameters, it was necessary to track the ships and calculate their course manually, people with paper and slide rules. Therefore, each table required its own team of officers and sailors to update the location of each tracked ship or fleet, as well as people who transmit and record measurements made using rangefinders. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Over time, large structures grew on battleships - large structures, which are something like small office centers where the admiral and personnel could work and manage their operations. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
British innovation led to a landslide victory in the Battle of Jutland, which was the first and last meeting of entire fleets of Britain and Germany in World War I. The battle became massive - 151 warships of the British Great Fleet against 99 ships of the German High Seas Fleet. Twenty-eight British dreadnought plus nine battlecruisers versus 16 German dreadnought and five battlecruisers. This has become, and remains, the largest clash of battleships in history. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The results were predictable. The British fleet was able to take a superior position. In the era of battleships, the ideal position was the top of the letter T - that is, you had to board the enemy so that all the guns of your ship could fire a salvo, and the enemy ship would point at you with your nose, and could only shoot from bow guns, which were much smaller . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thanks to the superior awareness of the situation provided by the construction of battle maps, Jellico twice managed to occupy the advantageous position of the letter T in the ships of Scheer. In addition, in the evening he was able to take a position between the German fleet and its base. The German fleet suffered serious damage, and it seemed that the British could only finish it off in the morning.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, as is often the case with serious innovations, it was still necessary to hone many details in practice. So it was with tablet tables. Remember how much space these tables occupied with the people serving them? And this means that they could be placed only on the largest ships. Also, due to the limited capacity of Morse code and signal flags, the overall picture observed on the flagship was very difficult to recreate on other ships. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That night, the German fleet made a breakthrough towards the house, and in the process went through the ranks of observing destroyers and light cruisers, which were supposed to be the eyes and ears of the British.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The captains of light British ships knew that their admiral, using the battle plan, usually has a more complete picture of the general situation than they do. Therefore, each of them fought on their own, and, assuming that the commander understands the general course of the battle better than they did, they did not even bother to tell the command details of their location. Jelliko only knew that some of his light ships were involved in isolated battles with German forces, but where, at what time and how many of them remained unclear. The captains of the ships did not understand that the general picture of the battle to the admiral was helped by their reports. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And in the morning it was already too late. The German fleet slipped through the gap and was on the way home.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite this setback, it was clear that the tablet table more than proved its usefulness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This quickly became known to the British allies during the First World War, the main of which were the US Navy and Japan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Both sides, which will subsequently become hostile, learned a lot, working together with the main sea power of the world, and they took this knowledge home with them. </font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leyte Gulf and Tablet Table Rematch</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The tablet table has become such an important part of the US and Japanese fleets that it could possibly explain one of the long-standing naval mysteries of World War II. </font></font><br>

<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The battle at Leyte Gulf</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in October 1944 was the largest naval battle in history. To regain the Philippines, the US fleet gathered the combined forces of two fleets. The 7th Fleet consisted of older battleships and small escort aircraft carriers, and although it was a supporting force, its firepower exceeded the entire combined power of the American fleet before the war. Further into the sea, aircraft carriers and fast battleships of the 3rd Fleet, the largest gathering of naval forces in history, were under the command of Admiral </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">William Frederick Halsey</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , nicknamed the "Buffalo".</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And although they had an advantage over the Japanese imperial fleet, the latter still represented a powerful adversary. And he was not going to give up without a fight. The Japanese fleet has developed a sophisticated multi-stage plan for dividing the strength of the American fleets, so that it can attack directly vulnerable transport ships carrying infantry and supplies for invasion.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Japanese forces were about to sacrifice the aircraft carriers that remained with them, having lost most of the pilots and aircraft, as bait in order to lure the aircraft carriers of Halsey to the north. This would allow the Central Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, to attack vulnerable transport ships in conjunction with the Southern Forces. The central unit, in the heart of which were the super battleships Yamato and Musashi, with the support of other battleships and cruisers, was the deadliest of all the troops of Japan. Together, all these troops made up the entire Japanese Navy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The initial phases of the battle were not in favor of the Japanese. American submarines sunk several ships of Kurita, including the flagship, the heavy cruiser Atago. Air attacks from aircraft carriers Halsey also sank the battleship Musashi and forced Kurita to turn around. Early in the morning of October 25, 1944, the Southern forces were destroyed by battleships of the 7th Fleet in the Surigao Strait, the old Pearl Harbor veterans, raised and updated.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But after sunrise, the situation changed. On the eve, considering that the Central Connection of Kurita was broken and retreating, Halsey turned north in pursuit of Japanese aircraft carriers. But Kurita decided to turn around. And now, when Halsey‚Äôs 5th Fleet went north, and the 7th Fleet‚Äôs battleships went south, the only thing that stood between the battleships of Kurita and the transport ships of the occupation fleet were the Taffy-3 escort aircraft carriers - one of the most small ships throughout the 7th fleet. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The battle was uneven. Against the four battleships of the Central Compound (including the Yamato, which weighed like all the American ships opposing it, combined), six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and 11 destroyers, the Tuffy-3 could oppose only six miserable escort aircraft carriers, three destroyers and four escort destroyer.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Officially escort aircraft carriers were classified under the CVE code - Carrier, aViation, Escort. Unofficially, sailors transcribed this abbreviation as Combustible, Vulnerable, Expendable (flammable, vulnerable, disposable). They didn‚Äôt even have armor-piercing shells - they had to shell the Japanese infantry on land, and not fight against the pride of the imperial Japanese fleet. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Taffy-3 group fought bravely, using planes from the nearby Tuffy-1 and Taffy-2 groups. Tiny destroyers made suicide attacks against battleships 30 times larger, and the planes in which the ammunition ran out flew over, causing the Japanese ships to maneuver. One of the pilots even defused his 38-caliber pistol from the cockpit, aiming at a Japanese ship.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The brave battle ‚ÄúTaffy-3‚Äù became the legendary, desperate last line of defense, which will then go down in history. And these small aircraft carriers even managed to sink several Kurita cruisers. But that was not enough. They were able to delay the battleships of Kurita, but not to sink them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But when, it seemed, everything was lost for the Americans, when escort aircraft carriers fled from Kurita, and the transport ships of the invaders were within reach, Kurita ordered the Japanese fleet to turn around and go home. The largest and most powerful battleship ever built has put several cargo ships to flight. What happened</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the end of the battle, Kurita gave confused explanations of why he had turned around. But in the end, he settled on the fact that in the heat of battle, he decided that he had encountered the main aircraft carriers of Halsey, and that if he had not turned around, he would have been destroyed by an air attack and the battleships of Halsey. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Historians have argued for decades about how this could happen. How could Kurita mix up the small and slow Taffy 3 escort carriers with the Halsey carriers, which were three times as large? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were probably many reasons for this, including exhaustion, and the stress caused by the flooding of the flagship. But in recent years, some historians, as Norman Friedman writes in his book Network-Centric Combat: How the Navy Learned to Fight Smarter during Three World Wars [</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Network Centric Warfare: How Navies Learned to Fight Smarter Through Three World Wars</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ], came to different conclusions. And they bring us back to the tablet table. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Admiral Kurita spent most of the battle in Leyte Gulf from the battleship Yamato, to which he switched after losing the flagship, the Atago cruiser. The cruiser sank so quickly that Kurita had to escape by swimming, and in the process he suffered two critical losses. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e48/4a4/2ae/e484a42ae5bbe987c5ed757946835cda.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Heavy Atago Japanese cruiser, Admiral Kurita's flagship in battle in Leyte Gulf</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first were tablet tables. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He lost both strategic and tactical plans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The tactical raft could be recreated at some level after the admiral switched to Yamato, but critical information from the strategic plan ‚Äî the location of several American fleets relative to the Japanese ‚Äî was lost.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second, perhaps more important loss, was the loss of a large part of his staff who served on the Atago. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recall that it was the state of the admiral that was engaged in updating the positions of ships, counting speeds and courses, and was the computing force that allowed us to remain aware of the situation that the admiral relied on when making decisions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This meant that even if he had the information to build a better picture of what was happening, he would not be able to use it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He simply did not have enough capacity to handle it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This answers one question that historians had for this battle. Externally, one aircraft carrier is similar to another, and perhaps in the heat of battle, in the smoke obscuring all, it is easy to confuse a small escort aircraft carrier with a large aircraft carrier located a little further. However, the aircraft carriers were fast ships, much faster than the battleships of Kurita. And escort aircraft carriers converted from tankers and cargo ships were much slower. When the battleships were approaching the small aircraft carriers, and their artillerymen with anti-aircraft guns watched helplessly, the officer cheered them up, exclaiming ‚Äúwait a bit, guys, we lure them to a shot distance of 40 mm caliber!‚Äù How could Kurita not notice that his fleet was catching up with small Taffy 3 escort carriers?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The answer, of course, is that he did not understand this. He could determine his location relative to the American aircraft carriers according to his plan, but he did not have enough hands to update this plan in real time. And without a strategic plan, Kurita had a very vague idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhere the rest of the American ships are. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So all he knew was that he was constantly bombarded by planes from nearby aircraft carriers, and he had no idea where the main American forces were. As far as he knew, at any moment he could be overtaken by large and fast battleships of the American Navy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, being only a few miles from vulnerable American ships, when several small escort aircraft carriers stood between him and complete victory, Kurita turned and went home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because his awareness of the situation was destroyed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He had enough firepower, but not enough computing.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Epilogue: Computing, Air War, and the Future</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The last great clash of warships occurred in Leyte Gulf. Over the past 75 years, the U.S. Navy has been a major force at sea, and because of its dominance, has not been very worried about naval battles, concentrating on threats from submarines and aircraft. The unique demands of such hostilities have further increased the importance of situational awareness and information. Submarines influenced this because of their stealth, and airplanes because of speed, which made tracking them even more important. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this sense, Leyte Gulf allowed the US Navy to look into its future. He noted the emergence of a new disaster: suicide attacks. The following year, pilots of Japanese special assault squads, known as </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">kamikaze</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , wreaked havoc on the U.S. Navy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The use of radars to track the enemy allowed the United States to finally defeat the Japanese imperial fleet, once the best in the world. However, older planes used by special assault squads, flying singly or in small groups, overwhelmed the ability to manually track Americans, and many of the planes broke through the defenses. These were massive attacks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shortly after the war, the USSR adopted the technology of guided missiles to combat ships, which was first used by the Germans during World War II. This new threat replicated the kamikaze attacks and threatened to overload the American defense. Therefore, the US Navy had to come up with even more complex computerized systems, which eventually led to the emergence of the famous system " </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Aegis</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"which modern warships are equipped with. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today, the capabilities of the sensor network available to a warship surpass everything that World War II admirals could only dream of. But it all started with the most analog of computing power - people, pencils, paper and sweat.</font></font></div>
