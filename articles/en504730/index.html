<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Almost anyone can open their store on Amazon.com and sell just about anything. Ask, for example, lovers of digging in the trash. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These are some of the most dedicated sellers on Amazon. They rummage in what other people throw out, including directly garbage bins, clean the things found there and sell them on the Amazon platform. Many document the process of such a video hunt and share it on YouTube. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These people avoid publicity. Many of those whom WSJ tried to contact refused to share details about their sales, said that they had stopped doing this, or no longer put them up for sale as "new" ones, did not respond to requests, or unexpectedly stopped communicating. Some said they were afraid that Amazon would close their stores.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, we decided to independently verify these statements. Our reporters went to rummage around in several New Jersey cities and took out dozens of discarded items, including a stencil, scrapbooking paper, and an unopened jar of Trader Joe's lemon paste. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then we opened a store on Amazon to find out if we can put some of our products as new. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It turned out that this is pretty easy to do. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/_9/3p/qd_93pzqwqjsumjp5dzxqow6sok.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We got this lemon paste from the trash can near the Trader Joe's store.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When we revealed the existence of our store last month, an Amazon spokesman said store rules do not prohibit the direct sale of garbage products. The rules require that most of the goods be new, and note that sellers can offer used books, electronics, etc. if they mark their condition accordingly. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúSellers are responsible for meeting Amazon‚Äôs high standard for product quality,‚Äù a company spokeswoman told us. She said that our examples of stores with goods collected from the trash are ‚Äúrare exceptions.‚Äù And she added: ‚ÄúWe are investigating these cases and will take appropriate measures against unscrupulous sellers.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
She refused to comment on our store.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Amazon reported last week that it had updated its rules and explicitly prohibited the sale of items found in garbage, adding to the list of items unacceptable for sale ‚Äúitems intended to be destroyed or eliminated or otherwise marked as unsuitable for sale by the manufacturer, supplier or seller‚Äù .</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Control problem</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Amazon's control over third-party stores, uniting customers with millions of sellers from around the world, is limited. The company says it‚Äôs not responsible for what they sell, and in the courts explains that it‚Äôs not Amazon itself that sells products specified by third parties. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúYou have an internal saying: we will accept any product unless it is on fire,‚Äù said James Thomson, who helped develop the Fulfillment By Amazon code of practice for Amazon to deliver third-party goods before leaving the company in 2013. He is currently advising brands with their own Amazon account. From his point of view, "in fact, consumers themselves are involved in tracking order on the platform."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An Amazon spokeswoman said Thomson‚Äôs allegations are ‚Äúclearly false.‚Äù Thomson said he was not going to give them up. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Wade Coggins from Beaverton, Oregon, said he was looking for products to sell on Amazon in sales departments, abandoned warehouses, and in trash bins. He says he used boxes and packing tape found in the garbage to pack his orders. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He said that in such cases it is necessary to remove stains, and added that some people wrap the goods with vacuum film to make them look better. ‚ÄúIf you sell junk on Amazon,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit needs to look brand new.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Coggins showed us one store on Amazon and said that he has one more that he did not want to show us. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was unable to find signs of a second store. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To sell products at Amazon Prime, a subscription that offers fast and free shipping, third-party sellers ship items to Amazon's warehouse, where the company itself deals with packaging, delivery, and return. Amazon logos are often visible on boxes and labels. Sellers themselves can directly send goods to customers, from home or from a warehouse, and participate in the Prime program if they register in the Seller Fulfilled Prime program. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jesse Durphy in his garage with things that, he said, he got in the trash, and now he will sell online, including and on Amazon</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A 49-year-old salesman David Gracie, reselling, among other things, new goods bought from stores and individual brands at sales, said his business partner in 2016 was engaged in mining in garbage bins in Austin, Texas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the mined were humidifiers and keyboards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Gracie store on Amazon has been selling similar items for over a year under the Amazon Prime program. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He says that since then he has not traded finds from the trash. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He said that it would be unpleasant for him to sell certain types of garbage collected - for example, food - but ‚ÄúAmazon will not ask you, 'Where did you get them?‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Have you found them in the trash? ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">'DJ Co' opens a store</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Amazon says it requires sellers to provide IDs and uses a ‚Äúsystem that analyzes hundreds of unique reference points in the data to identify potential risk,‚Äù and that the company ‚Äúproactively blocks suspicious stores.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our magazine filed an application to open a store on the Amazon platform in September, sending a scan of the driver‚Äôs license of one of the reporters and bank details. Two days later, the DJ Co store was opened. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The welcome email read: "Welcome to the Welcome to Fulfillment by Amazon program." The magazine subscribed to the program at a rate of $ 39.9 / month, and also paid for additional services, including storage.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A few days before the opening of the store, our reporters in the evening, armed with flashlights and blue latex gloves, rummaged in the garbage bins located at office outlets of stores (for example, needlework or grocery stores) in several cities of the state of New Jersey. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There was a lot of broken glass and crumpled boxes in the wet garbage in the tanks, and they smelled of rot. However, there were also several products, partly in packaging, partially stained with coffee, moldy berries or juice. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Among the obtained values ‚Äã‚Äãwere: a set of stencils, a sheet of paper for scrapbooking and lemon paste with a shelf life of up to May 2020.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We cleaned and packed these items ‚Äî a jar of pasta was wrapped in a sticky cloth and scotch tape ‚Äî and sent them to Amazon's Pennsylvania warehouse in September-October last year. We filled out all the necessary forms, entering the codes of these products, which were written next to the barcodes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Amazon did not ask about the origin of the product or its expiration date. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Soon, our garbage extraction was on the Amazon Prime logo sales page and could be bought by millions of people - including a position such as Trader Joe's Imported English Authentic Lemon Paste, 10.5 oz. For $ 12.00. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Items we found in trash cans were put up for sale and shipped to Amazon</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After another raid on garbage cans, we were able to almost completely fill out and add to the list of goods for sale pastilles we obtained for freshening our breath, sunflower seeds, marmalade, bread, fig oil, olives, a hair band and a Halloween mask. But we did not send these items to the Amazon warehouse, which was necessary to put them up for sale on the site. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To put up sunscreen lotion for sale, Amazon asked for a safety certificate. When we tried to put protein powder, dietary supplements based on pea powder and a face mask on the market ‚Äî we found all this in the trash ‚Äî Amazon requested proof of purchase. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We made a sale of these items found in the trash, but did not send them to Amazon</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Kenya Friend-Daniel, a spokeswoman for Trader Joe's, said the store does not approve the sale of its products on Amazon, and that the company throws the product away if it is not suitable for sale. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Michaels store spokeswoman Mallory Smith said: ‚ÄúWe do not approve the sale of goods from the store by third parties without permission.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ri/2w/uh/ri2wuhu4zbz6_xk0levkx2h4gks.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These items could not be put up for sale - they required safety certificates</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Broken things</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Amazon forces warehouse workers to pay attention to problematic products, and computers instruct them to conduct spot checks. Some former employees said that the daily volume of inspections can be too large, and they can‚Äôt cope with it - sometimes an employee gets to scan hundreds of items per hour. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúMost often, I simply ignored the broken items,‚Äù said Chris Grantham, who worked in several positions at Amazon‚Äôs warehouses in Ruskin, Florida, until 2017 ‚Äî including the position of quality inspector.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He said that Amazon appreciates speed over accuracy and punishes workers who do not meet productivity standards. Sometimes employees change expiration dates on products that have already expired on a computer so as not to bother with the complex process of writing them off. This method was discussed by several warehouse employees in a closed group on Facebook for Amazon employees, which our editors watched. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An Amazon spokeswoman said that workers have the authority to reject products of inappropriate quality, and that the company has ‚Äúcarried out many inspections during the inventory and product selection process to maintain quality standards.‚Äù As for the requirements for employee productivity, she said that ‚Äútheir effectiveness is measured and evaluated over long periods of time.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Jesse Durphy said that he used Amazon to sell toys, video games, electronics and all kinds of trinkets found in trash, including garbage dumps at Michaels and GameStop stores. This 26-year-old resident of Torrington, Connecticut, said that he liked most of all to search for products that could be sold on Amazon at his city dump. He said that he spreads the found things with the characteristic ‚Äúused‚Äù, and did not give us the address of his store, out of fear that other sellers might sabotage it. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb2/2f0/f3f/cb22f0f3fdd50c539a9d9a9bad67e55d.jpg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI started rummaging through the trash because I didn‚Äôt have the money to buy the product,‚Äù said Durfy.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
On a YouTube video from 2017, he tests the TV remote control, which he said was found in the trash, and tells the audience that traces of batteries in the compartment for them can be washed off with soda and water.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He says he opened a store on Amazon six years ago, when he realized that it was much more profitable to resell things than make money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI started rummaging through the trash because I didn‚Äôt have the money to buy the goods,‚Äù he said, and then added to this the purchase of goods in economy stores and on sales, which he then sells on Amazon. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúI walked around the pawn shops, I rummaged through the trash,‚Äù he said. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI am one of those who are ready for anything.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Abusive comments</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In internal forums for Amazon sellers, some of them are worried about garbage appearing on the site. One, in a post entitled "lovers of digging in the trash, filled the category of cosmetics" writes that the sale of these products of poor quality caused complaints about products that he and other sellers in this category were selling. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An Amazon spokeswoman said the seller‚Äôs opinion that this category was ‚Äúflooded‚Äù is ‚Äúwrong and unfounded.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To find out if this topic is causing concern for Amazon customers, we analyzed about 45,000 comments posted on Amazon in 2018-2019. About 8400 comments on 4300 products from the sections ‚Äúfood‚Äù, ‚Äúcosmetics‚Äù and ‚Äúmedicines without a prescription‚Äù contain keywords that indicate that the product was not sealed, it expired, it was strangely sticky or there were other problems with the product of a similar nature. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
About 544 of these 4,300 products were advertised in the Amazon's Choice section, which many customers see as a sign of quality or endorsement by the company. On the Amazon website it is written that such a mark reflects a combination of factors - rating, prices and delivery time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Among the 4,300 products we reviewed, 241 products ‚Äî including ibuprofen generic, Sun Chips, and a face lotion marked as Amazon's Choice ‚Äî had at least 5 comments from different people that said the product was used or expired shelf life. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One reviewer said that the ordered lipstick came to her without packaging, rumpled and moldy. Five said they found a fungus on their protein bars. One wrote: ‚ÄúMy daughter ate a few of them, and today she called me to the kitchen, to show that on the bar, from which she had already eaten half, MOLD !!!‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Last year, Eileen Anastassopoulos bought applesauce with grapes from one of Amazon's third-party sellers. It turned out that the expiration date of the soft mashed sachets expired seven months before. Eileen, a 39-year-old mother, left a review with a photograph, which shows that the expiration date is indicated as ‚ÄúNovember 2017‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to her, after her complaint, Amazon sent her a new order, but "if I had not been careful and checked the expiration dates, my son might have problems." We did not find her seller, but we found another seller of the same puree, with reviews, judging by which, he is selling damaged goods with an expired shelf life.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An Amazon spokeswoman said the company is looking at consumer reviews and taking action as necessary. She commented on our findings as follows: "the number of reviews that indicate problems with the quality of the goods is less than 0.01% of the total number of reviews for this product." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to her, Amazon uses ‚Äúa combination of AI and manual checks to track product quality and security issues in the store,‚Äù and that if the product does not fit the recommendations, Amazon ‚Äúwill take the necessary measures against the seller, including, possibly, deleting his account records. "</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Amazon customers are not always completely free to choose from whom they buy the product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By default, the so-called. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúMixing‚Äù - when a client thinks that he is buying from one seller, but in the end the goods come from another. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This can happen when the product arrived at a warehouse located closer to the customer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The representative said that such a process "allows Amazon to efficiently process, execute, and deliver orders."</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Refunds on sale</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Third-party stores of one of the types that can be found on Amazon buy their assortment from liquidation companies - these are large boxes the size of a bathtub, filled with goods seized from the warehouses or shelves of large retail stores, as well as goods returned after purchase. Often such goods are scattered around in a box, and no one checks them. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d3/388/2ae/3d33882aee75ed50e9fd7987329f34c8.jpg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Heather Hooks, 40, buys boxes from liquidation companies and resells them to Amazon</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Heather Hooks, 40, said she had already sold thousands of products to Amazon on liquidators such as Lego sets, Tylenol tablets, Hanes underwear, and Maybelline cosmetics. According to her estimates, approximately 75% of the goods that she buys do not have any problems, and she sells such goods as new. She sells the rest through eBay and other sites, honestly noting their status. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sellers say that on eBay, restrictions on which product is considered ‚Äúsecond-hand‚Äù are less stringent. An eBay spokesman said the site requires sellers to accurately describe things, including whether they were in use or if they were damaged.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Hooks, who lives near St. Louis, said she earns more than $ 20,000 a year by selling products on Amazon this way and posting a business blog on her on YouTube. On the page of her personal store there are hundreds of goods - toys, sweets, toiletries, cosmetics and clothes. About three years ago, Amazon temporarily froze its sales, as one of the brands complained that it sold their products, not being an authorized seller. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ef/ea6/f4c/7efea6f4cccf64543bd834d2fb84c8c1.jpg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm very meticulously approaching this issue,‚Äù she said, saying that she was studying each product for package integrity and all components. ‚ÄúEven if there is a small dent in it, I will not sell it anymore.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Regarding digging in the trash, she said that ‚Äúthis is not mine,‚Äù but that ‚Äúsome people consider the purchase of liquidation goods to be something like this.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a closed forum for Amazon sellers, one of them complained that Amazon itself was reselling the returned goods. This seller earns on earrings, and in May 2018 wrote a post stating that Amazon sometimes repackages goods returned by customers and returns to warehouse shelves, if approved by its employees. The seller wrote that he asked Amazon to stop reselling the returned earrings, but in response he was told that since the company checks all returned items, there is nothing wrong with that.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúI hope one day I‚Äôll stop panicking,‚Äù the seller wrote, ‚Äúevery time a couple of earrings are returned to me that Amazon sends them to someone else, along with unhygienic diseases in the kit.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An Amazon spokeswoman said the company carefully checks all returns "and all items that fall back on shelves under the guise of new ones meet the same high standards as goods received directly from the manufacturer." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some sellers say they buy rejections rejected on Amazon from the liquidators, and then sell them again on Amazon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Amazon says it works with liquidators, and that items that satisfy their rules can be sold again on Amazon.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lemon paste</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The three products we found in the garbage dump, put up for sale through Amazon in the DJ Co store, we immediately bought ourselves - so that no one else would. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0d/153/21c/e0d15321c31860c4e328a05235fc1a04.jpg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone came to us with the return address of the Kentucky Amazon warehouse. Someone bent a set of stencils. The paper reached without a problem. They arrived in packaging from Amazon, and not in the one in which we sent them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Lemon paste came in the same packaging that we used when sending and we, in an untouched bumble and adhesive tape. Amazon just stuck their own sticker on top of ours. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
DJ Co store remained open until last week, however, without any goods.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Amazon said on Friday that it had updated the rules to prohibit the sale of items found in garbage. A store spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúGarbage collection has never met Amazon‚Äôs high expectations from sellers, and is prohibited by the store‚Äôs code of seller behavior. The code requires honest and fair work from sellers. We updated our rules to more explicitly prohibit such behavior. ‚Äù When asked about how Amazon was going to force people to follow this rule, the spokeswoman said the store has stepped up efforts to confirm the origin of goods, including increasing random checks on origin documents. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On Saturday, we received an email from Amazon:</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúYour account has been closed due to violation of seller‚Äôs rules and code of conduct. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We learned that your products were obtained by you in a manner that did not meet the high requirements of the store, designed to maintain the trust and safety of Amazon customers. ‚Äù</font></font></div>
