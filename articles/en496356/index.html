<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, our Engineering and Technology School No. 777, St. Petersburg, belongs to such buildings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We faced such a problem that when guests and parents visit our school, it is difficult for them to find the right office or other necessary place. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone finds their way out of this situation, someone endlessly asks building workers, and someone just wanders through endless corridors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having analyzed this problem, we decided to make a navigator for our visitors for our school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But a simple navigator with a map inside the building is not relevant, which cannot be said about one of the new and rapidly developing technologies of augmented reality (AR). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our navigator was developed with AR technology, computer vision and machine learning methods. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will help you navigate and find the exact place where visitors to our school should go.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">purpose </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The goal is to create a universal assistant in building orientation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Main goals:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To simplify the orientation of the school of new students, parents and guests; </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make the application universal so that later it supports navigation not only in our school, but also in any other buildings around the world; </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">User-friendly interface, understandable to everyone; </font></font></li>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AR - Augmented Reality </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now every year more and more new technologies appear, one of such augmented reality technology or just AR. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, his very first acquaintance, happened when the well-known company Google decided to make his glasses with augmented reality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then AR technology began to develop incredibly fast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Google abandoned their Google glass project, a new era of masks came in that recognized our face and turned it into celebrities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the Pok√©mon captured both realities and people traveled kilometers in search of the coolest character. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
More recently, Google and Apple introduced their ARC engines, ARCore and ARKit, respectively, from which we can conclude that AR technology will become even more accessible for the development and creation of more and more new applications and games.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is AR? </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Augmented reality is an environment that in real time complements the real world, as we see it with the help of digital data processed using any electronic computing devices and software. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, augmented reality (AR) must be distinguished from virtual (virtual reality, VR) and mixed (mixed reality, MR).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are their main differences? </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In AR, virtual digital objects are projected onto a real environment, unlike virtual reality. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Virtual reality is a world created by digital technical means, transmitted to a person through the senses. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mixed reality is a cross between VR and AR and combines both approaches. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
VR creates its own world, where a person plunges, and augmented reality works with the real physical world, introducing virtual objects into it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It follows that VR interacts exclusively with users, while AR interacts with the outside world.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Development prospects </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
AR technology may occupy the niche that science fiction has devoted to holograms. Only holograms will not be soon, and devices like Hololens (Microsoft Augmented Reality Glasses) are technically ready. The prospect of seeing virtual interactive illustrations in schools, which can be viewed from all sides, with which you can interact and immediately see the result of your experiences, seems far from beautiful bright fantasies about the future. Training in any engineering specialties can become much more visual and easy to understand, as well as interesting. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 To summarize, the additional reality is not only games and cool masks for social networks. This is a huge number of opportunities in the use of AR in the fields of education, industry and medicine.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The growth of augmented reality is astounding. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unlike VR, she does not need to rely on massive helmets and powerful hardware, just the most compact and mobile device of our time - a smartphone. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Augmented reality is already changing our present: virtual masks, hunting for Pokemon in the cities and swamps, children shooting at each other not from pieces of wood, but through the phone screen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now it is already a reality.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Work planning </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our navigator has a cabinet number recognition system, this recognition works using machine learning methods, and specifically, convolutional neural network technology was used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's dive into architecture. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For this model, we had to solve 2 main problems:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">detecting letters in the image; </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">recognition of letters.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If for recognizing letters there are old - good LeNet-like networks, then for detecting letters in the picture we had to write our neural network architecture, compile a database and train the model. In order to compose the architecture, we needed to understand what kind of machine learning problem our model would solve.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After much debate, we came to a consensus - the text detector should solve the regression problem, i.e. the model should predict where the letter is potentially located. Then we simulated a neural network consisting of two layers, not including the input and output layers, but then we faced a problem: there was a lot of output data, because of this we had a problem - the problem of retraining, and we came to the conclusion that we we need a different architecture and approach to the problem, after a long discussion we came to the conclusion that we need to detect not letters at once, but first words, and only then letters. And here we spent quite a lot of time changing the database and then added another neural network to the cascade, because of this our coefficient (we chose the Mean Squared Error metric) decreased by 40%, but still the actual result was far from the desired one,therefore, we decided to rewrite the architecture of 2 neural networks for this we had to disassemble the ‚Äúensemble‚Äù and understand how each network works separately and understand why we need each parameter for each network. Then we realized that instead of reducing the number of parameters, we can change the approach to the problem, and our team changed the model: now this is one convolutional neural network, with this approach, we reduced the error rate by 30% and the speed of run through the network increased.now this is one convolutional neural network, with this approach we have reduced the error rate by 30% and the speed of run through the network has increased.now this is one convolutional neural network, with this approach we have reduced the error rate by 30% and the speed of run through the network has increased.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The problem of character detection is solved, it remains to solve the problem of character recognition, character recognition itself was not a new task for our team, we trained a convolutional neural network that was similar in architecture to the LeNet neural network and received a 99% error coefficient on the test dataset (i.e., a neural network almost no mistake). But in practice, this turned out to be an unacceptable solution, since a fixed-resolution picture should go to the input of this network, but in practice, different pictures with different resolutions can come in, and then our team thought about it and decided to train the same neural network, but only in pictures with enough a large resolution, so large that it could be accurately assumed that there would be no greater permission to enter the neural network,but then we abandoned this idea because we are trying to change the resolution of the image supplied to the input of the architecture which does not imply a change in image resolution, so now we need to think about the architecture of recognizing letters, and we realized that the best solution was to take as a basis architecture - a descendant of the LeNet neural network - ResNet from Microsoft, this architecture implies that it will receive images with different resolutions.that it will receive images with different resolutions.that it will receive images with different resolutions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, after we trained the neural network, the error rate for us became 95% - yes, it‚Äôs a little less than with the LeNet architecture but it works, then we remembered that we did not need to recognize all the letters, but only the numbers and decided to add before determining symbol is another model that will determine whether the symbol to be determined is a number or a letter, since this model solves the classification problem and classifies only 2 classes, the neural network was meaningless and therefore we took the logistic regression as the basis of architecture, after adding this model to ‚ÄúEnsemble‚Äù and retraining of the neural network (only by numbers), our error rate was + - 97% which is not very bad, on this ‚Äúnote‚Äù we decided to finish work on character recognition and, as a result, we got such an ‚Äúensemble‚Äù:</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Original picture -&gt; Convolutional neural network that determines the location of words -&gt; Convolutional neural network that determines the location of letters -&gt; Logistic regression, which determines the letter in the picture or number -&gt; ResNet, which determines the final digit</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But then we had one more problem: the problem with tracking geolocation. At first we thought that this was one of the easiest tasks and turned out to be wrong. First of all, we, like real programmers, took the path of least resistance and simply tracked the GPS geolocation at the object - it didn‚Äôt work, the error was so big that it didn‚Äôt suit us at all, we decided to think about other options for determining geolocation and decided to connect the service from the company Yandex - Yandex Latitude, but it turned out to be not working, i.e. it‚Äôs not a working service in which you can‚Äôt connect the API, our next thought was to connect the mapbox framework for the Unity engine (it was on it that we decided to develop our project), after we successfully connected this framework, examined its capabilities and wrote a simple GPS tracker - the result was already betterbut the error was still large, because of this we continued to search for solutions, and after a careful reading of the documentation, we found that the obtained value had an error of 15%, this did not suit us, especially since this approach had a very big drawback - it used GPS , and we are making a navigator around the school, it means indoors, then the GPS signal will either be very weak or not at all + GPS is not supported on all devices, which is why we changed the approach and moved from global recognition to local based on Visual Positioning System This method also has its drawbacks, but they did not affect our work in any way, so the geolocation tracking system was ready.that there is an error of 15% for the obtained value, this did not suit us, especially since this approach had a very big drawback - it used GPS, and we do the navigator around the school, then indoors, then the GPS signal will either be very weak or will not In general, + GPS is not supported on all devices, which is why we changed the approach and moved from global recognition to local based on the Visual Positioning System.

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Practical significance </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our application serves to better orient people who have come for the first time or who simply have a poor understanding of the structure of the school of people in our educational institution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They will come and meet at the entrance a stand with a QR code, when reading which the application is downloaded.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Functional</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What our application can do: </font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">recognize the cabinet number by the plate, </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">detailed school map, </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">lead a person to his office, </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">search for an office by its number, </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">search for the classroom in the list and by its type (all classrooms are distributed in certain groups depending on what subject is taught in this room). </font></font></li>
</ul><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Application implementation </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The application was written on one of the most popular engines called ‚ÄúUnity‚Äù, using the C # programming language, as well as using Python and the TensorFlow library, besides all of the above, the Anaconda package manager was used. </font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to use this application? </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose I am a parent and came to a parent's meeting, I need to get into room 339, an informatics office. I went to school and must scan, as I repeat the QR code from the tablet. Then, after successfully loading the application, I will get to the main menu: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://sun9-10.userapi.com/Lpp-cfOFtIXNfhTlQnElbwasUKvul0T40Xk37g/_3-Zn9uiyWw.jpg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After that, I can go to the instructions menu to find out how to use the application: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://sun9-2.userapi.com/8_eDNMwyk_Vh_cLJ4BLX0rutFdqkwLNeWe5UlA/N2wPLhcJIko.jpg" alt="image"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This instruction describes in detail how to find the class, i.e. first, in the main menu, we click ‚ÄúFind Class‚Äù, then the following menus are displayed: The </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://sun9-55.userapi.com/c6c4IOqRQ1R16nvWmn7RFO727TSVIT4ZRY6IvA/W4g5rpFDJXs.jpg" alt="image"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
arrow in the upper right corner allows us to go back to the main menu, if the system recognized the cabinet number, a frame appears around the plate, and then a confirmation window:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://sun9-72.userapi.com/nH012VpsKk-S_v2RM9BCeHsSPuIQNPVoqaePHQ/ZqMM8diWRuI.jpg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the model correctly recognized the cabinet, then our conditional ‚Äúparent‚Äù will click ‚Äúyes‚Äù, if the cabinet number is not recognized correctly, then click ‚Äúno‚Äù and take the picture again. So the application will understand where we are in the school space. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Next, the ‚Äúparent‚Äù must choose a destination and here he has 2 options, either enter the number of the office, or select its type and find it in the list later: </font></font><br>
<br>

 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After that, the ‚Äúparent‚Äù must follow the signs on the camera. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When you arrive at your destination, the navigator will notify you of this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is another option, more familiar, the ‚Äúparent‚Äù clicks on the main menu - ‚ÄúSchool Plan‚Äù and a detailed plan opens, where you can independently navigate how to get to the desired place. </font></font><br>
