      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/499054/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not so long ago, I was invited to a CTO position in a cool grocery startup and I decided to restart my career. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After several years of work in a large and stable company, I realized that it would not be easy, I will have a million small and big tasks, at first I will have to hard-wrap and build almost everything from scratch. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this article I want to talk about how I was preparing to move to a new position and what I did the first time in a new company. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The instruction is written in a general style and is suitable for a manager of almost any level when changing jobs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Go!</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Training</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This item is one of the most important: have a clear plan of action. You should not think that planning is pointless until you get a job in a new company. Do not hope to decide what, when and how to do. The work load will be such that you will move under the pressure of circumstances, believing that this is your plan, forgetting what you really wanted to do. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Your goals in your new position and action plans must be set before you are appointed. Such a plan will help you successfully complete the initial period, after which you can begin to implement your big plans.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I managed to draw up this plan in about 3 weeks, while I was finishing work at my previous job. To do this, I had to read all my notes from books, bookmarks and selected management materials. I also read several books on the subject and came across a very useful book: Michael Watkins ‚ÄúThe First 90 Days. Success strategies for new leaders of all levels ‚Äù, I recommend reading! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is desirable to have a plan written on paper. This document should always be at hand, maintained up to date, and it should be constantly brought into line with your understanding of the situation, through systematic monitoring of execution and adjustment of the results. For example, I reviewed the plan every week, marked the completed points in green, added something, removed something.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before you get to work, collect as much information as possible about your future employees - ask HR, your immediate supervisor, look at profiles on social networks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Try to meet with your future employees to understand who they are, how to build relationships with them, etc. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Be sure to coordinate your processing with your family - at first just a colossal amount of information and business will fall on you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important that there are people who support you, understand your employment and, possibly, take on some of your household responsibilities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My family gave me 3 months to settle things in a new place, I sent work from 8 to 20 and supported me in every possible way.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Get to know the team</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, your first working day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your task is to get to know everyone. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the first meeting, your task is to make a good impression on your future employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tell us about yourself, your experience and plans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is appropriate to say that your goal is not to break and rebuild, but to develop and improve processes with the active participation and in the interests of the employees themselves. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It should be noted that in the near future you will get into the course of affairs and meet with each employee (options: with each group of employees, with department heads - depending on the size of the team). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I met with each employee, there were 16 then: first with managers and key employees. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Put down pizza, juices and waters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This will help to know the team in an informal setting.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Discuss with your supervisor your responsibilities</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Contact your supervisor (the CEO or the owner - in my case both). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Examples of questions:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are your immediate goals as a new leader (for example: find 10 new employees, release a new product by March 1)</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the goal of your department / company (for example: to double sales by the end of the year)</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What reports should be provided: format (document, presentation, oral report at the meeting), how often (daily, weekly, monthly), what should be inside (numbers, graphs, etc.)</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a conversation with the leader, you need to clearly talk about expectations, so your task is to understand and discuss the expectations of management. What does the boss want you to do first, and what second? What will be considered success? How will your performance be evaluated? How long does it take? You can come to the conclusion that the leader‚Äôs expectations are unrealistic and you need to try to change them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You should definitely talk about how you interact on an ongoing basis. What form of communication does he prefer? Personal conversation, written report, email? How often? On what issues you should definitely consult with him, and on which you are free to make independent decisions? How do your interaction styles differ? How can this affect your interaction?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Discuss the necessary resources. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do you need to succeed? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What should your supervisor do? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resources are not limited to funding and staff. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you come to the company at the time of the reorganization, for example, you may need the manager personally to convince your subordinates of the need for change.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gather information inside the team</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Communicate more with the team, meet your colleagues. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Find out how things are and where bottlenecks are at work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make a list of questions and meet with each employee. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the meeting itself, give the floor to the interlocutor, make notes for yourself during communication, so as not to forget anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Examples of questions:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do you like about your work?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do you dislike about your work?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What result of your work over the past six months are you proud of?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is stopping you from doing your job?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What problems do you see?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What needs to be changed in the work of the department in the very near future?</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any comments (what pleases, what infuriates, what mood, what you expect from work, etc.)</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main goal is to identify weaknesses in the department. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I guarantee that you will make several discoveries. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second most important goal is to identify the good that is now in the department. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Understand what keeps employees in the field and what motivates them.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not criticize or break.</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First carefully study how everything works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only change what the early changes objectively ripened, and be sure to explain to the team why and why you are changing it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Maintain and develop further what already gives good results. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first, refrain from changes for the sake of experimentation or in order to show what you are capable of, otherwise you will get the opposite effect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not break what works well, you will cause a big negative for the team - because they also took an active part in creating the existing system. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To improve relations, you need to show your openness, dedication and willingness to dialogue - then employees will reciprocate.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not rush to act, as you are used to at your previous place of work</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many managers are trying to recreate the conditions of their previous work in a new place. And this is a big mistake! The companies, the people in them, the market conditions and much more are very different. In one company with the same introductory, you will succeed, in another - failure. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is necessary to abandon the past and focus on requirements that meet the new situation. It is difficult to do, but necessary. Too often, promising leaders go on increasing, but do not cope with the responsibility imposed on them, because they are unable to move to a new level of thinking, completely change their vision of the situation. It is a mistake to assume that you will succeed in a new position if you continue to do the same as before, but only to a larger extent.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The most destructive situation is when a new leader comes to the organization with a ‚Äúready answer‚Äù. He has already decided for himself how to solve problems, because he ‚Äúgrew up‚Äù in an organization where ‚Äúeverything was done as it should‚Äù and cannot understand: what was good for one organizational culture may not at all take root in another. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is also about approaches and methods of communication that are simply familiar to the leader. Also about hiring his former colleagues - not because they are better than current assistants, but because he is also just humanly used to them. Needless to say, the replacement of key employees in a new place with ‚Äúyour own people‚Äù causes a particular displeasure of the team?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even if you decide to bring old colleagues into a new company, evaluate whether they will fit into the new team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou should not do this right away: first look at the company and its corporate culture. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are situations when it‚Äôs really better to focus on developing an existing team. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Win the first victories, help the team</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You need to win at an early stage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be anything:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">solve the problems of your subordinate, which no one could solve (buy a second monitor, write instructions, solve the problem with a trip to the conference, etc.)</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">reduce the number of meetings if at the moment there are too many or are ineffective;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suggest workflow optimization that really helps your new employees.</font></font></li>
</ul><br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Build relationships with your manager</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order for the relationship with your leader to develop successfully, you need to discuss intermediate statuses and successes achieved. This is important for him to understand that you are an independent and responsible person, you don‚Äôt need to climb and impose the rules ‚Äúhow to do the work‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If there is a serious difference in work styles between you and your manager, it is best to discuss this directly. Otherwise, there is a risk that he interprets this difference as incompetence. Talk about how you best combine your work styles. Thanks to this conversation, it will be easier for each of you to achieve your goals.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One proven strategy is to discuss goals and outcomes, rather than how you intend to achieve them. You can simply say that, most likely, there will be some difference in your approaches to certain issues and decisions, but you commit yourself to achieve the results that you agreed on. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many new leaders play according to the rules proposed to them, taking the situation for granted, and as a result lose. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Also, do not expect your manager to contact you or offer the necessary support. It is best to accept from the very beginning as a fact that establishing a relationship falls on your shoulders.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Find out expectations from the very beginning, do it all over again and again. Ask your supervisor for feedback on your work. Do not deceive the expectations of your leadership. You will have big trouble if he expects that you will quickly fix everything, and you know that the business is experiencing serious structural problems. It would be a wise decision to immediately announce bad news and underestimate unrealistic expectations. Do not allow yourself to rush to extinguish a fire immediately or put forward tasks when you are not ready for it yet. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Aim for first results in areas that matter to your leader. What are his interests, goals, how do your actions fit into the big picture? As soon as you find out, aim for the first results in these areas.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Earn good praise from those whose opinion your leader respects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His opinion about you will be formed partly due to personal communication, partly under the influence of what he hears about you from those whom he trusts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He may have a certain relationship with some of your subordinates. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, in no case do you need to curry favor with them, you just have to do your job at the first-class level!</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Work, work hard, do your best</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are no comments, and so everything is clear.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read, write, store</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Your boss will be interested in how things are going, and you yourself too. Working in a managerial position will put your memory to severe trials, even if you are sure that it did not fail you before. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Verbal agreement is often not enough. Even if you talked with someone and agreed exactly, and both remember exactly what they agreed on, send meeting minutes anyway. Be consistent with this technique especially when talking to superiors. We talked, realized - MM. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sooner or later they will require reporting from you - think about which numbers serve as indicators of your work, with the help of which indicators you can see problems in the department. Start collecting these numbers, even if no one requires you to. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Spare a few hours on automation to save yourself days.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For you, these numbers will also be very useful for understanding how efficiently you work, whether you are doing the right things, how correctly you are doing it, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A few graphs and numbers from my diary for the first month of my work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here I will not cite the conclusions that I have drawn on the graphs, they are only for me. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
1. Net hours worked for each day in the first month of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To get just working time, you need to add ~ 2 hours to each digit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Friday of each week additionally sums up weekends. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
2. Distribution of time by work activities. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I hope my experience and thoughts are useful to someone. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dream, change work and the world around you!</font></font></div>
