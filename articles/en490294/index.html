      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/490294/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, we collect the stories of the most bizarre interviews, hires and companies where you have been. I was usually lucky somehow, I didn’t see very large deviations from the norm. Well, there was a polygraph, I had to send an interviewer, once even arranged a reverse interview - the IT head, having recognized my salary in the current place, wanted to work for me, even a simple programmer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the most outstanding case occurred a few years ago, when there were so many impressions of the first day of work that by the evening I had slept with a high temperature, despite the fine May weather outside.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, for political reasons (they offended me, what is already there), I quit my job as the head of the IT agricultural holding (chicken, pigs, sausage, barbecue, etc.). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A similar employer responded to the resume - they also make sausages and raise pigs, only without chicken. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems that everything is one to one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, a friend worked at this enterprise. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I tinkled at him, found out - he answered rather succinctly that everything was fine, work as work.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First interview</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first interview consisted of two phases, nothing unusual. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first, a nice HR-girl (just like she was written out of the catalog) sat and pretended to be interested in the difficulties of finding out the cost structure of multiple production processes in order to determine the change in the share of electricity in the cost of selling sausages. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then the head of the IT factory almost did not listen and did not ask. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He found out where I worked, was delighted, and said - I take you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">OK. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I went, quit, and drove to their village.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First call</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, the fact that before work sawing an hour on the highway is a familiar thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pig farms are not being built within the city limits, the smell is unbreakable, especially if there is also a smoking shop on the territory. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The division of the amount of income into black and white was a bit annoying - the official salary was only 12 tr. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the first interview, we discussed only the full income, they were not the same years in the yard to get so small - it never occurred to me to ask about this in advance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Okay, I thought, we’ll survive, I was already a happy owner of a mortgage.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bulging eyes</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then the IT chief led me to the director. Oh, it's a Character. I have never seen such, either before or after. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Usually directors are quite adequate people. Yes, companies have a “mission,” “values,” “strategy,” and “goals.” And relate to them ... In general, "relate." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this - just like a chain broke. We, said, gathered here in order to supply the whole country with sausage. And does not smile. This, says our mission. And again she does not smile. Only bulging eyes, as if trying to convince me with all my heart.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then he drove in general. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on, he says, from our high mission (well, the country is waiting for sausages), any employee should forget about his personal life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I’ll try to quote ... “Even if you are a drunk, even with a prostitute, even if you are naked in the bathhouse, you always have a telephone with you, and on the first call, you drop everything and arrive to repair it.” </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, it was necessary to physically fly in - the udalenka was forbidden. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More precisely, it had to be earned, and not before IT, but before the security service. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Okay, I thought, I’m unlikely to see this guy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let him continue to supply the country with sausage, but I will go programming.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Business user</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The only business user that I and the chief of IT managed to visit is the chief accountant. An interesting lady, took out a cigarette, lit a cigarette, and began to talk about the difficulties of calculating cost. The head of IT also lit a cigarette and, for some reason, began to divert the conversation towards the taste characteristics of sausages. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He quickly succeeded, and the lady happily forgot about the calculation of cost. I decided not to participate in their smoke break, and for a while I was silent. But, because at that moment he was fond of calculating the cost of production of the dead from the living, he still returned to this topic.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The conversation turned out to be strange. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The chief accountant says that it is difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mention some difficulties. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The IT chief assented her wholeheartedly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I say that everything is simple - well, I’m not just scratching it; I literally a week ago solved exactly the same problem in a similar, only more complex enterprise. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The chief accountant listens to me, and glances at the chief of IT. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He is a little embarrassed, and says that, already working here, he ate the sausage of another factory, for which he is still a little ashamed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And without letting me finish, he says “well, we have to go!”, Takes me by the arm and takes me out of the office.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Excursion</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Deciding, apparently, to get rid of me so far, the IT director sends me on a tour of the enterprise, accompanied by a programmer - the same one, my friend. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At first, nothing remarkable happens. We go, we look. I remembered only the car, pumping liquid into the meat. They used to tell me that this is to increase the weight of a product for nothing. Then I heard the version that this is for a better salting. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Gradually, I begin to notice a huge number of weights, all kinds of brands and sizes. The rooms (namely the rooms, not the workshops) in the production are small, and for each, at least, a pair of scales - at the entrance and exit.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I ask - why so many, and why at the door, and not at the equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He says this is called controlling. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They take out products from the room - weigh them, record them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We crossed the threshold - again on the scales, weighed, recorded. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And what, I say, do it if the weight is different? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don’t know, the programmer says. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then, for some reason, he brought me to the slaughterhouse. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actually, I come from a village, and I saw how they get meat. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But he has never been to an industrial slaughter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I will not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And still I don’t understand why he brought me there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why did I need to see a huge, amazingly clean room, a lone pig and a pool of blood. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Further excursion - like in a fog.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My tasks</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After the tour, the IT chief was already waiting for me. Judging by the look, he got a little cold, invited me to his office to discuss the tasks that he wants to entrust me with. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I took this opportunity to ask if there were so many weights. His eyes flashed immediately, and he proudly said that the company is very fond of "controlling". True, their understanding of controlling is different from what is accepted around the world. Their controlling is to constantly weigh everything.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not only are there scales everywhere - there is still a “Controlling Department”, about 40 (!) Girls who are only engaged in running and “controlling” the weighing. Those. workers, movers, drivers weigh, and girls check them. No, they control - they are not the verification department, but the controlling department. Without this, a country cannot be provided with sausage. It’s good that there are more weights than girls. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Moved to the tasks. I look forward in joyful expectation that they will entrust me with a difficult and interesting task - costing. But it was not there. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Remember, I asked the programmer what would happen if the readings of the scales diverged? This problem was given to me by the head of IT. He says sometimes the scales diverge. And what to do, no one knows. And I need to figure out what to do about it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Being a measuring engineer by training, I began to tell that this is not a task of automation, but metrology and stat. analysis, because comparing the results of different measuring instruments with different errors does not require automation - you just need to formulate simple rules, or make a plate of permissible deviations for each pair of scales. Or, if you look a little higher, rearrange the scales in places so that the same models stand nearby. Or, if you completely step aside, then fuck so much weighed? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then he was directly upset - apparently, for a quick touch. The lively thing was that this IT department was implementing the project. In terms of weights, I bought them and set them up everywhere. Instead of calculating the cost. And now these scales and, most importantly, the problems of their operation are the bread of the IT department.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, I say, litter, but I do not want to deal with such nonsense. I say, dude, a week ago I was in a position similar to yours, only in a company of a larger size, turnover and profitability. It is necessary to do real things, and not to accompany someone’s sick imagination (didn’t the IT department come up with the idea of ​​putting scales everywhere?). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He was even more offended. He began to suspect that I was trying to get into his place on the very first day. I explain: you are this, they will soon come to you for the cost price and normal consideration, you will not put in kilograms instead of rubles from your scales.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, he freaked out even, started asking where I got the crown on my head. I think - but why, after a hefty puddle of blood, there’s nothing to lose anymore, and somehow kind of honestly told him that he was an ordinary half-fool who thinks he has saddled a topic and will sit on it all his life. And life is a little more complicated, it is necessary to outstrip demand. And your customers are not just guys with bulging eyes. And those with bulging eyes are just hired personnel who will change tomorrow, and a sane guy will come and ask for numbers. Or maybe ask where the numbers are. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Just in case, he told how the director loved numbers from his previous work. And I judged the work of the IT department only by the timely receipt of numbers and the work of Wi-Fi (by the way, I got burnt on Wi-Fi). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The IT director was very upset, and said that he would think. And I went to work.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The wonders of development</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I came, sat down, I think - I’ll take a look at what they have here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I ask - let the food look. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Code, metadata, improvements, data, reports. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, understand what they are using, how, in what condition the accounting is. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They say it’s impossible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don’t understand, I ask again - what is impossible? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the food, they say, it’s impossible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forbidden by the security service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Programmers are prohibited in the prod. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
OK, I smile and ask - what about a copy? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pf, and you can’t copy it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And there is no copy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is impossible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prohibited. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Damn, I say, and where is your base for testing development? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let with not very relevant data, a month ago there, but at least one year old. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is impossible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prohibited.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And how to work? And so. Create a local database for yourself. From the source, but without data. And drive the data yourself sit - the nomenclature there, units, issues, arrivals, prices, etc. You will test on this data. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I stopped wondering how Alice was in the Looking Glass. Just for fun, I asked how they reproduce errors - well, when a user does something in a specific context, and he has an error. Well, and reproduce, they say. According to the verbal description. Context. And then a mistake. If you're lucky.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, the user will say that the wrong price is being tightened in the parish. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, there is that price, but there is not that price. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are at least two of them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in my test base - not a single one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And there is no such nomenclature. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the counterparty too. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And accounting policies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the settings for filling in prices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is only a description of the context - "when you buy corrugated packaging, the wrong price rises." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Scales are far from the most interesting, as it turned out.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stuffing</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I sit, deploy the base, look at the source. At least I pretend. I myself am writing a letter to people who refused to continue communicating on employment a couple of days ago. I liked the first meeting with them, and it seems to them, too, but then they gave out - you need to go through a polygraph. I had no such experience before, I was afraid that they were somehow strange, and refused. Now the polygraph was not scary. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then some dude rushes into the IT office and says: hey, defective meat, go eat! At first I thought - a local comedian. I looked closely - no, in my hand something like a ham, or carbonade, in a vacuum package. Explains - defective packaging, and the meat is normal, you can gobble up. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think - well, right now the programmers will say "thank you, put it on the table, then we'll eat it." Yeah.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone was blown up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They did not get up, but were blown up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost the chairs didn’t fall. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They attacked, torn the packaging, torn to pieces with their hands and gobbled up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No knives, no forks, no plates. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I did not even have time to be surprised. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or could not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not know. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wrote a letter.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conversation</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I could not stand it, and sat down with a familiar programmer. He began to ask what the hell. He offered to go out for a smoke. Moreover, just the lunch break began. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Knowing that he does not smoke, I realized that everything is not so simple. When we confidently walked past the smoking room to the exit from the enterprise, it became even more interesting. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They went beyond the territory, moved a kilometer away. Then he stopped and said that the security service was listening to all conversations in the territory - both telephones and ordinary verbal communication. I was surprised and did not believe - how can a village security service listen to my phone that is not connected to their corporate tariff? Even the mobile operator is different. The programmer said he could. I still don’t know if I lied or not.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, since there’s such a conversation, I ask - what’s the office so dumb? Yes, she’s a moron. Which have. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why, I ask, is the head of IT only concerned with his weights? Because someone from the authorities is worried so that they do not steal. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I ask, they steal? No, they do not steal. But the authorities are still worried. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I remembered a story from a previous job. The system administrators climbed into the attic of the building of the smokehouse to stretch the stp cable there. And they discovered a mountain of chicken bones. Local workers, from a neighboring village, gradually stole smoked chicken wings, dragged into the attic and ate. They just dragged and ate. So, I remembered. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I asked about strange prohibitions for programmers - well, yes, strange. But you can live. He does not know the reason.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I asked about the salary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, yes, she says, official little. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well now. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Doesn’t bother, I say, to engage in any nonsense? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You are a programmer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not, he says, fine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'm used to it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like even. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, the main question: why didn’t you tell me all this when I called you here before the device? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, he says. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Firstly, everything seems normal here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly - they listen to the phone, and I called during working hours. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, that's fine here.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Total</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, I sat until the end of the day, rushed home, and even on the way I started to freeze. By evening, the temperature was 38, which I was incredibly happy about. Quickly wrote an SMS to the boss that I would be ill, he answered - of course, no question, get well soon. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I had a good few days. I realized that in vain I left my previous job. I realized that I was naughty about a polygraph. I went to him, by the way. I even learned to cheat. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After 3-4 days I arrived and said that I would not work with them. The IT chief, for some reason, was surprised. Again, something was carrying about my crown. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I went to the personnel department, where a pleasant surprise awaited me - they didn’t manage to get me a job in a week, so they just gave me the job. I did not ask for money from them, but it seems that there’s nothing at all.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Kadrovichka said she was already sick of watching programmers quit before they could start working. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I asked to sit down and tell what was wrong with their company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I sat down and told. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She recorded. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The programmer was not surprised at my decision. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A few months later he quit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And after a couple of years he moved to Moscow. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The IT chief came with a glass of water to the programmers' office, and pictorially, with lamentations, blessed the table on which I sat for one day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He said that the table was damned - no one lingered on him for a long time.</font></font></div>
