<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to recognize a psychopath</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes really scary people surround us. People who get everything they want using their charm and ingenuity. Fraudsters. Professional liars. To achieve their goals, they use friends, colleagues, family and strangers. They never apologize or feel remorse for the people who have been hurt. Often their careers are connected with crime. There are many names for them. Narcissus. Asocial. Sociopath. Chief executive officer. But increasingly, we call them psychopaths.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Psychopaths raise many questions. What is wrong with them? Perhaps their parents did not do them at all? Maybe in childhood they suffered from abuse? Maybe something is broken in them, a chemical imbalance or evil demons. Or is this the next stage in the evolution of mankind? Perhaps a new race of superhumans? Can we identify them? Can we spot them in our homes and on the streets? What is going on in their heads? Do they realize what damage they are doing? Do they sleep well at night? How can we deal with them? How can such terrible people even exist? Am I one of them?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fortunately, there are answers that raise the curtain of mystery over psychopathy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the purpose of this book: to understand the mind of a psychopath and write a guide for all people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The material is based on my own experience, as well as on the experience of many others. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It has been tested in reality and seems to work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can now move on to the next passage.</font></font><br>

<h3> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you started this book in the hope that it will help you with a difficult life situation, start here. I will now briefly explain the main points. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You will need to realize a few things. First, have you been a victim of psychological abuse? This is often not obvious. After all, bruises are not physical, but mental. Abusive relationships are tied to lies - the one that your abuser inspires you and the one that you tell yourself. This complicates the vision of the whole picture.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's start with your feelings. How often do you feel depressed, depressed, and even suicidal? Do you feel empty and worthless? Do you spend your life satisfying the needs of another person? Do you take responsibility for the mistakes of others and are you trying to correct them? Don't you think you're losing your mind? Feel like burn out? Are you alone? Have you lost your old friends and acquaintances? Do you drink often? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you agree with the questions on this list, then you are probably in an abusive relationship. Such relationships are much more common than you think. I would say that from 10% to 20% of people are currently in abusive relationships. It is difficult for both victims and their friends and family to recognize, acknowledge and deal with it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Next, we will consider the relationships that bother you. They started "perfectly", and over time turned into a nightmare? Did your relationship survive an unexpected crisis? Are they characterized by flashes of emotions? Is verbal or physical abuse present? Have you invested everything in a relationship without receiving anything in return? Have these relationships begun to crowd out your family and friends? And you can not imagine any other alternatives?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All these are signs of abusive communication. If this describes your situation, then you are in danger. Imagine that the person who does all this is a psychopath with an official and without an official diagnosis. We will return to a detailed diagnosis a little later. Now it‚Äôs important to realize what situation you are in. This may seem random, but it is not. The goal is to confuse and isolate you, deprive you of everything, and then destroy and throw you out. And violence is only a part. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If this does not describe your situation, then you can skip the end of this paragraph.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now look at a stranger. If you have a psychopath in front of you, then you cannot understand its essence. For understanding, you always need to navigate from the side and other people. Is there a person in front of you who cares about others or only about himself? Are his plans thought out or chaotic? Does he save and invest, or does he spend everything clean? Is he surrounded by happy people or obsessed followers? Does he have a solid professional or social history, or is his past a secret? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When you realize that you are a victim of an abusive psychopath, you are halfway to solving the problem. You will want to run, and when you talk about it with other people, they will tell you to do it as soon as possible. After all, a psychopath is considered to be a serial killer.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fact, a ‚Äúpsychopath‚Äù is one who slowly, like a vampire, sucks out your life force for weeks and even years. Physical violence can also be present, but compared to psychological damage, it is negligible. And this means that even if you run away, then the harm done mentally will remain with you. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My strategy is this: patience, observation, and a gradual change in relationship. From a victim and a trickster, you turn into an unshakable force that recognizes and blocks the attacks of a psychopath. Gradually, you weaken your abuser and thereby regain your strength and power. In the end, you end the relationship on your own terms, while remaining a holistic personality.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes you just can tell your abuser "it's over, don't try to contact me again." But often parting with him takes time and effort. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The law, as a rule, often ignores psychological violence between adults. Most psychopaths try not to leave any evidence. Police and courts are cynical about charges such as "he said - she said." And no matter what you say, the psychopath will still lie in response. That is how cults work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, verbal accusations do not work. Most likely they will be used against yourself. Psychopaths are very powerful in verbal wars. Instead, be patient and gather evidence. You can always provoke a psychopath in such a way that he does and says self-destructive things.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When you come across a psychopath or even change your behavior a little, his reaction will be even more abusive. You will be very scared and hurt. You will want everything to become ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again, and part of you will shout ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt provoke him, it will only get worse!‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At this point, many people give up and return to their abusers. It‚Äôs easier to accept than to fight, hurting yourself. But accepting violence means dying a slow death. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Experience has shown that most threats are bluffing and bragging. Predators are actually weak. They cannot withstand the impact. They will growl and intimidate, but, faced with real resistance and the risk of widespread punishment, in most cases they back down.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Study laws on abuse and harassment. Make friends with the local police. Find out what types of applications you can file. Are harsh expressions considered abuse? Or should you have bruises in addition to your medical certificate? Do you have a legal right to record phone calls and conversations? Learn absolutely everything. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you have a common property, business or children - contact a lawyer. The police will provide you with the addresses of local victim support groups. If you are in a difficult family situation, then a psychologist specializing in victims of abyuza will help you get out of this relationship. You should not be ashamed, regardless of your gender, if you ask for help in this situation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Your main superpower is other people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When talking with other people, you will find that you are not alone, and many find themselves in a similar situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you have evidence of abusive behavior, you can file a complaint with the police. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your aggressor can hide only when other people justify and forgive him. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And do not forget about patience and calm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You have a lot to learn and change your root beliefs about life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You are not to blame for anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, these abusers choose their victims, and not vice versa. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read the book carefully and take your situation as an opportunity to become stronger and wiser.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How does this book work?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are eight chapters in The Psychopath Code, each of which tells a piece of the story. You can read them in any order. I would advise you to quickly look through the text first, and then carefully read it several times. Discuss it with people you trust and allow knowledge to gradually absorb. Study, read forums and books. There is a lot to learn, and this takes years. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first chapter gives us the basic hypothesis of the book - psychopaths are social predators to other people. This idea is not new and is becoming mainstream. I just looked at it a little deeper.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the second chapter we learn how psychopaths hunt. It is highly dependent on gender and age. But in each of the cases, the psychopath uses cunning and deceit to approach his victim and enter into a trusting relationship with her. Learn these patterns and it will be impossible to break you. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the third chapter, we see how psychopaths capture their victims and begin to build abusive relationships. To get everything they need from the victim, they isolate and manipulate their target. I repeat - knowing these patterns, you will not be an easy victim. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the fourth chapter, we consider the most severe phase of psychopathic relationships. In it, the psychopath depletes his victim, obliging her to remain silent and obey.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the fifth chapter, we change the rules of the game by tracking and identifying psychopaths. We'll look at over a hundred features and behaviors that you yourself can track, including how you feel in the arms of a psychopath. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the sixth chapter, we will consider human emotions. They are the key to understanding psychopathy and our reaction to it. We will work out about fifty universal emotions, of which there are only nine psychopaths. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the seventh chapter, we will see how you can break out of the psychopath‚Äôs tight embrace. The material explains step by step how to restore your power and weaken your offender. Of course, this cannot happen in one day, so be patient. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In chapter eight, I answer the most frequently asked questions in all of this material.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The book can be bought on Amazon.com and Kindle, and it is also available on psychopathcode.com in the public domain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Please share free PDF texts and e-books with your friends and family.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did the book appear</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am a geek who writes software, articles and books. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I got a degree in computer science. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He studied psychology very little at the university. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Usually, those who write books about psychopaths have a different starting point. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So let me explain how I came to this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Throughout my career I have worked with thousands of people. I have gathered hundreds of teams, built many small businesses, created non-profit and online communities. I had to study human nature. Something lies on the surface. Until something you need to dig. We are insanely complex creatures. Nevertheless, human nature can be deciphered, understood and predicted. It was in Culture &amp; Empire that I began to write about psychology. Social psychology is my professional competence and is part of my interests. That is how groups interact and how people interact within groups. This is the foundation of my work in creating open source communities. It turns out that the software is also about people. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In Culture &amp; Empire, I also saw conflict as a driving force for change.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We all dream of peace and stability. However, throughout history, conflict and chaos have generated the most ambitious changes. We are building a world made up of human rights. We work to protect the environment. We create legal systems, build courts, and hire police to protect peace and prosperity. You may not be aware of this, but </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">violence around the world is becoming less and less every year</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . People are neither good nor evil. People are survivors. We do our best to continue our kind and ensure a favorable future for our children. Most of us succeed through hard work. Some, like parasites, live only by taking everything from others. I call them ‚Äúpretenders‚Äù and ‚Äúdangerous people.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When I finished writing ‚ÄúCulture &amp; Empire‚Äù, I came across dangerous people in my personal life. As a writer, I did not run away and did not deny what was happening. On the contrary, I began to take notes and conduct small experiments. After all, not every day you can play with a psychopath. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I found that my work in social psychology was incomplete. I focused on the pretenders and touched only the top of the dangerous. However, both strategies are not alternatives. They intertwine and interact with each other in a mysterious arms race. And this race is at the heart of what it means to be human. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are many articles on the Internet about psychopaths. </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Year after year, this topic remains widely discussed.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. You can find thousands of stories from people who have come across this. Research by psychologists and psychiatrists. Documents from forensic experts and online dating experts. Even blogs and forums written by diagnosed psychopaths. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And also there are many questions on which there is no single answer. Starting with ‚Äúwhat causes psychopathy?‚Äù Is it possible to cure it and do we want to try it? Can we identify psychopaths ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù without psychiatric expertise? Are they always cruel and dangerous and what factors influence this? Is this the same range of behavior as intelligence? Or is psychopathy more binary as gender? How do psychopaths think and act? Can we somehow protect ourselves?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The authority in the field of psychopaths is Dr. Robert Hare, and I use this term in the same way as he, only from a broader perspective. </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He mainly focuses on men</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and misses a lot of psychopaths. Classical psychopathic research focused on convicted criminals: ordinary law breakers and violent criminals. In the mid-1990s, researchers began to pay attention to those who hide among the common population. These are ‚Äúsubclinical‚Äù or ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù psychopaths who stay away from violent crimes. They are rarely arrested.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In both genders, we see a figure of about 10 percent. ‚ÄúThis is evidenced by some empirical studies ... subclinical psychopathy is much more common than its clinical counterpart, with baseline rates of 5 to 15 percent.‚Äù - Jay S. Thomas, Daniel S. Segal, talking about the work of Gustafson and Ritzer in 1995 and Petman and Erlandson in 2002, in the Comprehensive Handbook of Personality and Psychopathology: Personality and Everyday Functioning (Google books). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It‚Äôs obvious that some psychopaths are more dangerous than others. I will use 4% as the final figure. It‚Äôs somewhat arbitrary. If we take it below, we will miss most of the psychopaths and the harm they cause. If we take it above, we will make them insignificant. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although many psychopaths look completely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, it seems to me (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and many researchers also adhere to this idea</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ) that they hide behind other personality disorders - narcissistic, borderline and hysterical. This is especially true for girl psychopaths. If you take this into account, the picture becomes clearer and more detailed. We also gain knowledge that will be useful to us to deal with the damage caused by these disorders. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In theory, borderline personality disorder is treated with medication and therapy. In practice, the opposite is true. The same applies to psychopaths with a diagnosis of "antisocial personality disorder." Therapy supposedly helps them to manipulate people even more.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What really helps is limiting and correcting the damage done by psychopaths. Like school bullies, psychopaths do not suffer from depression. Family, friends and colleagues fall under fire. And you can intervene as soon as you realize how they act. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Interfering is not so easy. Dealing with people who have fascinated, manipulated, and intimidated others all their lives is not possible by default. If you try to warn several people, you yourself will remain to blame. Try to warn one - he will be opposed to you. You must act slowly, carefully, with the right knowledge. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, the book focuses on this process - how to recognize it, how it works and how to turn it off.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am not a specialized psychologist or psychiatrist. I can not argue with authority. But I can develop schemes and test them on psychopaths familiar to me. I can test them using unusual situations from the past. And also with the help of people who are associated with them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have been studying literature, forums, books, and articles for years. Anything that can shed light on the mystery of such mysterious people and how they live. I discussed this with hundreds of people. Including psychologists who specialize in abuse and developmental disabilities. People who managed to get out of an abusive relationship. Those who attempted suicide on this basis. And also those whose parents were abusive and fit the description of psychopaths.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I used these models to build sanctuary gardens in my personal and professional life. Those who work with me know that all our online communities are, above all, places of happiness. And this is no coincidence. A lot of thorough work has been done on how to keep dangerous people out of their way. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I worked with follow-ups, field-proven studies, and a single position as possible. I kept as far as possible from speculation and opinion for my own good. However, I tell many stories, and some of them are more bizarre than others. This is a necessity. My experience told me that it was necessary to solve deeper and more important problems. And I wanted to solve these problems for myself, my friends and family. </font></font><br>

In his book, ‚ÄúAll Life Is Problem Solving,‚Äù Karl Popper wrote:</font></font><br>
<blockquote>   .         .      /  .      .        .  :    ,   ,    .</blockquote> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Please look for errors in my wild irresponsible ideas, and then work with me to eliminate or correct them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I avoided jargon and understatement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is much easier to criticize a clear idea. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can never reach the truth, but we can find the best approximations to it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes this requires big leaps and reasonable guesswork. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes we must be prepared to think in unorthodox directions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I put forward many theories and expose them as if they were facts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I apologize in advance for such a style. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I also apologize for the assumption that I was wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hope those right parts make it all significant.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Acceptance of the past </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If your former partner turned out to be a psychopath, then this book will return your memories. Will cause you strong emotions. You may not want to read it, so as not to experience it all over again. This is a common and understandable reaction. The dominant view of the experience is that rethinking our experience will stop the healing process. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Avoiding, however, means being helpless. And helplessness will ultimately lead us to depression. And spent hours talking with those who survived a psychopathic relationship. I listened to their stories about endless emotional bullying, betrayal, manipulation, theft. I also shared my stories. And I told those stories that I tell in this book. Who are the psychopaths. What do they think. Where does the power come from. What do they look like. And, most importantly, how to repulse them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our experiences are very similar. As if every psychopath on Earth reads the same manual. When I speak with a new group, at least a quarter of them light up and say: ‚ÄúJust like in my previous relationship.‚Äù I explain how I learned to deal with such people in the past and present. They tell me: ‚ÄúYou must write a book.‚Äù And I reply: ‚ÄúAnd I am writing.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I advise you to accept your past. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not avoid it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Face them and analyze. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then use this new knowledge in order to become stronger and happier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is why I wrote this book. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wanted to present psychopathy in a more positive way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not that psychopaths were nice people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are also pleasant as a nail in the hand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, if you read to the end of this book, I promise that you will look at psychopathy with different eyes. </font></font><br>
