<sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The administrator</font></font></sup><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
on </font><sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">duty</font></sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 2 weeks ago, the level of paranoia in Tutu.ru was low, so we bought a pyrometer and a couple of accurate thermometers in the office, installed points with hand disinfection for surgeons in operating boxes at different ends, wiped all ventilation from the inside with a disinfectant and set up manic cleaning mode - disinfection of all surfaces every morning, in the usual cleaning cycle - disinfection of pens and the rest. Hazelnuts of nuts were removed in the kitchen and other things, they left only what was individually wrapped. It is fortunate that bananas and oranges grow immediately packaged. We conducted VPN exercises and worked out mechanisms for switching to a remote site.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since Monday, the office has completely switched to remote work. About 350 people. For the last 15 years I have been appearing in my offices a couple of times a week, so the situation is familiar. Actually, this applies to almost anyone who travels a lot. But I'm not tied to infrastructure like call center software, repositories, and private segments with personal data. Since we are still a travel service, the rest in the office are prepared in much the same way, but with nuances.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
70% of employees have office laptops. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the basic configuration, it is either Lenovo with an office dock, or a MacBook with a monitor into which everything else is stuck. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, you can just tear off the car by default and take it home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And pick up your wireless keyboards and mice from the workplace. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naturally, not everyone has it - there are those who, for a number of reasons, want and love to sit at the desktop in the office. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Over the past week, the AXO has asked people to carry home devices for remote exercises, so on Monday we could just switch to the new mode.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Newly made remote employees without a laptop were divided into three categories:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your desktop at home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ok, no question, you can work with it in common segments.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pick up the desktop from the office. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything is clear too.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Throw a bridge to a working desktop from home via remote access and work like this. </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another part was asked to give out laptops. We always have a reserve for new employees, plus a couple of weeks ago a batch of macbooks arrived (they must be ordered in advance, now there are supply disruptions and delays), so there were enough free devices. They remained now, but the reserve is already less. A couple of people asked for monitors, issued.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before all this blizzard, the company already had remote admins and developers. The work of the administrator from home is no different from the usual work in the office. The entire Atlasian stack works great from anywhere, so no one in Jira knows where you are physically. The developers used a special VPN, which gave access to development services like repositories, analytics, and more. Admins are another VPN. OTP paid - there are licenses, in fact, for convenience. Among other features - dynamic ACLs, that is, the ability to give different users different accesses within the network. Now the licenses are over, so the admins have deployed a second VPN, which is already more cond in configuration, but solves the problem. Naturally,With the transition to mass VPN access, it was immediately necessary to add more sources to the information security monitoring and to work hard on the first false-positive incidents.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are a few physical phones in the office. First of all, this means that at least one person must remain to monitor them. Secondly, they support call forwarding to mobiles, and the usual scenario is 6 beeps before transferring to mobile. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All closed circuits require a physical presence under the law. This means at least one personnel officer, security guard and lawyer from time to time in a deserted office. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There was still the administrator on duty. We have a server room for infrastructure tasks in the office (and prod in four geo-distributed data centers). Admin sometimes goes to the server room. He also monitors the issuance of laptops and desktops to those who return from vacation to this apocalyptic world. After a couple of weeks, constant duty will not be necessary.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another extremely unpleasant moment for visiting the office is working with the originals of paper documents. Yes, now is 2020, but they still remained in a number of cases. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For all those who need an office for business needs, we do not recommend traveling by public transport. Taxi is paid by the company. You can choose any aggregator, then send the bookkeeping check - almost the same mechanics of the advance report work as on business trips.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Considering that in the company of very often traveling people there is always a remote site in one form or another, all protocols have long been worked out. No trackers that record time or take screenshots - only the result of tasks is always evaluated. How to control people in such a situation? No way. Need to follow the work. But there is an understanding that if someone fails in the jungle of procrastination and regularly creates ‚Äúgags‚Äù for his team, then after everyone returns to the office, the possibility of remote work for such a person will be greatly limited at the maximum interval.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have long been accustomed to communications through Zoom. It is very good for meetings, only before we brought one or two participants to the wall of the meeting room, and now we all meet in it. A free account is enough for most tasks - but today there will be a meeting for about 200 people online (monthly general demo), it will be more difficult there. At night there were test runs, in the afternoon an attempt to collect. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The usual communication takes place in a telegram most often, some teams use slack or our corporate Zulip (this is critical for the HR segment and accounting, for example). You can use Google Hangouts, Discord (it is convenient to create a permanent voice channel and adjust the volume for each participant separately) and even, sorry, Skype.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the other hand, everything ‚Äúkicked and found out‚Äù flew out of the processes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The pace of development will not slow down, but information about what happens in neighboring teams will go away. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All the internal guilds went down the forest. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All teams do not recruit new people (because at least a week before being removed is recommended in the office). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More precisely, they are gaining, but so far there have been no cases of withdrawal to the team these days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This process has been slightly suspended, but soon we‚Äôll come up with something. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Etiquette (we took part and transferred to ourselves from the book ‚ÄúRemote: an office is not required‚Äù by Jason Freud and David Hensson):</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is advisable for all teams to be stable in contact from 11 to 17 Moscow time on weekdays, or to make sure that the absence of a person will not hurt someone. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sprints become as weekly as possible.</font></font></li>
<li>        ,   .     ,      .</li>
<li> -          ‚Äî   . </li>
<li> -  - ,         .                . </li>
<li>  ‚Äî     30 .      , ,       .      ,    .</li>
<li>   10 ,     ,     ,     .              .         .      ,        .  . </li>
<li>    ‚Äî  (),   ‚Äî .         .    ¬´!¬ª,  ¬´! , , -¬ª. </li>
<li>       ,    ,        . </li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the first couple of days of the mass exodus to the remote site, due to the large number of chats and people, several more good practices appeared in them:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Agreements, logs of stand-ups and resumes of calls are denoted by stars in Zulip: when someone returns after a long absence in the channel, it is enough to read only the marked messages so as not to miss anything. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So that the team members, getting out of the code, do not catch 100-200 unread ones, you need to call up if you can‚Äôt agree immediately. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conditionally, if a question takes more than 20 messages - a call and fixing in a chat. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Voice channels in Discord proved to be excellent for constant discussion of one task, so as not to clutter up the team‚Äôs general chat. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Flood to flood channels (separate from working team chats).</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No need to smear tasks at different entry points: it is better that they come in one particular channel. </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The general paradigm of the remote is to divide the work into completely autonomous components. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each team should be full-stack and be responsible for creating the product from idea to implementation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We don‚Äôt know how to make a general demo, but we will try soon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We don‚Äôt know how to keep the general context in development, but we‚Äôll try to do the Monday 10-minute common stand-up in writing as a digest with the goals of each team for a week in confluence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We don‚Äôt know what is happening with the guilds, but now there will already be the first digests with what issues will be discussed, instructions will be updated on how to connect to guild events and channels.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We were lucky in that there was not much technical debt on this part of the work (in particular, on workflow stacks, knowledge bases, trackers and accesses), and we did everything right away and without panic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The HR department quickly switched to providing logistics transition and informing everyone on time about the details. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Admins will survive any end of the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most of the external events and conferences were canceled by the organizers themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, everything is calm in Baghdad.</font></font></div>
