<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Before doing Uncle Scrooge‚Äôs favorite business, you need to set up the bill acceptor and coin acceptor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will build on the work of our board with pre-installed Game Elf games. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It has a Jamma interface and with the help of it communicates with the outside world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If everything is clear with the connection of buttons, sticks and power, the question arises, how to connect our denominator and coin box to this miracle of Chinese engineering? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The coin acceptor works simply, four wires at the output: + 12v, GND, Coin Signal, Counter Metr. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We throw power and earth to the unit, and connect the signal to Jamma. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the fourth wire we will hang a coin counter, which in the future will help us to reveal the insidious plot of the owners of one of the bars about which at the end of the article. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We insert a sample in the form of a 10 ruble coin, check. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Works!</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You can breathe freely and without straining to connect the bill acceptor to the board, because we now know what, where and how it works. Never before in my life have I been so mistaken. At the time of the creation of the project in RuNet, there was no place to take information on connecting a bill acceptor to this board, I had to use the ‚Äúpoke method‚Äù. Having picked up the instructions for connecting the bill, I whipped up + 12v and GND, but there are still a lot of wires, and which one to connect as the signal to COIN? Everything is simple! We flip a coin and connect the most successful wire. Does not work. Once again delving into the instructions, little by little, understanding of the operation of such devices begins to come. As it turned out, our CashCode MVU 1024 can work already in 5 different protocols Pulse, Cashcode serial, Ccnet, Mdb, rs232. Each protocol has its own connection scheme and method of communication with the device.This was a turning point and made communication with banknotes much more pleasant in all subsequent projects.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After a little reflection, I came to the conclusion that I needed the Pulse protocol. Connected, it works! But, as Lieutenant Rzhevsky said, there is one caveat! For 100 rubles gives one attempt, but we need one attempt for 10 rubles. Having defeated the inner uncle of Scrooge, we set the position of the Dip Switches on the banknote in the right position to give one signal for 10 rubles and you're done! It works like a clock. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instructions and designations</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
On the bill acceptor and coin acceptor panel we indicate the cost of 10 rubles = 1 credit. Denominations of accepted banknotes, links to the site with information. The most important instruction is how to use. We duplicate the instructions on the control panel in front of the player himself. There will be no excess.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's time to test the machine. Everything is fine, accepts banknotes, launches games. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
You can already put the machine into operation, but the terrible appearance of the start screen of the game board is striking. That would be a way to color it in the colors of our project. </font></font><br>

</i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
And there is this method! We take the SD card from the board and removes the disk image from it. We unpack it and among many folders and files with games we find what we have been looking for. A folder with graphic files of the shell itself! </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Among the graphic files, we are looking for the EN language we need and a resolution of 640x480. Gotcha! Searched file for processing bg640480.png. It remains to edit it to our needs. By the way, in the same folder are sound files of the shell, you can change the composition on the start screen and other sounds of the board. There is scope for creativity. We make a new graphic file of the shell with the obligatory preservation of the original name, change the starting music to your favorite composition. Done! </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Now, the appearance of the graphical shell does not raise questions and perfectly suits the design of the entire Arcade machine. Anything expensive. </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Arcade machine at the installation site</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After all the settings, it's time to install Arcade machines in places of constant deployment. Logically, it is necessary to establish in crowded places geeks and interested people, mainly males and at the age of 25-45 years. But there were no such places in my city. Nevertheless, all three machines were built by acquaintance in test locations: a bar, a hookah and a night club. The places are excellent and there was confidence that adequate visitors would not tear the machines to shreds in a few days. And so it happened, the machines worked in the hookah room, and the night club for one month, the machine worked in the bar for much longer. I want to express my gratitude to the owners of institutions that supported the idea!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He decided to send two free machine guns to the glorious big city. And then it became much more fun: regularly they began to pop coins into the bill acceptor, thereby putting the last out of order, stuffed a variety of garbage into the control panel and, on the whole, there were a lot of vandal actions in relation to automatic machines. A special charm was a phone call from a friend during a routine inspection of machines, in which he informed me about the disappearance of red balls from the sticks of management. Subsequently, this became the "norm" and a strong-willed decision was made to fasten them to superglue. Collection of money from vending machines was unremarkable until one day, suddenly in one vending machine did not show up money from the word "completely." The owner claimed that the machine stood off, but remember the Counter metr mentioned at the beginning of the article when connecting the coin acceptor? There was data on it,which made it clear that the owner, to put it mildly, fantasizes and gives out wishful thinking. The machine was immediately taken out of this magical place.</font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The harsh reality</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
I know, I know you are waiting for the numbers. The machines worked for a total of 4 months in different places. The average earnings from one machine is 6500 rubles per month. A lot depends on the installation location, day of the week and the contingent of the institution where the machine is installed. Why did I remove the machines, did not begin to collect new ones and continue to move in this direction? The answer is simple, collect and play such machines with friends, you do not need to use them in commercial activities. Unless, of course, you have a commercial license from the copyright holder to use the games. I hope the previous sentence closed all questions regarding the legality of such activities.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite all the difficulties in the assembly, installation, legal issues and maintenance of such machines, it was incredibly exciting to assemble and implement such a project with your own hands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I gained a huge amount of experience and knowledge in working with bill acceptors and coin acceptors, vending equipment and the legal side of the issue, which I successfully use in new projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the most important thing is people, wonderful people I managed to work with, without the support of the owners of the establishments where we exhibited automatic machines, nothing would have worked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks you! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And thank you for reading to the end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">See you in new articles about new projects! </font></font><br>
