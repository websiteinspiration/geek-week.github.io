We conducted most of the discussions in English-language forums, trying to help users primarily with advice, rather than self-promotion, giving the most detailed and impartial answer, because our experience in the field has been over 14 years, hundreds of successful solutions and thousands of satisfied customers. Nevertheless, our answers should not be taken as the only correct answers of the first instance, they may well contain inaccuracies and even errors, no one is perfect. We will be grateful if you add or correct them in the comments.</font></font><br>

In this part, I will look at real conflict situations and how we resolved them. Perhaps someone will disagree with my decisions, but these are cases that actually arise in the process of our work with people. Communicating with people, I remember that these are not impersonal personalities, but first of all people, people with whom we cooperate and this cooperation should be mutually beneficial. That is, as an owner, I must simultaneously defend the interests of our company, employees, and customers. Sometimes customers do not fully understand all the subtleties or are so complex that others would have surrendered and denied service for a long time. Nevertheless, we work with everyone, even with the most difficult cases. And rarely when we deny people their desires, but sometimes we have to refuse. Let these cases serve as an examplehow to or should not be done and everyone will draw conclusions himself.</font></font><br>

It seems like a fair desire, if not for one thing, but our experts have already spent time for free (for the client), to transfer it to the air force and configure it if possible so that everything flies with it, despite the problem with scripts. Indeed, on hosting, thin tuning of server settings for a specific project is impossible. That is, we left this client somewhere at minus 2 hours of specialist work and consultations, which will pay off for us in a year or so, 1.5-2 if the client continues to rent VPS and does not create a new load on those departments, so as time is the most precious thing we have.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, in this case, the client wanted to return "everything as it was," while again spending free time and energy for our administrators. Last time, the client refused to pay anything for escort services, but we did not insist, because we didn’t notify in advance that the transfer would be paid, we had to work as a bonus, otherwise we would continue to receive complaints from him when working on the hosting, which would take would have even more time. Therefore, we could not make a meeting on the issue of further free work, explaining that he can move to the hosting on his own, if for him the difference of $ 30 per year is such a significant amount and he does not want to take advantage of the virtual server. We also had to refuse early cancellation of the virtual server with recalculation,since in spite of paying it for a year, it’s completely unprofitable for us to recalculate the service on account of a lower cost service, despite the fact that we spent the time of support for free. What I notified the client by writing the truth.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The moral of this story is this. Clients can and should meet, but if any of the parties becomes unprofitable, you should not be shy to explain the situation to people. That is why the following response was sent to the client:</font></font><br>

In order to reflect the essence of the issues, I just put a few screenshots, these screenshots will not contain any personal data of the client and do not violate his rights, since the client is registered in our system under an unreal name and we still do not we know who he is and even if we knew, we could not share the information here in view of the GDPR data protection policy. At first he was foka ne foka, then Cupi Cupi, then Carlson Carlson, then Wiinniee Wiinniee. The client does nothing wrong, there are no complaints about him, most likely he posts a grid of gs sites that promote other sites. Which is not very good, of course, since it clogs the search. But if Google and Yandex themselves clog their search with ads and make money on it, then why can't others also? In general, we do not blame such customers,as they help to make services cheaper for customers with sites for people (SDL). At the same time, he constantly strives to break his server, here is an example of a problem last month, there were 5 of them last month, but I give one example - an unsuccessful PHP update, in order to understand what communication style you have to meet:</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the same month, the problem was more serious: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/wo/lv/emwolv0lm49dje1zlmypy7svq7q.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before that, the client deleted the / bin system folder and wrote to the server “did not understand”:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/7-/9p/pz7-9p77cf2fpucxylvlvembw1a.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What led TOP of the stupidest server commands, I think that the server also "did not understand" it and, unlike our administrators, could not give an answer :) It is thanks to such destructive actions of the client, as well as a manner of communication that does not help solve the problem, and even distracting, the excess of the time included in the tariff in May was 9 hours. At the same time, instead of accepting the option I proposed - upgrading to tariff plan A retroactively from May 1 (which costs 50% more at $ 30 per month is more expensive and includes 10 hours of work per month, which doesn’t cover all our costs, but at least somehow keeps the client within), the client refused to pay for the cut. I had to block the server - the client refused to pay the load it created for those.department and continued to storm those department with the requirements to fix the problem and the sales department that he did not agree to pay the bill, and I did not agree to pay for the services of our tech. department instead of the client, since all the costs, to one degree or another, are on me.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ig/yj/n5/igyjn5j6d2glrlzwm5mwzhtf90q.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, we had to demand payment for an excess according to the terms of its tariff - $ 20 per hour (until the moment of payment, the service was blocked, according to the offer agreement, so that nothing was violated on our part), because many previous times it was sincerely sorry for it, because the administrators they asked "for the last time to help" and so on and the administrators gave up, because it was easier to decide what to arrange a "carousel", as Roman, the head of those departments called it: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0i/6_/jy/0i6_jyh26xsun1p5gmwry975s4i.jpeg"><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/iz/pt/vvizpt-xvewluw-utqkjv-swctu.jpeg"><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nt/ay/8a/ntay8aghgcvjcnzztxy-yhdwcyi.jpeg"><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/lx/p0/lylxp0dc8ialn5-ccyhhgmqdtfy.jpeg"><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/xt/9v/rcxt9v2h5grfl8xloez0kyj5t3o.jpeg"><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eq/d2/aj/eqd2ajrp_raqrtchsxtajbb9koi.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And even after that, the client did not agree to switch to an updated tariff with a large time limit. Although, if you count, 180 dollars would be enough for half a year of escort every month for 10 hours by our specialists. And he would save him time and nerves, in the end, he chose the option of payment at the standard rate, and not upgrade retroactively. Such are strange cases with strange people.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Nevertheless, our technical department patiently and steadily processes such requests, but I have to make sure that subscribers do not like too much for free brains and at the same time take sometimes tough measures. It is worth noting that 3 days before the shutdown, the client was notified. He had the right not to pay this debt and simply collect data from the server and refuse our services, but even for this task he turned to those. the Department. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The bill was paid 2 days after blocking, the client continued to work, requests in those. the sales department and the sales department continue to go, and we continue to solve them. This month alone, we have already given over support for the time, as we had to write 19 answers to the sales department and 10 answers to the technical department. And today is only the 9th. Moreover, the time of the sales department is not taken into account :)</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Perhaps it is worth developing a system that would allow customers to write only a certain number of requests to departments for free, would this help such people to formulate their thoughts in only one message and more fully? Otherwise, if the healthy limit was exceeded, it would give out: “the number of free appeals has been exceeded, you need to replenish your account to write off $ 3 for considering your next appeal”. It seems to me that in the case of working with some complex clients, who very often have to solve tasks in a circle, turn on the “carousel”, or do the same work several times, this system would be extremely useful. Well, it’s worth it to strain our programmer and such a rare task. Since to put such a system for all customers and thereby limit communication, perhaps it makes no sense. What do you think?</font></font><br>
