      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/496968/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The situation with coronavirus is developing rapidly, and even the most venomous skeptic has already passed his ‚Äústages of acceptance‚Äù, from ironic jokes and ridicule to alarming uncertainty about tomorrow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the changes that are taking place perfectly show the professionalism of each of us, and, unfortunately, not all leaders cope with the difficulties of a pandemic, saving face. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I analyzed the experience and feedback of my colleagues and acquaintances from various fields (not only IT), whose companies are experiencing some difficulties, and identified 4 gross errors that, in my opinion, are unacceptable in the current reality.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> My opinion is subjective and may differ from the opinion of other readers of Habr - I will be glad to discuss the topic in the comments or personally on the sidelines. </font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Switch to a remote site, leaving workers at full load in the office</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I may be old-fashioned, but the general who hides in the headquarters during the decisive hostilities is a coward, not a leader. In difficult times, soldiers should feel the support of their leader, know that he does not give a damn about their fate. If the current leaders are doing well in public speaking, then there are already difficulties with being at the front lines. So, in one of the companies of my acquaintances, all the top management switched to a remote place a few weeks before the first antiseptics appeared in the halls of workrooms - where ordinary employees were still working at full load at 8 working hours.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When you occupy a leadership position, the position of "everyone for himself" loses its strength. You are responsible for your people whom you have accepted into your company and whose work brings you profit, prestige and professionalism. If you save yourself from COVID-19, moving to a remote place, but leave the workers at the front office, you are cutting the branch on which you are sitting. The notorious ‚Äúsediment‚Äù left by the employees will by no means contribute to the Stakhanov‚Äôs rise and labor exploits after the pandemic. I always said and will repeat again: motivation should be not only material. When people feel that their leader does not give a damn about their comfort and safety, they rightly lose their degree of commitment to such a leader and this workplace.</font></font><br>

<h4>2.   ,    </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose you agree on the importance of such a precaution as remote work, and decide to put your employees in this mode of operation. A reasonable question arises: who is the first? A simple and easy answer would be: "He who asks." Like, the department / department / stream that asked you to transfer employees to a remote mode of operation, and leaves with your permission. Who is the first, that and slippers, as they say. However, mindlessly affixing the resolution ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù on the memorandum, you deprive your workflow of stability and go against so carefully developed business logic.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important to evaluate the role and place of the unit in question in the overall work process. If the department‚Äôs work is directly related to face-to-face communication with customers (ex: ticket offices, small cosmetology, medical dressings), then transferring this team to a remote location will paralyze the link in the value chain and block other departments that continue to work afterwards. If the work of the department is tied to a large amount of confidential information (eg: bank vaults, databases with medical information of clients), then the speed of transferring a team to a remote work format is directly proportional to the complexity of setting up access to information outside your organization. If the work of the department is already partially automated (eg: call centers, registration of incoming applications), then the translation of this team will be more optimal and less painful.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h4>3.      </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In no way diminishing the importance and strength of the devastating consequences of a pandemic for your business, I still want to emphasize the importance of As Is status. Yes, with the changing economic situation in the world as a whole and in your contractual arrangements with customers in particular, you may suffer losses and lose the expected profit. But do not forget: your employees are your same customers. They provide you with their services, competencies, knowledge and professionalism in exchange for appropriate compensation. And they have the right to expect your fulfillment of your part of the contract. These are the rules of the game: "you to me, I to you."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In times of crisis, no one will do charity work - and your staff is no exception. Why should they agree to lower wages at the same load, just because the company has ‚Äúhard times‚Äù? Their professionalism has not changed, the desire to eat and pay the bills is also in place. Therefore, it is extremely important for you to provide your employees with an alternative solution. For example, if you want to reduce salaries, then change the working mode accordingly, reducing the number of working hours per week. If you cancel the tuition fee, then consider the possibility of advanced training at the workplace (eg: internal seminars, certification). If you are forced to cancel previous agreements (on promotion, salary, rotation, etc.), offer an alternative,which will satisfy the employee‚Äôs need for professional growth and development (new deadline, front of work, direction, etc.).</font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prepare alternative solutions to forced salary cuts and cancellation of previous agreements so that employees do not feel cheated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The pandemic will end, and you still have to do business - make sure that by the end of the quarantine you do not remain at the helm alone.</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Open Door Policy vs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">rejection of comments</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A double position is taken by some companies that practice "open letters." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Beautiful and cordial statements may play into the hands in shaping the image of the company in the press, but before publishing the text, ask yourself the question: are my employees up to date? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The created image of the "company-mother" will crumble like a house of cards if employees learn the news about future changes through these very open letters published on various portals, and not directly from their immediate supervisor.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not hearing answers from you, your employees will go looking for them in other places. In the best case, it will be smoking rooms at your offices, thanks to which your office will be filled with rumors, gossip and speculation, densely seasoned with nervousness and panic. In the worst case, tormented by a fair desire to know the truth, employees will turn to the press - and not always their questions will contribute to the prosperity of the image of your company. By answering questions from the public, but ignoring the concerns of your employees, you are ruining your own and company‚Äôs reputation with your own hands. In a crisis there are no uncomfortable questions - put up with this and tell the truth.</font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Be courageous and speak openly with your staff. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But do not slip into ‚Äúloud speeches from the embrasure‚Äù and avoid frankly pathos phrases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having all the information, your employees have the right to decide to leave your company or stay in it - give them the opportunity to see the full picture. </font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unfortunately, the current situation around the world is something that was difficult to prepare for and impossible to foresee. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But history does not know the subjunctive mood, so it is important for you to maintain professionalism and solve problems here and now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Do not give in to panic, but do not lose prudence" - this is the motto that I personally follow every day when I start work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ability to adapt to an ever-changing reality is undoubtedly the most important skill of 2020. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So pump it - "without departing from the cash register."</font></font></div>
