<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If anyone does not know, the Russian AI Cup (hereinafter RAIK) is an artificial intelligence programming championship where we (or rather our program) must manage one or more characters (units) that compete with each other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year the game was a 2-dimensional platformer resembling computer games of the early 90s, and the units were armed men who were supposed to kill the same men of the enemy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can read more about this in the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">announcement.</font></font></a><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ku/6b/jq/ku6bjqmmkzkgx2oovkjaaujp_bm.png"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This time there was no meeting when the agenda came for the start of the RAIK, so let's get right to the point.</font></font><br>
<br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First look</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, I ran over the rules, tried the game. The first impression was - what to do here? Since the units did not have inertia, and the initial levels were without closed cycles, the enemy could always stick to us if he wanted to, and defend himself against this was impossible. And in this situation, you understand, the possibilities are very limited. You won‚Äôt dodge bullets. But my first fears did not materialize, although the factor of chance was high, the rules turned out to be quite playable. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I did not immediately begin to develop, a couple of days </font></font><s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">fell a fool</font></font></s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">decided to reflect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I didn‚Äôt come up with anything special. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is clear that you need to dodge bullets, run after first-aid kits, and if possible, do not let the enemy take a first-aid kit and all that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was still some vague plan to find strategically advantageous positions, and revolves around them, but it was not entirely clear how to distinguish these positions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Start</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So here we go. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Out of habit, I convert the data objects in the language pack into my own data structures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, it takes some time, but not very much, but I get more flexibility, work in a more familiar environment, and while I convert, it‚Äôs better to begin to understand how the game world works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, not all at once, but as needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, I did not recreate the mines until the political situation at the championship forced me to resort to extreme measures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I approximately copied the logic of Smartgayev, adding only a check for the presence of a wall between me and the enemy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I looked, they seem to be running fine, so we can assume that we have a game world.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Simulation</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now we proceed to the most favorite pastime of all RAIK participants: we are writing a simulation! After reading the championship chat, it became clear that writing an accurate simulation is bad. So I immediately scored for accuracy. It turned out, as it happened, even with a simple rebound from the ceiling, there was a discrepancy within the teak. It was possible, of course, to tinker with it for several days and significantly increase the accuracy, but, firstly, it is not known what profit would be from this. Secondly, I was too impatient, and as always I wanted to see the result as quickly as possible. So I decided to start writing the strategy itself, and I thought I would correct my simulation curve, then, if necessary. In hindsight, I must say that perhaps I was wrong.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It would be worthwhile to immediately bring the simulation to normal, and so it was necessary to make corrections there until the end of the championship, and still it remained crooked.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strategy basis</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then we proceed according to the standard scenario: we generate the sequence of actions of </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unit </font></font><s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">robots</font></font></s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , simulate a change in the game world and submit it all to the input of the evaluation function (OF). If in football (last year‚Äôs tournament) it was ineffective to run after the ball with a complete random number of players (there is too little chance to hit the ball, especially from the right angle), then there is no such problem. Basically, we need a simulation for two things: dodging bullets and finding the way. A few completely random action scenarios are enough to evade bullets. Several dozens of scenarios will also work for search of a way more or less, at least, on not so difficult maps.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, the search for the way - it‚Äôs clear that counting to the end is not always possible, so you need to be able to determine the distance. Using the same simulation, one could more or less accurately calculate distances in time. But here I also simplified it, just counted the distances along a rectangular grid. This simplification, of course, had some consequences on complex maps. Sometimes my units were still confused in the search for weapons, while the enemy was already starting firing. True, these incidents were quite rare. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The choice of target was quite simple: while there are no weapons, we go to weapons, if there are weapons, we go to the enemy, and if there is little "health", we go to the medicine cabinet. In the case of first-aid kits and weapons, those objects that were closer to the enemy as a target were excluded. For some reason, the priority on weapons for me was first on the machine.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first evaluation function consisted of two components: it is health (not mine, but a unit) with a large coefficient, and the distance to the target with a small coefficient. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Those. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the route was chosen in which it does not fall under the bullets, but at the same time approaches the target as quickly as possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important to remember the best route found for the next tick, otherwise a situation may arise when we find a good option, but did not give it out at the next tick.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We go to the front, and the first improvements</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Looking at the battles, it was clear that if the enemy had a normal dodge, then it was almost impossible to get into him from a long distance. This is a waste of bullets. So I added a simple condition for shooting: shoot only if the enemy is closer than 7 meters. In addition, if the distance is very large, then it is worth recharging, even if only one bullet is missing in the clip. These two simple conditions added quite a bit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This was the first version I sent. On the same day, I realized that a gun is more profitable than a machine gun. Plus, he added to the OB another distance to the enemy, in case the shot is not soon. Thus, when reloading, he tried to keep his distance.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The start was quite successful. I don‚Äôt remember how high the strategy managed to rise in the ranking before the reset (somewhere around the first three-five), and after the reset it confidently went up. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main improvement in the next version was due to an attempt to control first-aid kits. Here again, everything was simple: the distance from the first-aid kits to me and the enemy was calculated, and if they were approximately equal, then it was believed that the first-aid kit was draw, and so, the one to whom it is closer. This was taken into account by the evaluation function. Those. in theory, the unit tried to position itself so as to obscure as many first-aid kits as possible. In theory, of course, but not in practice.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After that, I did not send updates for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To my surprise, the strategy first reached the 1st place, and then still came off by 100+ points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Probably everyone thought that I was cutting something cool, and I was shocked how this wretched strategy soared. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Miserable, because, well, there is a clumsy control of first-aid kits, there are two ifs for shooting, but basically this is a simple dodge and movement based on a simulation curve.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Testing</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I would like to talk about this separately, because proper testing is a very important part of development, and many participants seem to ignore this aspect. Accident is intuitively misunderstood by people. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose we run a test and after 40 games we see a score of 27:13 in favor of the new one. That's all, we found the Grail, stop the test and accept the changes. In fact, even with equal forces, there is approximately 2% probability of such a situation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another example, we launch 100 games and accept the changes if the score is 55:45 or more. With a probability of 2.8%, a version can play this way, which in reality should lose with the same score. A couple percent of the error may not seem very large, but if 90% of our changes are unsuccessful, then this means that every 4th change accepted will be unsuccessful. So, even 100 games are still a so-so test, but less - nothing at all. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, launching several hundred games can take an indecent amount of time. There are different options, you can run tests at night, drive in the background, rent server time, or make the strategy fast :) My first versions worked on average, somewhere, for 5 seconds. to the game, so lucky with that.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the strategy is slow, then you can locally drive truncated versions - fewer searches, less micro-ticks, for example. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I used this in football (previous RAIK), no problems were noticed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps the quality is lost somewhere, but, in any case, it is more profitable than checking for changes on 20 games.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Enhancements</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This time I will not evaluate the improvements in numbers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Firstly, they were all small (less than 20%) and therefore inaccurate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, ambiguous, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the new version could confidently beat the previous one, and play worse against others. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And thirdly, I just don‚Äôt remember them.</font></font><br>

<h3>  -</h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Objectively, you need to shoot in the direction where the mat. damage expectation is highest. It is clear that analytically this cannot be calculated, and where mathematics does not help, as we know, simulation comes to the rescue. We shoot in all possible directions and try to dodge the enemy from each bullet individually. To each pool we assign the minimum damage value that it will inflict precisely. In the case of a conventional bullet, it is either 0 or its damage, and in the case of a rocket there are 3 options.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now we know the mat. expecting damage in each direction separately, from this we can easily calculate the mat. wait for each direction of the shot and choose the best. It would be nice to use this function in enumeration so that the unit is correctly positioned, but it was too slow to call it for each scenario. It was called once per tick for each unit, and now the shooting was carried out not by distance, but if the expected damage exceeded a certain limit. The increase was significant, and in the case of the bazooka it looked pretty clear - now mine could even aim somewhere on the wall in order to hit the enemy with a blast wave.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ld/hl/kx/ldhlkxxwryxjhw90gcamtdchlhq.gif"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But due to the fact that I could not insert this function into the search, there was a problem that the conditions for the shot in the search and in reality were different. I did not know how to solve this problem, I had to live with it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After that, there were no very significant changes until the last day when I introduced self-blasting. He added a penalty if there was no jump left at the moment when the enemy fired, because falling would make it harder to dodge. I tried to predict the path of the enemy to the first-aid kit, if he has few lives, and thus slightly improved control over them. He himself began to run after first-aid kits from 60% of his health, instead of 50%. He added the distance between his in the PF so that they would not interfere with each other, and the bazooka would not immediately knock out two. In the end, he added an aggressive mod in case the situation does not change for a long time and I lose on points, otherwise mine sometimes get stuck.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">results</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As I said, pretty quickly got to first place in the ranking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the exception of short periods of time, I stayed there until the end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the rounds, the situation was a little worse: 4th place in the first, 3rd in the second. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This indicated that I played well against strong players, but not stable enough against weak ones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is quite clearly demonstrated by one of the games of the 2nd round, where kostya200300, who was then in the very last place, beat me at 0!</font></font><br>

<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Self-blasting</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Like most participants, I was not enthusiastic about the possibility of self-explosion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This greatly increased the already considerable random factor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it was clear that one could not do without it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, I did not really want to do this, and I put it off until the last day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This technique is quite simple, if we are standing on the ground, the enemy is in a radius of the explosion and we have enough (maximum two) mines, then we put mines and shoot at the bottom. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I put an additional condition that after the explosion I get a clear advantage, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">either immediately win, or kill more opponents than their own. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I thought that since I aspire to a high place, then changing one on one is unprofitable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, it's like in chess, if you play to win, then exchanging everything in a row is unprofitable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is how I sent my warriors endowed with kamikaze skills to the final battle.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The final</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As I already wrote, the rating only speaks of the balance of power with the closest competitors, and I did not have stability against weaker rivals. In this regard, the elimination of the participants to the finals played a mess for me. On the other hand, the massive spread of terrorist ideology on the last day introduced a further spread in the distribution of forces. In short, despite the confident leadership in the ranking, there wasn‚Äôt any confidence in the final, there was only hope. After the first half of the final, it became clear that the main struggle will be between me and Ivan Tyamgin. I led to a small number of points, while the rest were far behind. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the break, I </font></font><s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dawdled</font></font></s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">picking up self-detonation - something was fixed (it turned out that mines should not be placed at the top of the stairs), he added some countermeasures against detonation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And repaired the simulation, because so far mine clung to the corner.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The beginning of the second part of the final round was successful for me, the gap began to grow slowly and reached a maximum of about 20 points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I even relaxed a little and instead of refreshing the results page every 3 minutes, I started playing chess on the phone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I looked again, the gap was already about 7 points and then quickly rolled to the 1st. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wonder what they give for 2nd place? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1 hour to the end, again there is a gap. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">30 minutes, the gap is catastrophically reduced. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10 minutes - just 3 points! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One minute ... victory seems! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vanya lost to me only 3 points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is within random scatter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rest are 50 points or more behind.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About funny bugs</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Already after the final, I noticed that in some games my units behave strangely - they do not avoid bullets when, it seemed, they could, and even, as if, specially catch them. It turned out that during the break in the final, I made a mistake - when it was determined whether the enemy could blow me up, it was necessary to calculate which of mine was in the radius of the explosion. Here I mixed up the coordinates of my own and another's unit and mistakenly assumed that the explosion would occur where I am, and thus guaranteed to fall into the radius of the explosion. The real explosion was already considered from the right point, so in the simulation the enemy itself could explode away from me. Usually it just added a big constant to the estimate, but it didn't really affect anything. However, if the enemy did not have enough mines to blow me up, it turned out that it was </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">profitable for</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> me </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to catch a bullet</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">so that the enemy already had enough mines, and I got the very addition to the assessment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps it was due to lack of sleep, or a drunk can of beer, but in fact, mistakes always happen.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conclusion</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The game, although not as spectacular as football, was no less interesting from the point of view of strategy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The threshold entry was relatively low, and this favorably affected the number of participants. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I received a lot of emotions during the month of the championship, both joy and emotions, and for this I am grateful to the organizers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I also thank all the participants, especially Vanya Tyamgina, for not making me bored in the finals.</font></font></div>
