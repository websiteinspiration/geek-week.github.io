      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/490044/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The topic of implementing CRM systems has been repeatedly covered on Habr√© in many articles, which are mainly written by representatives of development companies or integrators of CRM solutions, the purpose of which is to sell your services to you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This article was written by a customer representative and may be of interest to medium or large businesses as a view from the other side. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Below there will be no names of products or companies, but only a thesis summary of experience, acquaintance with which will probably be of benefit to you.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do you want to get from CRM?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before you begin implementing CRM, give yourself the answer to this question. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The absolute fact that CRM is not a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù and implementation for the sake of implementation, driven by the desire to get a system with many functions, is likely to lead to failure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Implementing CRM should be a goal to achieve measurable and understandable business goals on time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, ‚Äúby the end of the first quarter after the introduction of CRM, the order processing speed should increase by 50%‚Äù, the goal is much better than ‚Äúour competitors use CRM, we cannot afford to lag behind - we are introducing‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only knowing exactly what you want, you can get what you need.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Preparing for system selection</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Do you know exactly how your business works? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would seem a paradoxical question, because as a CEO, you may not know how his company works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To implement CRM, you need to understand not only the whole, but also the particular, in all details. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The larger the company, the often more complex and confusing the business processes occurring in it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Knowing your business processes is the foundation of successful implementation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before you start choosing to understand your business, build a detailed diagram of your business processes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The construction and analysis of this scheme will help to identify additional system limitations or bottlenecks, the elimination of which may be the goal of a whole range of measures to improve the efficiency of your business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Implementing CRM is just one of the possible activities that you need to be sure of.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">System selection</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Start with a market analysis, make a list of potentially interesting solutions for you, it can include several dozen positions, and then consider each of these solutions separately.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the criteria for choosing from a variety of ready-made CRM systems may be the answer to the question: ‚ÄúSolution‚Äú N ‚Äù‚Äú out of the box ‚Äùhow much corresponds to our business processes and the goal of implementation?‚Äù. Proceed solely from your own needs, and not from the potential capabilities of the system and the likelihood of a successful choice will increase significantly. The solution in question can have many amazing functions that you will never get to use or maybe they simply are not applicable in your business, but if this solution requires a long and substantial development for your current processes, then this is an occasion to think about something else supplier. If the system can be configured and / or dispensed with with minor modifications for your current business processes, then add the supplier to the ‚Äúshort list‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Do not succumb to the tricks of marketers and do not chase well-known brands, for a company with hundreds of thousands of customers, you are only a fraction of a percent of the income and it is naive to expect that it will quickly fix not massive but critical bugs for you or introduce the function you need to the core. Yes, and you will work with a well-known brand through an integrator who can justify his incompetence with the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of the system core. Choosing a less promoted brand is more likely that they will want to hear you and that your problem will be solved in principle.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If all the systems in question make you feel somewhat dissatisfied, maybe you should compromise? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or start to create your own system? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To build your system, your company must have its own IT competencies and a willingness to start recruiting new specialists at a market price, and many articles have been written about the complexity of selecting qualified personnel in the IT field.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">CRM implementation is expensive</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this is not only a license and payment for the services of a provider. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you find a supplier, you will at least have to allocate a Product Manager who can devote all his working time to CRM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This person should understand the business and have sufficient authority to make decisions, which will avoid hours of meetings devoted to choosing the color of buttons and the layout of interface elements.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the implementation of CRM requires significant improvements, then add the cost of testing specialists, but we will not put the solution in production without making sure of its quality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if you do not have formalized business processes, then add the cost of analysts, in any case you have to describe the BP. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you need complex integrations with existing systems, then this is also the cost of a system architect and developers, because you provide the API. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If cloud solutions do not suit you, then get ready for spending on server infrastructure, in some cases we can talk about millions of rubles.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conclusion</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Remember that battles are won even before they begin, and the more carefully you analyze the existing solutions, the more detailed your BP description, the more detailed your technical specifications, the less risks there will be in increasing the terms and cost of the project. Separately, I want to note that you should not expect the highest professionalism from representatives of the supplier, they most likely have the same personnel as everywhere else, therefore we set tasks in detail and clearly, we fix all agreements in writing and carefully check the result.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you have to integrate CRM with various non-standard systems, and the boxed solution requires significant improvements, then the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating your own highly specialized solution is not as bad as it seems initially, but only on condition that the company already has experience in developing IT solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, you get a ‚Äúbicycle‚Äù, but you can ride on it, not fall, gradually introducing the necessary functionality and flexibly adapt to changing business conditions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you can get by with a standard solution, with really small improvements, and not with an implementation cycle of several years, then a standard solution is the best option.</font></font></div>
