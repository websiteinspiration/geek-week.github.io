<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you believe Einstein‚Äôs theory of simplicity, the main indicator of understanding the subject is the ability to explain it as simply as possible, then in this post I will try to explain as simple and detailed as possible the effect of just one detail of the new standard, which for some reason even the Wi-Fi Alliance considers not worthy of mention in the infographic about the new features of Wi-Fi 6, although it, as we will soon see together, is very important and noteworthy. Here, not everything is deep enough and certainly not comprehensive (because such an elephant is difficult to eat even in parts), but I hope that we will all learn something new and interesting from our verbal exercises.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The same 802.11ax, which we have been waiting for from day to day for at least the second year, carries a lot of new and surprising. Before anyone who wants to tell something about him, there is always a choice: either arrange overview jumps on their heads, mentioning a bucket of abbreviations and acronyms, trying not to get bogged down in complex mechanisms under the hood of each of them, or wrap up an hour-long report about one thing , most pleasing to the author. I will venture to go even further: Most of my post will be devoted not even to the new!</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, for more than twenty years, part of the wireless data transmission networks has been built according to a heap of 802.11 family standards, and, like any self-respecting speaker, I would have to restore the timeline of the entire event chain, which gave the world billions of compatible devices with one another - but As a respectful author, I risk not doing it all the same. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, something should be reminded of each other. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All Wi-Fi iterations put reliability at the forefront, but not maximizing throughput. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This follows from the medium access mechanism (CSMA / CA), which is not optimal from the point of view of squeezing the last kilobits per second from the transmission medium (more details about the imperfection of the world as a whole and wifi in particular can be read in the article of my former colleague</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">skhomm</font></font></a><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here are little shoes</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ), but incredibly tenacious in almost any environment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, you can violate almost all the basics of designing Wi-Fi networks - and in such a network there will still be data exchange! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The whole mechanism by which Wi-Fi network clients are able to transmit and / or receive their portions of data is aimed at ensuring that in English it is called a word with a hard-to-translate technocracy fluter, robustness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The entire layer of smeared on top of modulations, aggregation of frames with data (not quite so, but let it be!) Continues to work after two basic principles of 802.11, which provide this unsurpassed reliability:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhile one speaks, the rest are silent‚Äù;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúEverything but the data is said slowly and clearly.‚Äù</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second point does network bandwidth much more damage than it might seem at first glance. Here's a cool picture illustrating one piece of data sent on a Wi-Fi network:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gh/ce/36/ghce36-hnupgc6t2gr1ufgfskn0.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's see what it means for ordinary people who do not know how many pages in the standard 802.11-2016. The data transfer speed that the system writes in the properties of the wireless network and which marketers of any manufacturer draw on the boxes of access points (well, you probably saw 1.7 Gb / s! 2.4 Gb / s! 9000 Gb / s!), Not only is it peak and maximum at 100% of the time taken by transmission, but it is also the speed at which only the blue part on this beautiful chart will be sent. Everything else will be forwarded at a speed that is called management rate in English (and in Russian, too, because translating such expressions threatens further misunderstanding between the engineers), and which is lower not just at times, but in </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">HUNDREDS</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">time. For example, without any additional settings, the network on 802.11ac, which can work with clients at a channel speed of 1300 Mb / s, transfers all the service information (everything that is not blue on our increasingly scary chart) to a management rate of 6 Mb / s . More than two hundred times slower!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The logical question is - what, excuse me, the date of which month such a harmful idea could even fall into the standard by which billions of devices around the world work? The logical answer is compatibility, compatibility, compatibility! The network on the newest access point should provide the ability to work for ten- and even fifteen-year-old devices, and it is in all these ‚Äúnon-blue‚Äù pieces that the information that slow older devices hear, correctly understand and will not try to transmit during ultra-fast pieces of data, flies their. Robustness requires sacrifice! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now I‚Äôm ready to give everyone who is interested an indispensable tool in order to be horrified by the potential transferred megabytes that are aimlessly lost in modern Wi-Fi - this has become compulsory for study in the involved engineering circles</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The WiFi AirTime Calculator is</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> authored by a Norwegian enthusiast from 802.11 Gjermund Raaen. It is available at </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this link</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - the result of its work looks something like this: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c0/_q/lb/c0_qlb7uqprtkf3zd1hyacn67bk.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Line 1 - the time taken to transmit a data packet with a length of 1512 bytes by an 802.11n device in a channel width of 20 MHz. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Line 2 - the time taken to transmit the same packet by a device with the same antenna formula, but already working according to the 802.11ac standard in a channel with a width of 80 MHz. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How is it that ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù is four times as much ether, the maximum modulation has become more complicated from 64QAM to 256QAM, the channel speed is </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">SIX</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> times </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">greater </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(433 Mb / s instead of 72 Mb / s), and 25% of the ether busy time is gained by force? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Compatibility and the two principles of 802.11, remember?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, how can such injustice and wastefulness be corrected - we ask ourselves, as probably every IEEE working group asking to create a standard asked itself? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Several logical paths come to mind:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Speed ‚Äã‚Äãup data transfer in the green piece of the graph. </font></font></i></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is done at the output of each standard, because large numbers look beautiful on the boxes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In practice, as we just noticed, it gives a final increase - even if we accelerate the link speed to one hundred thousand million gigabits in a nanosecond, all other parts of the graph will not go anywhere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is why I recommend skipping paragraphs that mention megabits per second in all stories about all new 802.11 standards.</font></font></li>
<li><b><i>    .</i></b> ,      ,     ‚Äú-‚Äù (,  ‚Äú-‚Äù,        ),      50%     ‚Äî ,         ,    ,         CWNA :) :     ,    ,    . ,       802.11,        !</li>
<li><b><i>        .</i></b>    ,      . ,    ,    802.11n         .    , , -,        (,    Voice over Wi-Fi), -,        (-             ,    ,   &gt;500 ‚Äú‚Äù       .  ,      ,         -   !). </li>
<li><b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Violate the first of two principles of 802.11, starting to speak when someone else speaks. </font></font></i></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here, in fact, 802.11ax comes to the rescue.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How great, finally, in my story about Wi-Fi 6, I got to Wi-Fi 6 itself! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are still reading this, then you are either obliged to do this for some reason, or you are really interested. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, even though 802.11ax inherits a huge part of the previous developments of the entire 802.11 family (and not only, by the way - some cool things appeared in general in 802.16, aka WiMAX), something in it is still fresh and original. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Usually such a picture is available on these words, available on the Wi-Fi Alliance website:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oa/3u/hk/oa3uhk-p9edkxkni5vxbm4cl58m.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As I made a reservation from the very beginning, well enough, within the framework of one readable article, we will be able to consider only one of these key points, or rather, none of the ones in the picture (such a surprise!). I‚Äôm sure that you have already read a million fluent descriptions of each of these eight key elements, but I will continue my tiringly long story about what follows from OFDMA - about multiple access to the environment (MU-access control), which, as we see, I didn‚Äôt get to infographics at all. But completely in vain!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Multiple access is something without which dividing a channel into subcarriers is completely meaningless. Why try to look at different pieces of the spectrum if there is no mechanism capable of forcing customers of the new Wi-Fi 6 network to violate one of the rules that are unshakable up to this point and start talking at the same time? And, of course, such a mechanism simply had to appear - and reduce the impact of the ‚Äúlong‚Äù problem in comparison with official information. How? Yes, it‚Äôs very simple: let the ‚Äúslow‚Äù, service part be sent as before, but the ‚Äúfast‚Äù part, in which the data goes directly, we will send simultaneously from several (or several) devices on command! It looks something like this:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f1/e6/tq/f1e6tqxucncm81rkzufetkikbki.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It looks complicated, but in its essence it‚Äôs easy to explain: an access point, using a special frame that is understandable to all (not even Wi-Fi 6!) Devices, reports that it is ready to transmit data at the same time STA1 and STA2. Since the ‚Äútitle‚Äù of this frame is completely understandable even to very, very old clients, they make the correct conclusion that the broadcast will be busy for some time transmitting information to other network clients, and begin to count the time until the end of this period (in fact, as always on Wi -Fi). But the STA1 and STA2 devices understand that now they will be transferred data in a new way, at the same time, to each on their own piece of the channel, and they will answer the access point at the same time, and then they will simultaneously confirm the frame reception (each with its own piece of data!) , and the medium is freed again.From bottom to top, this works in much the same way:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i0/9r/2x/i09r2xoiqhaktuk6jakrkookrlw.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main and striking difference is the access point, and in this situation it informs the stations that can speak simultaneously when to start transmission using a special frame, which is called Trigger. This, in fact, is a new ‚Äútrigger‚Äù of the whole mechanism of multiple simultaneous access to the environment, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the most important innovations ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù of the new standard. It is in it that clients receive a ‚Äúschedule‚Äù of how to share one frequency channel between them; it is in it that clients simultaneously inform the access point that they received their chunks of data and were able to parse them. In it, the access point notifies everyone who can "speak" at the same time, about the beginning of data transfer - in it the access point also starts sending the required data to it. The new Trigger frame mechanism, in fact,and allows you to reduce the irrational use of airtime employment - and as effectively as many customers can use it and correctly perceive!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now let us formulate the main points that follow from all this long story and claim to be TL; DR: </font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Access points of the new 802.11ax standard, even relying on just one of the many innovations, will begin to increase the total bandwidth of the entire network from the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">second</font></font></b>   !       ,    ,     (      ,        ,  ,  ,    ‚Äú‚Äù  ,      - ‚Äú   ‚Äù    )      .         Wi-Fi ‚Äî          ,           ‚Äî     .</li>
<li>   ,        ,     ‚Äî       ,    20   ,        . -   ‚Äú‚Äù management rates ( -  ,   ), -     ,         ,     .     <i>  </i>.</li>
<li>    Wi-Fi 6   .   ,      ,     ‚Äú‚Äù  .      ‚Äî  TWT      .      ‚Äú ‚Äù     ,       , ,                ,    -   ‚Äî     ‚Äú‚Äù. ,         ,  ,  ,             .       ,             ‚Äî ,                .  ‚Äî  !</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The transition from Wi-Fi 5 to Wi-Fi 6 is as revolutionary and important as the transition from 802.11g to 802.11n. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then we got multi-threaded and ‚Äúpayload‚Äù aggregation - now we get simultaneous access to the environment and finally working MU-MIMO and Beamforming (firstly, as we know, this is almost the same thing; secondly, the discussion ‚Äú why MU-MIMO in 802.11ac was invented, but could not get to work ‚Äùis the topic of a separate large article :)). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Both 802.11n and Wi-Fi 6 work in both bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), in contrast to the ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù predecessors - truly, ‚Äúsix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe new four!‚Äù</font></font></li>
