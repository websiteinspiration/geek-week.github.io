      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/505508/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More recently, innovations in the automotive industry revolved around increasing engine power, then increasing efficiency, and at the same time, aerodynamics were improved, the level of comfort and the appearance of vehicles were refined. Now, the main locomotives for moving the automotive industry into the future are hyperconnectivity and automation. When it comes to the car of the future, unmanned vehicles come to mind first of all, but tomorrow the automobile industry will be marked not only by unmanned technologies.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the main factors determining the transformation of cars is their equipment with network capabilities, in other words, their connectivity, which opens the way for remote updates, predictive maintenance, improving driving safety and protecting data from cyber threats. The cornerstone of connectivity, in turn, is the collection and storage of data.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/ew/nw/rrewnwlqxp19jmr7wtamxm2vmwe.jpeg"><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, the expansion of the car‚Äôs network capabilities has made driving more enjoyable, but this is based on the collection, processing and generation of a huge amount of data by the connected car. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">forecasts</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> voiced last year </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, over the next ten years, unmanned vehicles will learn to generate so much information that it will require more than 2 TB, that is, much more space than now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is not the limit - as the technology develops further, the figure will only grow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on this, equipment manufacturers should ask themselves how, under such conditions, they can effectively respond to needs associated with a significant increase in data volume.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How will the architecture of unmanned vehicles develop?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Further improvement of functions such as the management of data generated by unmanned vehicles, object detection, map navigation and decision-making, largely depends on the success of machine learning and artificial intelligence models. The task of car manufacturers is understandable: the more perfect the machine learning models become, the better the users will have an impression of the ride.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, a change in the architecture of unmanned vehicles takes place under the banner of optimization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More and more rarely, manufacturers are opting for an extensive network of microcontrollers that are installed for the needs of each particular application, preferring instead to install one large processor with serious computing power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is such a transition from many automotive microcontrollers (MCUs) to one central MCU that will most likely be the most serious change in the architecture of automobiles of the future.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Transfer storage function from car to cloud</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Data from unmanned vehicles can be stored both directly on board, if their operational processing is needed, and in the cloud, which is more suitable for in-depth analysis. Data routing depends on their function: there is data that the driver needs immediately, for example, information from motion sensors or location data from a GPS system, in addition, based on them, the automaker can draw important conclusions and, based on them, continue to work on improving the ADAS driver assistance system.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the Wi-Fi coverage area, sending data to the cloud is economically justified and technically simple, but if the car is in motion, the only available option may be a 4G connection (and in the future, 5G). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if the technical side of data transmission over a cellular network does not raise serious questions, its cost can be incredibly high. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this reason, many unmanned vehicles will have to be left for some time near the house or in some other place where they can be connected to Wi-Fi. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a much cheaper option for uploading data to the cloud for subsequent analysis and storage.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5G role in the fate of connected cars</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Existing 4G networks will still remain the main communication channel for most applications, however, 5G technology can become the main catalyst for the further development of connected and autonomous cars, giving them the opportunity to communicate almost instantly with each other, with buildings and infrastructure (V2V, V2I, V2X )</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Autonomous cars cannot function without being connected to the network, and 5G is the key to quickly connecting and reducing the delay time for the benefit of future drivers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A higher connection speed will reduce the time it takes for the vehicle to collect data, due to which the vehicle can almost instantly respond to sudden changes in traffic or weather conditions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The arrival of 5G will also mark the progress in the development of digital services for the driver and passengers, which will enjoy the trip even more, and, accordingly, will increase the potential profit for the providers of these services.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Data security: in whose hands are the keys?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is clear that autonomous cars must be protected by the latest cybersecurity tools. According to a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">recent study</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , 84% of respondents from automotive engineers and IT professionals expressed concern that automakers did not have time to respond to ever-increasing cyber threats. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To ensure the integrity of the client and his personal data, all components of the connected vehicles - from hardware and software inside the machine to connecting to the network and the cloud - must guarantee the highest level of security. The following are some measures that will help automakers ensure the safety and integrity of data used by unmanned vehicles.</font></font><br>

</ol><br>
<h4>  </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To fulfill all critical tasks, the central vehicle data storage system must work reliably. But how can car manufacturers guarantee the implementation of these tasks if the system crashes? One way to prevent incidents in the event of a failure of the main system can be to back up data in a duplicate data processing system, however, this option is incredibly expensive to implement.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, some engineers went the other way: they are working on creating backup systems for individual machine components involved in providing an unmanned driving mode, in particular brakes, steering, sensors and computer microcircuits. Thus, a second system appears in the car, which without a mandatory backup of all data stored in the car in the event of a critical equipment malfunction can safely stop the car on the side of the road. Since not all functions are really vital (in an emergency, you can do, for example, without an air conditioner or radio), this approach, on the one hand, does not require creating a backup of non-critical data, which means lower costs, and, on the other hand, everything still provides a safety net in case of system failure.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As the project of unmanned vehicles develops, the entire evolution of transport will be built around data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By adapting machine learning algorithms to process the huge amounts of data that autonomous vehicles depend on, and implementing reliable and working strategies to ensure safety and protect them from external threats, manufacturers will at some point be able to develop a car that would be safe enough to ride on digital roads of the future.</font></font></div>
