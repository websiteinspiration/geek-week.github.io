My name is Alexander, I am the head of index.art. We are engaged in the development and promotion of sites. Including in our portfolio there are quite a lot of online stores. They say that online sales are growing on quarantines. We decided to take several of our customers from various industries and figure out their real-life example of how sales are growing or not growing at this difficult time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In total, three companies were selected. These are different areas, but they have a similar structure: a retail online store operates on the basis of a wholesale distributor. In these cases, it is possible to compare online sales on the site with offline sales.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fk/cc/yg/fkccygthp2gtrcaklexdisfbmua.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For obvious reasons, we can only show a relative change in sales, but for our tasks this is quite enough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The charts below show all online sales made through all channels: orders on the website, in an online consultant, in instant messengers, by phone, and in two of three cases via marketplaces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost all channels of attraction were used to generate online sales: SEO, context, social networks, price aggregators, etc. The set of specific tools on various projects could slightly differ, but this is not so important.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Baby products (mainly toys)</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Federal distributor "Marker Toy". There is its own retail chain Kroshka Antoshka and the online store kroshka-antoshka.ru. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">April growth is more than 2.5 times</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
. Marketplaces are not used on this project. More precisely, the company sells its goods through Ozone, but due to accounting features, these sales do not fall into the retail unit, but are considered wholesale sales and are not taken into account on the chart. In two other projects, there is sales through Ozone in sales volume. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
March growth is due to some seasonality in this area.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Moreover, all offline stores of its own network have been closed since the end of March (as well as competitors). Obviously, there was a transfer of orders from offline to online. The company was ready for this, had a working website, debugged advertising campaigns and picked up this flow of demand. It is clear that to do this quickly from scratch would be impossible.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Did online sales growth offset the closure of offline points? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Obviously not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Offline has always been a great addition to the site (or vice versa). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The chain of stores was used both as additional points of delivery and as a place where you could see and feel the goods alive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, sales of the online store sometimes suffered, because after the order on the website, the consultant in the store could convince the buyer to take something else or did a resale, and then the entire order was canceled and recorded by the seller in the store, but in general the company only benefited from this.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Electronics</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The distributor of mobile phones and other digital gadgets is McTrade. There is a retail online store sotomania.ru. There are no private offline retail outlets, but there is a large core business in wholesale distribution. The share of online retail sales in total sales is not large, but has a significantly higher margin. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More than 2 times growth in April</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this case, the growth in March is due to the fact that we connected the company to Ozone. In general, in the field of electronics sales, Ozone is a very difficult channel. Traditionally, there are very small margins on this topic, which Ozone (and other marketplaces) in some cases completely eat up with their commissions. If we add consumer extremism here, when buyers place a return order, replacing the contents with a non-working product, and Ozone does not even try to deal with it and transfers all the losses to the supplier, frequent refusals to receive the goods, because they bought it cheaper in another place, the need to ship with of his warehouse 7 days a week, without days off, etc., the site becomes not very attractive. On the other hand, there is a large audience and good volumes. In general, our client did not dare to go to Ozone for a long time,but in March, either we had a hunch, or the stars agreed so, but we convinced them and got some of the product lines where it allowed us to make marginality. And it gave a good growth.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since the company does not have its own offline retail, we are not talking about ‚Äúcannibalism‚Äù of its sales. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only the sales volumes of competitors were consumed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Did the growth in online offset the wholesale drawdown? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, because, as I already said, the share of retail sales in this company is not large, and wholesale customers, as a rule, are offline stores. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, we are pleased that our work, obviously, gave the client a tangible plus.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Cosmetics</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Distributor of professional cosmetics company "El". The main directions are means for caring for the head and hands (hair and nails). The company is an official distributor of such brands as Wella, Londa, ORLY, OPI and others. There is a retail and wholesale online store colibrium.ru. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">April growth of more than 4 times!</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Where does this growth come from? This is due to the specifics of the company. The main sales of the wholesale distributor were based on direct deliveries through sales representatives to beauty salons, barbershops and professional retail stores. All of them closed simultaneously. Nevertheless, private craftsmen continued to work on their client base at home and began to order materials on the site.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
March growth is also associated with access to Ozone and some seasonality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in April, in order to compensate for the growth of Ozone commissions, it was necessary to make prices on this site higher than on the site, but sales did not decrease. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, all other channels have grown proportionally. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite the more than 4-fold increase in sales on the site, the drop in offline sales did not compensate for this, because almost the entire customer base was instantly closed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But despite this, I must thank the client for the fact that at such a difficult time for themselves, they continued to pay us for our work day in and day out and did not even ask for discounts or installments, like many others. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although they have developed, probably one of the most difficult situations.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">General conclusions</font></font></h2><br>

<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the current realities of the fast online sales channels can only be called marketplaces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But with them everything is also not so simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, geography. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can fully work with all the major marketplaces only if you have a warehouse in Moscow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regional sellers are much more difficult, although, of course, there are always options. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, the connection itself is also quite laborious, you need to go through the moderation of the company, goods, automate the synchronization of prices and availability. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thirdly, you need to be prepared for the fact that the market place will take the lion's share of your margin, and there are already competitors on your site with a probability of 99.9%.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All of the above, of course, applies to companies that sell goods. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With services, everything is significantly different.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There remains a very important question: how will online sales behave after lifting restrictive measures? Will everyone return to what was or, as everyone loves to say, "the world will never be the same." On the one hand, a turning point has occurred in people's minds, similar to what it was in 2008-2009. Then people realized that you can go find the goods (usually equipment) in the store, and then buy it cheaper on the Internet. And there has been a rapid growth in online stores. Now many have realized that you can not feel in the store, but immediately buy on the Internet. Many bought shoes and clothes online for the first time, someone ordered products from a supermarket, etc.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my opinion, of course, the share of online purchases will gradually grow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quarantines accelerated this process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But with the opening of stores, online sales will gradually decline. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I bought groceries for the first time in a supermarket in 2003. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was certainly interesting, but not very convenient: there is no quality control of meat, fruits, vegetables, shelf life, etc. When ordering products online, they call you 10 times, say that there is something missing, offer to replace, it is not comfortable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since then, little has changed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shoes and clothes are best measured before purchase, no matter what standard size you have, etc. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I believe that it will be interesting to look at the sales volumes for these projects in June-July, so I hope "to be continued."</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PPS</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A month before the epidemic, I met with the largest shopping center in Yekaterinburg, Greenwich, and invited them to launch a joint project to create a marketplace for their tenants. I made a presentation, laid out on the shelves the arguments that it would give them, but all my arguments were broken up by the response of the owners and the management: ‚ÄúWe are fighting online, and you are offering us a marketplace to do.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A month later, all the shopping centers were closed. If they had a working marketplace now, it would not be so painful. And perhaps they would also have taken away a share from other shopping centers. It is clear that launching a marketplace in a month is not realistic, but this is not about that. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seems to me that fighting online is pointless. This is something that cannot be defeated, but can be led. And we are very good at doing this.</font></font></div>
