Life is full of contradictions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even light cannot determine who it is - a particle or a wave. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the world of software development, contradictions between the actors are a car and a small cart. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's look at a couple - a developer and a development manager (this can be a project manager, technical manager, team leader). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As it turns out, these two often look at things differently and generally tend in different directions.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/j_/y2/kij_y2lk7u5gpy2jiljw8rbdofq.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What the developer wants</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone wants a different thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But since we cannot do without generalizations, we take a middle-level developer spherical in a vacuum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He is moderately lazy, moderately curious, and he generally likes his profession. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He would only have a softer time frame, better processes, more interesting tasks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How does he want to develop? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But like this:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learn new technologies</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Solve more interesting problems.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Participate in new projects</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fewer non-development activities</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make decisions yourself</font></font></li>
</ul><br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, his manager wants to:</font></font></h4><br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So that the developer knows the technologies used well</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So that the developer copes well with the tasks: with the proper quality and on time</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That the developer was responsible and always completed what he undertook</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the developer to give adequate assessments to the tasks</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So that the developer has an understanding of the needs of the business and the product as a whole</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the developer to report problems in a timely manner</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Want to know how to compromise? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Welcome to cat.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So what we have. There is a complete contradiction in interests. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The developer wants to learn new things, and the manager wants him to be able to use familiar tools well. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The developer wants to solve interesting problems, and the manager has a bag of ordinary tasks that someone should do. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The developer wants to participate in new projects, and the manager needs someone to support existing ones. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The developer does not want to do anything other than development, and the manager needs the code to be documented, the development process to be transparent and manageable, to fulfill the plans, issue releases, etc. To do this, he asks for assessments, conducts stand-ups, retrospectives, and forces him to plan his activities.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The developer wants to make decisions on his own (he knows how to do it right), and the manager demands that he be informed of the identified problems so that he can control the decision. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is not surprising that many development managers have a bad reputation among their developers - they do not allow you to do what you want, but rather, they force you to do what makes you sick.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Causes</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The reason in my opinion is very simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The developer and his manager have different goals. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The goal of the developer is to be more in demand on the labor market. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The goal of the leader is to deliver the project on time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And yet, in spite of such radical differences, it is possible to achieve a compromise that suits both sides. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's try to understand in more detail.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Developer</font></font></h2><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learn new technologies</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is really interesting and inspiring. At the initial stage of becoming a specialist, it is useful to have a broad view of the industry and understand what there are generally opportunities for development. However, over time, the quantity should turn into quality. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I don’t know about you, but I am often wary of a developer’s resume (with 2-4 years of experience), which lists dozens of languages, frameworks and libraries. This may be a signal that a person was doing a little of everything, but does not know anything deeply (although there are exceptions). It is preferable to meet a person who does not know much, but knows for sure. And this requires significant practical experience in applying the technology. Then there will be an understanding of its subtleties and boundaries of application, and this is extremely important.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thus, it is important and necessary to study new technologies, but it is highly desirable that real practice be behind this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if you are developing a pet-project, make sure that the technology is not used for show, but really solves the business problem.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Solve more interesting problems.</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think everyone is familiar with the concept of “routine”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nobody wants to do the same thing all the time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, there is a very important detail. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is unfair to want new interesting tasks if you barely manage old uninteresting ones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any skill has steps, and you can not jump over them - sooner or later it will lead to a painful fall. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, everything is like in a computer game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To move to a new level, you need to pass the previous ones well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before demanding interesting tasks from the manager, learn to solve current problems quickly and efficiently, then it will become obvious that you deserve more.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Participate in new projects</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Obviously. Quite a few people are enthusiastically engaged in supporting the project on a regular basis. Correcting bugs of their own and their comrades while they are developing something new is a shame. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But after all, it is on support that an understanding of the needs of the business is often acquired, which is vital for any project. The developer learns to look at his software through the eyes of the user - and this is one of the most valuable skills for the programmer. In addition, the ability to understand existing code appears, carefully refactor it, without breaking the entire system. These skills will be useful not only for support, but also when developing a new project - do not repeat past mistakes, maintain the code base in decent condition, and deal with technical debt.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Do not refuse to support the projects that you developed - this is an invaluable experience that can significantly accelerate your career.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fewer non-development activities</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are many developers who consider writing documentation, planning meetings, retrospectives, communicating with the customer as a waste of time. The main thing is to write code? That everything was neat, beautiful, consistent with the guidelines. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The main thing is that software does what is required of it - solve business problems. In addition, it is highly desirable that the development meet deadlines and budgets. If not, it is entirely possible that our ideal code will never work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You need to be clearly aware that for any complex development, you need a plan, regular synchronization of project participants (including the customer), quality documentation and other things that are not code writing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you want to be an important and useful participant in the project, you must have an understanding of the processes that occur on the project and try to follow them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is another useful experience that everyone should have.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Supervisor</font></font></h2><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Know the technologies used to </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
cope with the tasks set: with the right quality and on time</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A leader needs people to rely on. If the task is set, it must be solved. It doesn’t matter if the developer was interested in doing this or if it was a painful routine for him. This happens if you "solve problems as they become available" and "live in the present." But in order to resolve the contradiction, one must act differently. By constantly teaching developers new things and passing them the experience of solving existing problems, we increase their level. Gaining additional knowledge, experience and breadth of mind, they will solve existing problems much faster, and possibly offer an improvement in the process. Such changes, initiated “from below”, are valuable not only for their direct result, but also great motivators for developers to seek and offer new ones.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Allocating time for people to independently learn new technologies or training them, you can get a highly productive and motivated team. </font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Be responsible and always complete what it took</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think everyone will agree that professional programming is primarily about achieving results. To succeed, all project participants must complete their tasks. As a result, it doesn’t matter how cool a developer is technically, if he cannot complete a single task and throws everything halfway. The universal truth posed by great programmers is that the problem should be solved in the simplest possible way. Perhaps this is generally the most important quality of the developer - to be able to solve problems without unnecessary difficulties. To complicate is easy, to simplify is difficult. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I’m not afraid to say that it is such people who are most valued on real projects. Both the leader and the project partners know that you can count on a person that he will not fail.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Education in people of precisely such professional attitudes is one of the important tasks of a leader. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most important mechanism in this matter is the promotion of results. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, you get not just a development team, but a team of like-minded people, each of whom is interested in achieving a common goal.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Give adequate assessments to tasks</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many developers probably had the thought - why do they constantly demand estimates from me, how I will do it, I will do it, anyway, before I finish, nothing will appear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ratings seem like a humiliating control mechanism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, look at this through the eyes of a leader.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As I already wrote, for the project to be successful, the manager must have a plan. There are happy exceptions, but in the general case, without a plan, development turns into chaos. Even if the plan is not implemented on a calendar basis, it still benefits - the manager sees where the problem is and can rearrange it to solve the problem. To make a plan, the leader needs assessments. Even if the developer underestimated or overestimated the task, for the manager this is just an excuse to introduce a correction factor. Thus, having estimates from developers and historically confirmed correction factors, the leader can build a plan close to reality.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Developers often underestimate the need for planning because they focus on development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But as we know, a successful project is not only development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It requires testing, documentation, issuance to the customer, organization of UAT, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The team must act in concert, planning and following the plan provide such consistency. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since the success of the project is also the success of each participant, in order to achieve their own success, the developer must be able to adequately evaluate the tasks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is the leader who must give developers an understanding of all the processes that occur outside of development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Explain the meaning of each action and decision, the importance of planning, communication. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Awareness is the key to success.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Have an understanding of the needs of the business and the product as a whole</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quite often, developers focus on writing code, ignoring the business problem that they solve. Unfortunately, this is characteristic not only for beginners, but also for well-established and titled specialists. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As I already wrote, I consider the solution to business problems to be the main task of programming. Therefore, in a natural way, only one who can effectively solve these problems can be considered a good programmer. To do this, it is vital to clearly understand what is happening in the business that we automate.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thus, the manager’s desire for the developer to understand the needs of the business and consider each task primarily from this point of view (which business task we solve and why) is more than a natural desire. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only in this way can a developer achieve real mastery. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, the real interests of the leader and developer coincide here. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As in the previous paragraph, the duty of the leader is to clearly and clearly explain to the developer what the business needs and why. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, it is necessary to convey a simple truth - the one who can delve into the subject area and solve a specific problem is appreciated, and not the one who simply writes beautiful code.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Report problems in a timely manner</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To ensure the success of the project, it is vital for the manager to receive timely information about problems with completing tasks. The developer, on the contrary, often prefers to completely deal with the problem and report it only when all reasonable deadlines have passed. It should be said that the desire to independently understand the problem is always commendable. However, for the benefit of the project, it is necessary to inform the head of the problems that can increase the time for solving the problem, so that he can take this into account in the plan. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The most important skill of the developer is the ability to communicate in a timely and open manner with other project participants. Timely reporting a problem is an important part of communication.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this case, the leader should not immediately rush to solve the problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is wiser to give the developer time to figure it out for himself, make the necessary decisions and present the result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This will give him confidence in his abilities, the habit of relying on himself and at the same time relieve himself from the fear of reporting problems in a timely manner.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Summarize. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to combine the interests of the developer and his leader?</font></font></h2><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To the developer</font></font></h3><br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The success of a project is the success of each of its participants. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every successful project is a step forward in your career. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At any interview, you will gain much more points if you have successfully completed projects behind your back.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Solving business problems is the main goal of development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the project failed, it doesn’t matter how good the architecture was and how beautiful the code was.</font></font></li>
