<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Nomination "Hospitality" </font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wg/5g/4p/wg5g4p58xwwzh9zwrcuedfah8vc.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2014, a lovely elderly woman came to a prison in South Dakota, USA, who introduced herself as a medical inspector. She told the staff that she had to check the conditions of the prisoners and the observance of sanitary and hygienic standards in the office premises. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The woman was greeted cordially and taken to all the offices where she demanded access. The guards were not even embarrassed by the request to let her go to the IT systems control center and the server room - supposedly to see if there was mold there. At the same time, she was allowed to take a phone with her and take a photo, and in addition often left alone.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, Rita Strand (the so-called “inspector”) freely collected information about the entire infrastructure of the prison: access points, PCs, physical security measures. And she hacked into all the computers that got in the way by connecting USB Rubber Ducky to them to intercept data. She even managed to get to the PC of the head of the prison, who himself (!) Invited the woman to his office. Rita took 45 minutes to do everything.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The funny thing is that Rita Strand had absolutely no hacker skills. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She worked all her life in catering and never participated in “spy” affairs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And to break into the security system of the prison, instead of her son, information security expert John Strand, who was supposed to arrange a pentest, volunteered. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was he who supplied her with “USB ducks” and all the instructions, but he did not expect that penetration would be so simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">shared</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> his </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">story</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> at a specialized conference six years later, without revealing the name and location of the prison. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Presumably, the jailers are still embarrassed.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Nomination "Tinder of the brain" </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The heroes of this story were several dozen soldiers of the Israeli army. All of them made pleasant acquaintances on the net, and then found that they were merging state secrets. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The incident went public this February. It was reported that since the end of 2019, girls began to actively write to soldiers on social networks and dating sites. On the move, they were ready to share piquant photos, however, only in a special secure application (or else they’ll leak into the network!). He was offered to download from the link.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Those who succumbed to persuasion found that their smartphones were starting to behave strangely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Data transmission was activated, outgoing traffic grew, the camera and recorder turned on by themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It soon became clear that the “secret chat” with the photo was malware for remote control of the phone, and the “girls” were Hamas hackers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For several months, they had access to information about the location of affected devices, photos and phone contacts. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Representatives of the Israeli army </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">claim</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that they revealed the scheme almost immediately, but did not respond to observe the situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And supposedly no valuable data flowed to the Palestinian militants, because all the military had been warned about the danger in advance.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Nomination "Rake Dance"</font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7g/oj/au/7gojauwk6tbk2qb1vjaxzuphwe4.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here could be any of probably hundreds of stories about the non-password-free Elastic. Or MongoDB. Or any other database in which users do not set passwords and, in fact, leave information in the public domain. This is indeed one of the most common leakage channels - in 2018, 540 million Facebook accounts went so far (then the social network trusted Mexican analysts from Cultura Colectiva, and the contractor did not protect the server). In 2016, information leaked about 80% of Americans with voting rights (this is private data of 198 million people). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But this year the victory in the nomination goes to the Whisper application. It was positioned as “the most reliable place on the Internet”, where users could anonymously share their secret secrets. And then the developers accidentally </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">revealed</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">data of 30 million people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out that Whisper has been storing the archive for all users since 2012. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From a non-password-protected database, the content of “secret” posts leaked to the network. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And these are stories about fears, secret desires, confessions of immoral and criminal acts, intimate secrets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the main thing is that information about user credentials (nicknames, email and phone numbers associated with them), their age, nationality and location at the last authorization turned out to be in the public domain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes geodata was enough to establish a specific residential area and workplace. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About 1.3 million compromised accounts belonged to adolescents under 15 years of age.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Nomination "I do not see, then it wasn’t"</font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u2/qf/gk/u2qfgk0u00az9ds8lbgpfmjuosu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the beginning of this year, the Kazakhstani information security company “Center for Analysis and Investigation of Cyber ​​Attacks” </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">reported</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> to the media that it had discovered a major data leak from the information system of the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Persons of all citizens of Kazakhstan and foreigners, in relation to whom administrative affairs have ever been initiated in the republic, were in free access to the network. All their fines, warnings, residential addresses, photographs of violators, license plate numbers and data of their cars. Moreover, access to the information system of the prosecutor’s office turned out to be open from the Internet, any user could edit, delete cases, start new ones. Since the information system is integrated with all services of the electronic government of the country, the internal data of any government agencies may be compromised.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Researchers noted that they contacted the agency several times, but did not achieve a reaction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even after the public disclosure of information about vulnerability, the prosecutor's office of Kazakhstan </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">stands its ground</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : nothing like that, "the data is not available on the Internet in the clear." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Amazing stubbornness.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Nomination "For Information Exhibitionism"</font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/n-/c8/mtn-c8up6pyfawcc7t9mt7hvcry.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A bank clerk from North Carolina, USA, stole more than $ 88,000 from customer accounts. A man withdrew funds from deposits and forged documents to cover his tracks. He managed to crank the scheme at least 18 times, during which time he improved his position well and began to live in a big way. And all would be fine if I hadn’t decided to boast of success on Facebook and Instagram. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the American page, photos began to appear regularly with packs of cash, expensive alcohol, jewelry, and cars. Photos were popular - in the end, the police became interested in them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By April 2019, it came to court, the American faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of $ 1 million. And the materials from social networks were attached to the case. For example, a post where a man poses against the backdrop of a brand new Mercedes-Benz - a photograph and a check for $ 20,000, which he made as a prepayment for the car, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">became one of the evidence of the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> prosecution. </font></font><br>
<br>

 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A similar story happened in Colombia with the head of the internal shipping control service. Omar Ambuel received an official salary of $ 3,000 per month. At the same time, his daughter, who lived in Miami and kept a modest ice cream shop, led a truly luxurious lifestyle. On her Instagram regularly appeared photos with purchases from expensive brands, driving new Lamborghini and Porsche, on vacation from luxury resorts.</font></font><br>
 <br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The trouble overtook when police appeared among the subscribers of the secular diva. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through a girl, they went to her father and asked him a reasonable question: is such a Dolce Vita affordable for the family of an ordinary civil servant? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The authorities believe that the official created a criminal network in the Colombian port and received multimillion-dollar bribes for smuggling. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In April 2019, Ambuil, his wife and daughter were </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">arrested</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - just in an expensive resort. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What’s called, thanks to the pictures for the tip.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. Nomination "Pizza as a weapon of fate"</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not only savvy thieves are pierced on trifles, but also real grandees of cybercrime. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The creator of one of the oldest Quantum Stresser DDoS services, David Bukoski, has been successfully hiding from the authorities since 2012. Only in 2018, his brainchild allowed “putting” about 50 thousand information systems around the world, in total, the service accounted for more than 80 thousand completed orders for cyber attacks. Although in 2018, during the international special operation, the quantumstress [.] Net website was liquidated, law enforcement officers were still looking for ways to reach the owner and tried to establish his identity. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The "cat and mouse" dragged on, David relaxed. In early 2020, he decided to order pizza home and left a contact email on the delivery site ... to which he had once registered his domain.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Previously, the address appeared on the “black lists” of several services that David used to advertise Quantum Stresser and accept payments from customers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the companies stopped the services, he sent them official letters asking them to explain the refusal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So the police were able to find out the real name of the hacker. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the delivery order revealed his home address. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, pizza with bacon and chicken </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">cost</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Bukoski 5 years in prison. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, in 2012, another cybergeny gave out the same order - Yuri Kovalenko, one of the authors of the famous Zeus. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In London, he headed the cell of the “operators” of the botnet and worked quietly, despite the FBI “on the tail”, until he </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">left an</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> online application for delivering lunch directly to his headquarters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So pizza is still a weapon of fate.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. Nomination "I am spinning as I can"</font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/et/vl/zj/etvlzjsxopmzpf___m2h7wukzf0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are people who firmly believe that if you beat a person and then offer him to hire you as a bodyguard, he will gladly agree. It sounds crazy in the scenery of the real world. However, in the virtual world there are still such characters. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, recently, employees of Department “K” of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Vologda Oblast </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">detained the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> unsuccessful “Pentester”. As the investigation established, the man carried out a DDoS attack on the online store of the largest Cherepovets enterprise. The detainee admitted that he specifically loaded the site - he tested it for stability, so that later he could offer the owners his services for protecting against DDoS attacks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are plenty of stories to laugh at. You can recall a fresh incident from Germany where they </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sold</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on eBay</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">laptop with top-secret instructions for the destruction of the state missile defense system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can recall how the officers of the electronic intelligence units of the Israel Defense Forces </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hacked the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> server of the army personnel department to receive additional and extraordinary vacations, including paid accommodation in hotels. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But one may be generally surprised that over the past 4 years, the UK Ministry of Defense </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">has</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> already </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">lost</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> nearly 800 laptops with military secrets. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Kick us in the comments if we missed something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are there more worthy nominees?</font></font></div>
