      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/504488/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The virus and massive self-isolation of the population entailed the forced digitalization of a wide variety of business sectors, medicine, social programs, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some industries that have not been able to adapt to new trends are rapidly collapsing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some are balancing on the verge of loss-making, while some, on the contrary, are growing and developing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The voices of experts are heard louder and louder that our world will no longer be the same. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That even when all the worries subside, we will live in new conditions - more isolated, mobile and technological. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want to speculate about technology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make a prediction of our IT life in the near future, so to speak. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, what and who will be "on horseback".</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remote work and online planning</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Obviously, the number of people wishing to work from home will increase. This is not about freelance, but about remote work. Previously, many could not afford it because of the mass of fears and stereotypes both in their minds and in the minds of leaders. Forced to switch to remote work, both of them were able to really feel all the pros and cons of this format. Surely there are those who "did not enter." But there are other people who like the changes. The opportunity to save on transport and food in a cafe / dining room, the appearance of "extra" time, which used to take to get from home to work and back - these factors will become an important argument when choosing a work format in the future.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the same way, for many it became a discovery of how convenient it is to hold meetings, meetings, meetings through video communication. Not everywhere, but in many companies where my friends work, they have become shorter and less frequent. They speak the case and discuss only important issues. Due to the fact that communication has become a little more complicated, the team becomes independent. Because of the little things, it‚Äôs a shame to organize a video meeting. Leaders who are accustomed to calling on the carpet and personally communicating with subordinates suffer a little. However, they have Zoom and a bunch of other services.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, just Zoom, Hangouts and other video conferencing services are now on the horse. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They were much sneezed for security flaws (for example, the lack of encryption and data transfer on social networks), but continued to use due to the lack of alternatives. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Services took into account errors, issued patches, and are now actively expanding, inventing new chips and actively monetizing them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, there is a demand for videoconferencing from officials. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Look how actively they communicate, isolating themselves in their offices.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">VDI, SaaS</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Once companies go online, they need technologies that ensure the safe work of employees with corporate data. VDI and SaaS already existing on the market came in handy. With their help, you can provide each employee with a fully configured computer with corporate software in a day. And if something happens, everyone can access the familiar desktop and databases at home. Via VPN, of course.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Alternatively, provide employees with a laptop / tablet with configured VDI. Personal workspace, good performance (which is important when working with "heavy" files), the ability to quickly add the right amount of jobs and a high level of security are really important advantages. The advantage of VDI is that the technology allows you to remove part of the load from the IT department. And they already have a hard time, so the introduction of VDI and SaaS is only a plus.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since these technologies are now in high demand, it is expected that they will be finished, diluted with new services and packaged in a new wrapper. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Already now they are used by companies of various levels, ranging from government agencies and ending with small commercial organizations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it is unlikely that all of them will abruptly switch to the usual format of work when the wave of panic subsides and the problem of COVID-19 is resolved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, demand will remain after the end of the quarantine regime. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accordingly, the industry is clearly not going to fade.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dramatic leap in scalability</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The demand for solutions that can quickly scale the IT infrastructure will definitely increase. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember how the government services site was lagging under a ‚Äúparental‚Äù DDoS attack, and how quickly it was possible to solve the problem by providing everyone with a request for a child allowance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, you can call the example clumsy, but similar incidents happened with other sites (I can not help but mention a site where GTA V was handed out for free). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, nobody likes accessibility issues. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we can expect that the number of proposals to ensure the continued availability of resources will increase. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As is the demand for scalable solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In particular, cloudy.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hybrids and multi-clouds</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, about the clouds. A business representing this area is now actively using its winning position, attracting customers with super-beneficial offers. In the long run, the forced transition of companies to the cloud will increase the level of knowledge about these platforms. Accordingly, people will begin to more boldly use cloud solutions, while taking advantage of different service providers. That is, the number of companies implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy will increase. Well, simply because it is really convenient. So cloud providers can pretty rub their shaggy paws.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why not just a cloud, but a hybrid or multi-cloud? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For greater reliability and safety. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If one of the cloud storages suddenly becomes unavailable, you can turn to another. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This guarantees the availability of data and the ability to save information in the event of an emergency.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Smart Systems, Internet of Things</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many countries already have technologies to recognize people's faces in public places. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some even tested the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">system of "trapping"</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> potential carriers of the disease. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are a lot of questions on the observance of human rights, but will these very people be asked? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyway, many are ready to compromise on civil liberties in exchange for alleged security.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Perhaps existing CCTV systems will add new equipment or change functionality to mitigate the possible consequences of future epidemics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New intelligent systems will appear that will monitor crowded places, identifying potential threats. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The question of how these systems will be used will be left out of brackets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù systems, computer vision, IoT received a good impetus for development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And precisely these technologies will be in demand in the future.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Online Learning</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Schools, kindergartens, universities and other institutions are now engaged in distance learning of their wards. Yes, it is difficult. A number of my educated teachers complain about the increased load due to the unusual format. However, while at a young age, it is still better to conduct training in a team (socialization, adaptation, all things), then for older students, online learning will often be more convenient. There is much to argue about where it is more effective to use online learning. It is clear that you cannot teach plumbing in a video call. But foreign languages, design, layout, programming - why not?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seems to me that we should expect an increase in the number of online courses that complement the basic program, as well as full-fledged alternatives to classical education. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps classical education is also being modernized - for example, schoolchildren will be able to listen to a lecture on history, art, physics, astronomy from a famous scientist on video communication. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether it is a recording or real communication is not so important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important that this was very rare before. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now it will be more often.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quantum computers, global computing systems</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Surely you heard the news that a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">network</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> voluntarily created by ordinary people </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to fight against coronavirus has become more powerful than what was considered the world's most powerful supercomputer. Similar associations have happened before, but this time everything turned out really globally. If the project can really help in the fight against the pandemic, then this will open up good prospects for creating software and projects for using the power of computers of users from around the world to solve local problems. The potential of such computing systems is quite large.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The same can be said about quantum computers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Already, much more governments, corporations and organizations are planning to spend a lot of money on developing quantum devices that can give a significant increase in computing speed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if Intel, IBM, HPE, Microsoft, NVIDIA and AMD were doing this before, then in the future we will hear new names. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Will quantum computers benefit? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, if correctly targeted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quantum computing, although not universally applicable, can help solve some problems much faster than supercomputers.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Industry development</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When production stopped in China, everyone hiccuped. Almost all products (electronics, medical equipment, clothing) are made in China. As a result of the current crisis, manufacturers will reassess the risks and begin searching for new locations to locate their plants and factories. Perhaps someone will return to their country or move to India, Malaysia and Indonesia. It is dangerous to store all the eggs in one basket, and the industrialists once again became convinced of the correctness of this statement. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Production processes will also undergo changes. The level of robotization of production will increase. The fewer people involved in the production process, the lower the risk of stopping it in the event of an outbreak of another infection. Remote enterprise management technologies will also become more flexible.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Interestingly, partly the fear of stopping business processes will affect the work of office employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the pandemic, the trend was open space format, where one sneezer could infect all colleagues in the room at once. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps, a return to the cabinet format will follow to increase hygiene and reduce the risks of the rapid spread of pathogenic microorganisms. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Summing up, I want to say that I almost certainly missed something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will be interesting to hear what changes you expect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And do you expect them at all?</font></font></div>
