In the report I want to talk about my own experience in the organic development of a company selling b2b server software without investment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I started by picking just for fun in what I was interested in, then I was ready to give up everything (especially after talking with several mentors and business consultants). </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maxim Lapshin (hereinafter - ML):</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Hello, colleagues! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My name is Maxim Lapshin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am the owner of Erlyvideo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do it almost all my time, I devote all my work 35 hours a day.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How it all began</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I wanted to talk about my experience: how could I, from a simple programmer, without business skills, without the experience of hard work in business, reach the mark of 1 million dollars earned (per year). This is despite the fact that we do not have hosting costs, this is pure entry and earnings. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I want to say that I was ready to close the case in the middle, about my experience of dubious partnership. Also - about what helped me develop, get out of constant hunger and suck on what income. And, actually, like, having no debts and investments (this is a much more expensive debt, as we know), I have reached a million, and what I see on my way to the $ 10 million mark.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/yp/rk/asyprkpwy2rjmq5gszwp4fnzjea.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I worked for a video streaming company. Very good company, very good team, talented people gathered, wonderful tasks. But I did not see what we are doing. I come to work, do something, and who needs it, what is needed - I haven‚Äôt seen all this. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I decided to see how others did it. The world around exists - other people are engaged in video streaming. In Russia in 2009 this was not so much, not so popular. Nevertheless, this story with streaming video over the Internet in the world has been for many years. And I realized that I want to leave ... </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I left work and started making software: I picked up an abandoned IT project, collecting from everyone who wrote a contribution letter (that they no longer care about all this, and they alienate everything-everything-everything ) </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h3>  Erlyvideo 2010 ?</h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my free time, I started making a product called Erlyvideo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now we have the name of the company, and software is called differently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What was the software that I started doing? </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/jd/6f/aljd6fspglh509irsehro3wxnla.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was a very young thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He knew very little about what - a percentage (maybe two) of what we have now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, the core of this software was in opensource. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not knowing, not understanding how software is sold, how it is made ... Especially such a difficult, complicated thing as open source trading. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I left the core in the open source, intuitively believing that this would help the spread.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Opensource</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It helps at first. People are ready to try open source - this is normal for them. They do not have the feeling that this is some kind of thing for which someone is responsible. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For small businesses, open source is extremely expensive. Open source is fun for the big ones (or for services). That service can do open source to attract people to hire. And when you trade software, it‚Äôs really difficult. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The important point is that this forms a freebie feeling. There is such a moment: when you have a commercial product that is closed, then a person from the business can contact you. It is easier to communicate with a person from a business than with an administrator. The admin will not communicate with you when he takes your software. A person from a business will communicate - a simple thing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, the first sales by people were perceived as investments in nowhere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People watched: oh, young software, he was a year old; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">they want some more piece of code (I was selling some additional stuff). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People were afraid of this.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First sales</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How did I get my first sales? It was very difficult! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I did this: I took those functions that competitors in the market did not have. There were other substitutes for my software, or rather, I made substitutes for other products. I made a certain set of functions (like recording a video) - no one else had them, this, in fact, I sold. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ff/il/-u/ffil-uva90pwshfxjnk4iebytao.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It really excites: you yourself went and got money from the market! This is radically different from the situation when the employer paid you a salary. You went, you agreed, transferred the money, and you have an act: you - software, you - money. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the first days it makes sense to keep everything in order. If you register as an IP at the start, then contracts are not so difficult, it is possible. It is better to follow this from the first days, otherwise there will be problems later.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The most important point is that I had no business experience: no understanding, no sales, nothing at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I never wondered who and how it is needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Market capacity - I did not understand at all what these words mean. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I focused only on "live" competitors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I know that there is another software, there is nothing special in it, in terms of functionality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, I can repeat this, and then a question that we will solve locally.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to understand what the market needs?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today, probably, I would start by talking with potential customers. Then I did not understand at all who my clients would be. I found out later, after the fact. This is now called in a fashionable manner Custom Development: you need to try to understand who and where is buying, to find out somehow. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Such advice is very complicated. With most commercial b2b software, figuring out a customer list is difficult. This is hidden information, and the company, as a rule, does not like to talk left and right about the list of its customers, as this is their trade secret. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l3/ui/ym/l3uiym3wo__an4kgrspw9i7jauw.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most importantly, I did not make a product, of course, but software. Let‚Äôs talk with you about what it is. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Software is something that can be downloaded from the site, some kind of program that does something. </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And a product is something that solves problems.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, a product is more than software. Moreover, the product may be without software at all! A product is a set of measures, actions, suggestions, advice, expertise, experience, support in order to convey to someone some kind of business value.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, there is simply a manual for software: software can do this, do this config - you will have something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the product has a story about business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A product is such a thing, to which there goes a certain set of presentations, conversations, a salesperson, something else ... Everything that is around the product is brought to the client and he is told: ‚ÄúDude, drag it into your business, change it, fire someone ‚ÄúAnyway, hire a new person ... Go through all this hemorrhoids and you will have plus some money at the exit.‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, programmers make software, and for the product you need a whole team, people who sell (all these unpleasant people in white shirts with ties). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is about the difference.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conceptual development</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important that I do what I can. Programmer - what is he? He comes to work and sells what he knows how. Well, I can write in Erlang and didn‚Äôt sell it anywhere, I could write in Rails - I sold it. To whom, why is this needed, how does it help some people - without a clue. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And here I had to go through my own self-development, namely conceptual. It consists in the fact that the programmer does what the boss needs. The boss says: "Here is TK for you, do some sort of thing." What this thing is, who needs it - it does not matter. The boss needs! </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vz/s0/6x/vzs06x4l2mjpzs6pgqvsklkk8y0.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Business does what customers need! A good, successful business, of course, and not one that slowly decays or burns money from investors, it is not clear what they are counting on. Moreover, the business does not always understand what its customers need, but this is a different story.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And business transforms what employees do in the company into a product that customers need. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the value of the business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Going to this understanding was very difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you simply work as a programmer and make software that your boss needs, this does not mean that someone else will need this software. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This does not mean that someone, except your boss, can transform the same software into a company's profit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is important because this transition is difficult to make. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps, having left the company and doing what you did in it, it turns out that the company was unique, only she knew how to turn this software into a product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was lucky with that.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Self-attempted flight. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Investments and savings</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Next I left. I was torn between part-time jobs, because I left without a huge ‚Äúpillow‚Äù: during the day 8 hours I worked as an IP, made websites on ‚ÄúRails‚Äù, and the remaining 20 hours were devoted to Erlyvideo. Slowly, the second began to dominate. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3i/xm/4o/3ixm4osrdyvekr70k95hws4alza.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Money has become even less, everything has become sad. Even when I closed the whole story with part-time jobs, there were some sales that allowed me to hire the first employee, all this was very difficult. I‚Äôll make a note here ...</font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did not have investments and there was very little accumulated money. It is important to understand that investment is a very expensive loan. If you are ready to take an investment, make a product and get out of it in three years - that's great. There is nothing to do here without investments, that is, it is impossible to do something without investment in three years so that it soars up. Well, you probably can, but it should be very lucky.</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/u5/7b/kiu57bbevhc9f6euqcc_hb0vh3e.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The problem with investment is that it is a huge, very expensive debt. Debt that cannot be simply repaid in cash. The growth rate of investments in a good business is much higher than even gang loans. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And, an important point, it would be nice if the investment is ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù. In short, the story is this:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>   ,   ,   ,    ,   -      ‚Äì ,  ,       ;</li>
<li>    ,     ,   ,        ‚Äì  , , , ,    ;  ,          ,  .</li>
</ul><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6l/mq/wt/6lmqwtwreawyhne9wcm4mpsfe-e.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, if you are not ready for such things, for such a conflict (and this will always be some kind of conflict situation), then in any case with your own ‚Äúpillow‚Äù, with your own money it‚Äôs calmer, and with investments it will be faster - I didn‚Äôt have it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And since it wasn‚Äôt, by the beginning of 2012 I was going to shut it all down. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I was absolutely discouraged, even tried to do something else that could feed me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But he did not close the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did I analyze this later?</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Slow recognition in b2b</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I went to the b2b market. I went to a place where businesses buy something from other businesses in order to be better and earn more. In this market, the price of error is high! If I buy a phone that I did not like, I will lose 20, 40 thousand rubles. And if a business buys something that turned out to be bad at the wrong time in the wrong place, the cost of an error can be millions and billions of rubles. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hw/fn/ea/hwfneaargzkxeekrxrpmlcdhpua.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Plus, I started making software, which, generally speaking, is the core for many businesses. Now imagine: you go to do some kind of business, start software / some kind of your own startup ... People come to you and say: ‚ÄúYou do not need to do anything! Just completely entrust the core of your business to us. We will give you the finished thing. " I was just the kind of person who comes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
People looked at me: ‚ÄúMmm ... We do not believe, no, we do not believe. Tell, speak, but not yet - we don't believe. ‚Äù This is normal. People look how old we are in the market. It is important. Because if you have been in the market for a year, then businesses will walk past you. Whatever you say, no matter who you vouch for, please live four years! Here live 4 years, and we will come to you. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The same story with conferences happens. Here you come to her for the first time - they pass by you, just look. The third time they say: ‚ÄúOh! Aren't you dead? So you can work with. ‚Äù People have such a simple thing, so I, without waiting, began to die. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With b2b you have to be prepared to wait. Or you will be lucky and some early adopters will be ready to give you money, but they will not be enough for anything. You have to be prepared for this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The alternative is not very pleasant: to be part of the "big". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If this happened and you were quickly bought at an early stage (for example, some Rostelecom), they can put you and shove anything in a big product ... People will be familiar to any level of quality - it's great! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What to expect from him? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this is already a little different, this is not at all your own business.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Partnership and divorce</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I had a story about partnerships. In 2013, I somehow hesitated, and I was offered a partnership by a person from the United States. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why do you need a partnership? Since I was a programmer, I clearly understood that without sales experience, but a man came who said: ‚ÄúI can make sales!‚Äù In fact, he could, in principle, make some good sales. Moreover, he had experience in building sales for large companies (he had two). Plus, he was an American, immersed in the subject in the American market. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He said: ‚ÄúI understand what you are doing. This is cool! I want to sell it. You and I will make a ton of money, retire with this thing. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/qf/ik/tfqfikngw4gmxgam5sspfqh8hpa.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So they made Flussonic LLC in Delaware. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I even flew to visit once. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We talked a lot - this is a feature of the Americans, they like to repeat, repeat, repeat ... You get lost in this stream of words. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, nothing helped ... </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fortunately, we calmly, without conflict, dispersed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think this is a mega luck. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I got really lucky that we parted without consequences in a year.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Home sales growth</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sales in Russia began to grow precisely because people began to trust. They look: now, for the third year now, eyes have been blistering - you can take something and buy it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The American office looked like a parasite: a lot of people ... I have two employees, four there, and we began to earn more money. We began to earn more money on the Russian market than it did on the American one, although it was generally unclear why and how ... Probably, they had the same story with Lag in b2b. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/im/aj/xm/imajxm9zfc7yoovh80hystyrlim.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most importantly, we were not able to overcome the language barrier. I can speak English, sit chatting with people, write in English. But the story is about that very conceptual barrier ... The word "product" for the programmer means that you can download something from the site, and for the director - an examination of another or your own business.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here we also had a language barrier, which I did not fully understand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I know that we had it, and we could not overcome it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, we had a job like cancer with a pike, which was caused by both lack of money and discommunication, so we need to be careful here. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r2/bi/vy/r2bivyemtkyf1qm3uw4xybljpne.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We quietly parted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He said: "I want to do one thing, you do another thing - we will no longer intersect." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today I would not do it all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Partnership is very accurate, because it is very difficult to disperse, this can lead to fatal consequences for the business.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Subscriptions Grow</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then we started to grow - it was great! These are the first pleasant sensations after several years of torment. The growth was due to subscriptions, we switched to a subscription model. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What is it? Instead of $ 2,000, I take $ 75. It seems like some kind of nightmare: 2000 - money that you can already spend, someone to hire, but here - 75 ... What is it? Go to the tavern. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Subscriptions led to the expected loss of revenue. The first few months, people instead of 1000-2000 dollars pay 75, and you just think: ‚ÄúGod! Why pay a salary? ‚Äù The main thing is to hold on. Hold on for several months.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is difficult because you need to be able to accept payments. To accept 2000 dollars at once is generally garbage! Currency control, under the agreement for rubles - no difference. When we talk about subscriptions, His Majesty Billing comes up. Billing is a pain because it is a terribly customizable thing. You think: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll draw the tariff plans now - such and such, fifth-tenths!‚Äù But we are in b2b: here all issues are resolved by agreements: </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- I am ready to buy from you on such conditions! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Well, here I have tier pricing (note: price level) ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - I don‚Äôt understand anything! If you want $ 1,000 a month, I'll pay you. Do not want to leave.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here, of course, you need to go towards the client, because you need to somehow work with this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, my recommendation here is this: do not spend too much time looking for ready-made billing, it is better to hire a person who will write this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maybe I'm wrong, but I think so.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did they grow, or why is $ 75 more than 2000?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Subscriptions are revenue growth. Why? </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ta/ok/0g/taok0gueembvxgq5n_eq51iwysw.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have a client who buys about 100 licenses from us. To pay us for 100 licenses, he would have to take 200 thousand and give them to us once. It is not simple! This cannot be solved by e-mail: you need to fly, communicate, negotiate, you need "people in ties" ... It's a lot of money. I know this, we had such agreements. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And when it is by subscription, it expands smoothly. Addressing the audience: </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- What, Nikita, are you ready to accept 200 thousand dollars on the card? Or pay? .. So, pay, of course.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It‚Äôs easier for a person to expand. This is all about scaling. The client takes one server, and then he has either growth, or he thinks: ‚ÄúCome on, I‚Äôll replace one more thing with‚Äú Fluxonic ‚Äù- it works well!‚Äù And it‚Äôs not very problematic for him to gradually increase monthly. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, we have customers who are 4 years old. They started from one server, and now they have 70-80 each. These are tangible things. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is important that when you sign up for a subscription, you have one conversation: you explain, invest in support, it helps him. Then you look - and he went in and ... clap - increased, clap - increased ... Sellers do not work at the same time! This approach really allows you to remove hemorrhoids with sellers.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order to raise 200 thousand dollars, you need very good sellers who will go and explain to the client what is needed. Truth? Well, when how ... At least for the software - that's for sure! This is not hosting. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For customers, this is also easier. They are slowly increasing the plus. Many companies still have an investment committee: paying up to $ 1,000 is one story, from 2 to 10 thousand dollars is another, and more than 100 thousand, you need to go to the general administration, who will say that these are big grandmas and will offer to go to big major. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is a small problem here: we were unable to build referral programs, and this, as we know, is important for any software vendor to learn how to sell through someone else.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The problem here is very simple: if we take 75 dollars a month, then even 10% of the referral commission is a lot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if a person brought us 10 licenses (he thinks he's so cool, cool), we pay him $ 75 a month. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He is not at all interested! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A person must bring a lot to make a tangible income. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don‚Äôt know how to be here - I have no simple answers.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What have you come to today?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We make software that can be downloaded, delivered, implemented in our business - installation and making money. We have a solution: we sat down and wrote some text for clients telling us that we need to take it, go there, do it, and we will do it, and in general, we will do everything and you will have money ... This is for people like, we have a very good introduction. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/1p/uf/kq1pufhby554izwqdaurebhgwz4.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We also have a ton of implementations. We do not have very many Internet companies in Russia (there are many abroad). In Russia, we have some kind of production. Who would have thought that ships needed our software? It turned out very much! We have installations in the courts.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In three Russian courts (supreme, arbitration and city) we are. We have election commissions, stories about video recording in factories. You can‚Äôt always guess that some plant may need audio and video fixation of how they make their cement batches. It turns out that they are needed, and they are very satisfied. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have over 500 subscription customers. These are those who monthly bring us money. Headache for finding money is relieved. Sales to almost 100 countries. That's cool! Thanks to globalization. It‚Äôs cool that it exists, and it‚Äôs cool that we can, while sitting in Russia, accept money from all over the world under Russian law. Not so easy! I can‚Äôt say that this is elementary.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Traditionally, the country of first class jurisdiction is the United States. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you want everything to be smooth everywhere - this is the United States, and if not from there, everything will not be smooth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Europe is the second class, anyway. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is PayPal there, Stripe is also nowhere there, and American cards do not always go to Europe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Amex is generally a purely American story. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Nevertheless, sitting in Russia, not having a foreign company (we do not need this), we are very cheap. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A foreign company is expensive no matter who says it.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Piracy</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We got piracy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our software began to pirate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's very funny. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We learned how to deal with it, even managed to somehow beat. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fighting hard - it sucks out strength, nerves, so you just need to work with it.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Current issues</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What are the problems now? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What have I come with and how do I understand this? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The stage of survival has been completed at the level of several years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A couple of tens of thousands of dollars a month - you understand that you can already hire people, grow (there is growth) and everything is fine ...</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About hiring</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But hiring people is hard! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have a lot of cool, chic programmers in our country! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We still have it all: a lot of people with brains, it's cool to hire them (how many people Oleg [Bunin] collects each time), but, for example, finding PR-boxers / marketers for b2b is very difficult. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, we now somehow found guys who, in principle, know how to approach some site of an American magazine. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f3/fe/aj/f3feajc1paxglyl3rnd6vnnh7ee.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most people who are connected with all this, they say (aspirated): ‚ÄúAhh, the international market - it's so scary! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We cannot go there, we are not ready. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We must grow to the size of Yandex, and then we can think about how to enter the international market. " </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This thought should be crushed in the bud!</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On entering the international market</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Important: making a digital product (something that does not require physical delivery, presence somewhere), you will immediately open the entire market, if you are not too lazy to make an English version of the site. Or, if you do not do such a thing as the release of the Russian version in the program, the whole world opens up for you, and Russia makes up 3% of it. You immediately 30 times increases where you can sell this software / service / product. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this case, even if you are not very cool, even if your demand abroad is 5 times lower than in Russia, it is still a multiple increase in money. At present, only 20% of money is earned in Russia (this is the figure at the beginning of 2017). Maybe even less ... Everything else is foreign sales from around the world.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next sick story, which I vaguely understand how to do, is international advertising. In b2b, the marketing story is different: it‚Äôs hard to pour traffic to the landing page, measure conversions from it ... What is the conversion rate from it, if our main competitor (the largest company that does this) has 20 thousand visitors a day on the site? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Stories with online marketing in b2c products speak of hundreds of thousands, millions of visitors per day. And here 20 thousand are the largest. Here you grab every lead. For you, this is not something that you can experiment with and throw away, because it can be an employee, for example, IBM. How can you take it to rotate and throw it away for an experiment? This bad experiment will be very expensive, so it‚Äôs hard here.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is international PR companies that are very painful and difficult, because with the language, not everything is as good as it should be. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus, Russia's reputation in the international market is not the first assistant.</font></font><br>

Therefore, people are not afraid that we will resolve. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About us, while we were working, about 3 video streaming services that were made in Russia were closed with me (before my eyes), and we are alive, we live normally.</font></font></li>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Such a niche business is very difficult to sell. This is important to understand. When you have a project that doesn‚Äôt even make money - this is the site on which you managed to drive 10 million unique people a month - this is a completely sold story. She is appreciated! When you have a niche business, yours is a little different - not what we hear about every day. Therefore, in order to sell a company, you need to understand how it will continue to happen, so that at least you do not throw people. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Maxim, tell me, did you have a reassessment of your activity, which you considered very important in the early stages, but it turned out after the fact that it actually turned out to be unimportant? What were these actions, steps? </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- A very good question! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The overestimation of the fact that you have a limited amount of time that you can spend was very great. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You, for example, spend on one thing, but in fact you need to spend on another. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, you can go with such a niche software to one conference, but instead you can go to another. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, if I had identified clients more correctly (5 years ago), it would have been earlier, better, and faster.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It would be possible to get to customers faster - to understand that in Russia we will have operators ... That it makes no sense to go to Russia on Internet projects - so far I have not worked very well with them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you can go to the operators: cool, good guys, do not try to do development - they need a turnkey solution that you just need to buy and operate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What matters is how to spend time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, this is the identification of the market and customers.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About business and growth in IT</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Tell me, please, how did you come to realize that you need to do something of your own (precisely from the point of view of the individual)? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not ‚ÄúI was doing something and it was not clear to me where it was going‚Äù, but ‚ÄúI am not doing anything for myself, but now they are starting to do something‚Äù ... What happened in my head, how did it click? </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Stubbornness, a sense of self-assurance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once again stubbornness, plus hard work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If this is not all, then my path will not work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It makes sense to understand: you are doing something, and many people in the world use it, that is, many who care, many who need it, many who use it ...</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It can be difficult. When I started doing this, I probably did not see 90% of how they would use my software later. I have not seen the whole story at all. I'm lucky! But even what I saw was enough to understand that my skills (what I had already learned to do), if I put it in a different way, you can sell, it will be cool, they will be used everywhere.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another important thing, unfortunately ... I always say the word "sell": it would be cool if everything was open source and somehow brought money, but there is a small problem - many businesses will not take open source at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They just need a purchase, so that it is someone behind all this, and open source, not open source - this is a secondary issue of price (for scaling a license, for example). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having come into a big business, you cannot say: ‚ÄúLook, here is open source, download.‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They will tell you: "No, no, go, get out of here." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A good example is the PostgreSQL guys. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They also have open source, but they eventually sell some product - for adaptation, for work, for support. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have a commercial product - it's easier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a way, it‚Äôs easier, in a way it will be harder.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the movement to the West. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Distribution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lawyers</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - As I understand it, you want to move more to the Western market. You did not think to do this through distributors who are already there, provide some services already through the end markets (via telecoms and so on)? </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Good question. It is difficult to sell to the whole world. It is very difficult, but here we can strongly focus on our competitors (a large American company) who have both such and such. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What is the problem with distributors? They do not want to integrate into the way I see it for myself: they will not sell by subscription, they will not engage in technical support. They are ready to just take something on the spot, pack it, then - put it to the client, and even with one-time payments.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One-time payments is a different story, a different business model. It is more traditional, and it is more alien to me, far from me. It is difficult to engage in the sale of subscription (closer to the service model) through distributors. They are not ready to fit into this. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - I guess I can convince you a little. There is a stand of 1C ... </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - You spoke of a conflict of interest when a person, working ‚Äúfor an uncle‚Äù, develops his project. It is clear that in America, the conflict of interest is very acute. How acute is this problem in Russia? </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Sergey Vasin, Banki.ru. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, I missed the beginning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I understand it, you are the founder. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before that, were there any businesses? </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Never, nothing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only work "for uncle."</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Russia today is a country for business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About taxes and Skolkovo</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Were there any entrepreneurial fears at the beginning when you work at work and already have some kind of idea, some idea? Were there such fears that you lacked skills? .. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Throw away the fears! Fear fetters and makes you dumber. Do not be afraid. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is clear that it‚Äôs easier to rush into the pool with your head when you are 23, 25, there is no child, and the wife says: ‚ÄúAy, do what you want!‚Äù If anything happens, then the programmer gets a decent job without any problems during the day. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - If anything, I will find another husband ... </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Then you need to quickly look for another wife, if such a conversation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, fears, some fears that there will be problems somewhere ... How to pay taxes, whether to pay them, not to pay, and what will happen if you do not pay taxes ... It hurts! We are now paying 27%, and we are completely white. Someone cannot, for example, go out ... If you are small, if you have 3 people, you will pay 43%, so for a small company this is a serious blow to everything. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
(Responding to a cry from the audience) We did not become agents of Skolkovo. There is personal income tax, social tax, people still have to pay. You forgot? </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/ma/wn/ngmawn4jcxgdmboqj7pikzc3ssg.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Well, Skolkovo has the same support. Grants are not important, but it is important that there is a single social tax of 14%. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, grants to take ... No, no, no! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We know these grants! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some still hiccups. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I can‚Äôt answer this question simply because I didn‚Äôt do it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Skolkovo? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It‚Äôs possible, probably, but it‚Äôs still not clear whether it is necessary or not ... </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fears - to hell! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Awareness is needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The state makes excellent conditions for creating a business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Very easy, very cool! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Paying taxes with us is really easy, compared to the States. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I know this from my own experience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To pay taxes in the States - you need to work closely with this, and it‚Äôs good if you have someone who has already paid and dealt with everything, passed their checks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have only one tax [service], there are three tax. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, there‚Äôs nothing to worry about!</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once again about fears</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - I want to clarify. I have such a fear that there are not enough resources. One, two, three people will not do what is intended. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Focus! Work 30 hours a day. Beat the investment. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Maybe make a smaller product? </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Yes, cut back. So he is not needed. You see, a huge number of things can be done by taking only three people: focus only on this, and you will most likely do such a thing that it will do a good amount of people - such a [quantity] that you have enough to live on. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not ready like that? You can take investments and do things differently: immediately take an office with cookies, with all other things. But no need to be afraid!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You just need to sit down, count, try. Plus, I highly recommend looking - there are a huge number of stories, tips on how to check if someone needs this. The worst thing is to do what no one needs. You think that this is necessary, but in fact someone alone said: ‚ÄúIt would be cool if it were like this!‚Äù How much will you pay? Yes, not at all! So a bad idea. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
See what makes people angry, what annoys them. Since it infuriates, then you can earn money here. What infuriates people is what they are willing to pay for, so that it does not infuriate them. Therefore - Customer development, and go! Or refuse on time, return to work and say: "I'll try again." </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AT:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You said that it‚Äôs scary to do what no one needs. And at the beginning of your report, you said that you did not research the market at all, you did not do it at all. You just did something, it was interesting to you. That is, you are in the dark, ‚Äúblind,‚Äù in the black room somehow oriented. And if it hadn‚Äôt fired? </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - I would go back to work and would not stand here now. Everything is very simple! There are plenty of such examples. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We are now making some new stories within the company, we are launching more products within the company. We now have a service for collecting statistics. Why did we start to launch it? People ask, they say: ‚ÄúWe want!‚Äù We have already accumulated a sufficient number of customers who say: ‚ÄúWe are ready to use it, we need it!‚Äù Great, we will do it.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is already there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you have no customers, find somewhere else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Find, look, to whom it can be sold. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just call, find the phone on LinkedIn, pick up the phone and say, ‚ÄúHello! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I already have such a cool thing! ‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The man will answer: ‚ÄúYes, come on! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cool! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Come! ‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs come to you in a year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well thank you". </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, then I did stupid things, blindly did everything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I understand that it was wrong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We had to first communicate with people.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where to go?</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - My second question is about the development of your company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now are you ready to do another business, relying on this basic one? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, perhaps, the current flows into something? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, how big is your company in terms of the number of employees? </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gj/ne/ju/gjnejuwfajq_yh_ruxvaenha04w.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ML:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - We have a little - there are 15 of us now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have an unplowed field. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We still have to do-do-do and sell, develop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I estimate that we will grow 10-20 times for sure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is without infusions of money from the outside. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why throw something? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thank you very much for your attention! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And good luck to all of you if you come together in a similar way!</font></font><br>
