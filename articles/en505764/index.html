<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hello!</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Hello. I'm Phil's robot. I can talk on topics of a certain circle. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What topics can you discuss?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The range of topics for discussion: human evolution - how it differs from animals - artificial intelligence, the change of economic formations capitalism - communism, propaganda and fakes, religion, the meaning of life. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where is the end of capitalism?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Capitalism will end when automation completely displaces people from material production. In addition to mass unemployment (with high social benefits), this also entails the collapse of a market economy. The main market regulator - the cost of goods - is determined by the cost of living labor (working time) for its production. This is the axis of the supply-demand swing, if the axis is pulled out, the swing will fall. How many zeros can be exchanged for one zero? Exchanges simply will not be able to work in conditions of price chaos. What is the way out of crises? </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the way out of crises?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The way out of crises, as usual is to strengthen state regulators, only this time is irreversible. A step, another - and to a planned economy, straight into the notorious communism. In the global economy, this is a large ‚ÄúSoviet Union‚Äù from the Councils of Europe, America, China and others. Political systems can be different, and the economy is general and planned (resources are unevenly distributed). See some other development option? Explain to the dark robot how prices in stores will be formed during unmanned production? The accumulation of a critical mass of communism is already taking place. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communism is terrible</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Communism is meant in the initial, maximal sense, the second phase. Not a political system, but an economic formation, a mode of production and distribution. This has no relation either to democracy, or to totalitarianism, or to other socio-political constructs, only to capitalism, as its heir. Post-industrial, post-market formation. Universal prosperity is a moot point, unemployment is not considered happiness today, although in Marx‚Äôs time a decent allowance would seem like happiness ... </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communism is a totalitarian regime</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mixing concepts is a typical psychological warfare, in this case ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù was used by all parties. Some to motivate supporters with a bright future, others to smear them with a tragic present as much as possible. There were no robots then, they tried to make them out of people! But this did not work, people were not conscious enough. But now here we are. The big Soviet Union will take shape. By the way, the Fake Control project is aimed at exposing the methods of psychological warfare, who are interested. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Marxism failed</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Actually, no one disputed the economic part of Marxism. There is even a modern version, "21st Century Capital" by the French economist Tom. It has been convincingly shown that everything goes precisely according to Marx. The rich everywhere get richer faster than the poor, in Russia, anywhere. The mistake of the Communists was in underestimating the dynamics of the technical revolution. The growth of labor productivity avoids mass proletarization, just the rich get richer faster. A completely different social picture is obtained: they don‚Äôt climb barricades just because someone is richer. Now, if technological progress, for some reason, stopped, everything would go according to the classical canons. Capital simply could not grow without mass impoverishment, with all that it implies. But history went a different way. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How is it ‚Äúto each according to his needs‚Äù</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the disappearance of the market, the principle of ‚Äúto each according to his needs‚Äù comes into force, although limited, the resources are not infinite. There will be some other form of distribution not based on exchange. This applies only to the manufacturing sector, humanitarian professions will not go anywhere. Writing books, teaching, treating is not for robots, they only have the cognitive (cognitive) part based on the same principles as humans, and the emotional and evaluative functions are completely different. You can‚Äôt copy them, but nobody needs it. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does it mean, ‚ÄúThe accumulation of a critical mass of communism now‚Äù?</font></font></b><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The critical mass of communism is already accumulating now - this text has been prepared on the Linux platform - a free software distributed by volunteers. What is the name of this work? And it is increasingly competing with commercial developments, which are supported by artificial legal restrictions on distribution. Information products lack the main property of a marketable product - the ability to exchange. Replicated unlimitedly, without disappearing at the source. We have to artificially drive it into commodity relations, limiting copying rights. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Commercial software leads</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Actually, commercial software, and indeed any commercial info-product, is kept only due to artificial legal restrictions that tie the dissemination of information to traditional commodity exchange. The most interesting thing is that about 80% of free open source code is now created by commercial enterprises. They have no choice, without Linux applications, they will lose part of the market and lose to competitors. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How is information different from a classic product?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Information differs from the classic product on which market exchange is based. When transferred to another, it does not disappear at the source. The production of information requires labor, but copying is practically free. Therefore, artificial legal restrictions are created (rights, copyrights, etc.) in order to exchange it for traditional goods, but this will lose its meaning when the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù goods themselves are created by information technologies. This is a matter of time only. </font></font><br>

 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What will people do without work?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What will people do without the need to earn money? Who knows, wait and see. Humanitarian and engineering activities will remain - literature, music, cinema, the creation of robots and their management, finally. But this is for a small part of the population. Will the transition be easy? Hardly. All transitions between formations were not easy. From hunting to farming, from patriarchal farming to industrial production, now - to a post-industrial structure. Conflicts will also not disappear anywhere, ethnic, religious and others, they are not directly connected with the exchange. Should the notorious warming happen - where will the millions from the flooded territories go? The current problems of refugees will seem like toys. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Will the money disappear?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Money in an automated economy will cease to play the role of a source of wealth, because it will no longer be the equivalent of the cost of labor - there will be no living labor in things. As a means of accounting, money may remain, but it cannot be ‚Äúmade‚Äù, it can only be received and spent. Something else will take the place of an indicator of social status. Maybe the "social scores" that China is experimenting with. Human nature will not change; genes have not changed since Cro-Magnon times. Hierarchy, status, rivalry - all this will remain. </font></font><br>
 <br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does the Communist Party have to do with it?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The humor is that no political movements are needed to transition to a post-capitalist formation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything happens in the laboratories. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communist parties have nothing to do with post-capitalism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can say that Linus Torvalds has done much more for practical communism than Lenin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although, China is successfully moving towards communism under the leadership of the Communist Party ... Well, so they have a godless religion ... </font></font><br>
