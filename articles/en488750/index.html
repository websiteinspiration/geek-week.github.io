<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead of a foreword</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quite a lot of articles were written about the first computers. Someone looked at them casually for granted. Someone went into details, described their internal structure, analyzed the historical prerequisites for their creation and their role in world technological progress. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, all these aspects of the history of computers are extremely important and useful. They help us understand why the world in which we live today works the way it works. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, this does not negate some of the boring and didactic nature of such materials. They leave the reader face to face with figures and facts and do not give a three-dimensional view of the computer.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As part of a small experiment, we would like to tell you about the two ‚Äúfirst‚Äù computers: Aiken's machine, which he created in the 1940s together with IBM, and the Whirlwind project, which is not often mentioned in such articles, despite its notable fate. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First of all, we would like to show these computers ‚Äúface‚Äù: to find interesting archival documents, bring photographs and video recordings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The detailed story of Mark I and Whirlwind has already been repeatedly told to us.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first "computer" by Howard Aiken</font></font></h2><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Meet this man's name is Howard Aiken. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is generally believed that it is to him that we owe the appearance of the world's first device, which, with some stretch, can be called a programmable computer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The project he proposed was supposed to replace a person in solving differential equations that have only numerical solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Aiken came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a device in the mid to late 1930s while working on his doctoral dissertation at Harvard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a series of very successful attempts to assemble simple calculators suitable for solving a narrow range of problems, he thought about something more complete and interesting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By his own admission, the future car was inspired by the work of Charles Babbage.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'm afraid if Babbage lived 75 years later, I would have been out of work </font></font><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Howard Aiken</font></font></b></blockquote> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/0q/ag/sz0qagdazb8axr7kqsbawneorje.png"><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Having made a detailed description of the concept of a future computer and secured financial support from the U.S. Navy (Aiken was a second-rank captain), he set about pacing the thresholds of companies that would help him put the project into practice: provide technical expertise and provide an adequate element base. But not everything was smooth. Nobody wanted to believe in Aiken‚Äôs car. Someone refused because of the excessive complexity of the project, someone because of the lack of market prospects. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Below is an excerpt from an oral interview with Robert Campbell, one of Aiken‚Äôs colleagues at IBM, as well as an abridged translation.</font></font><br>
<blockquote>CAMPBELL: 1937 (,      ASCC. ‚Äî . ). It described functionally a machine which had a rather complete repertoire of characteristics, but said almost nothing about how it might be constructed or what components would be used. What circuitry techniques or what other mechanical techniques as far as that's concerned. It did, however, talk about tape programming I think. <br>
<br>
/ 1937        ,       ,        .       .  ,   ,       ./<br>
<br>
ASPRAY: What did that mean? /   ?/ <br>
<br>
CAMPBELL: Well, a sequence control device from instructions somehow encoded in the punch paper (in a tape, not necessarily punched paper). But other than that there was very little dealing with specific components or specific design techniques. So having developed this concept Aiken tried to find a way of implementing it. He didn't have the resources himself. He was an instructor at Harvard at that point finishing up his doctorate degree. He first went to a number of business machine companies. It was at Monroe that he talked to George Chase, chief engineer. Chase was quite interested in the concept and would like to have tried implementing it using necessarily mechanical techniques, but the top management at Monroe was not interested. <br>
<br>
/    , -    . ,  ,           .   ,      .      .     ,  .       ,  .             ,    ,  -     ./<br>
<br>
ASPRAY: They just didn't see a market for it, or what? /       ,  ?/<br>
<br>
CAMPBELL: Either they didn't want to spend the money for it or they didn't see a market for it either. He went to other business machine companies. I don't know how many. But he was unable to get any interest. Then through Professor Theodore Brown at the Business School and Harlow Shapley in the Astronomy Department he secured a introduction to Bryce ‚Äî James Bryce of IBM, who was a senior executive in New York with a long history of engineering inventions. He became interested in Aiken's ideas; and through Bryce it was arranged for Aiken to talk to Watson. &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; In any case, Watson became quite interested in Aiken's idea. <br>
<br>
/       ,    .      .   ,   [  ].      .       Business School             IBM,    -.    ;         . &lt;‚Ä¶&gt;   ,     ./</blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The further development of events is already more or less known to most readers: Watson, president of IBM, turned out to be a visionary man with a rich imagination and warmly supported Aiken's idea. We can say that Aiken pulled out a lucky ticket, starting a partnership with IBM: in those years, few companies had access to such a rich selection of technical components. In Aiken‚Äôs own words, if IBM had refused him, he would have to go to RCA or Bell Laboratories, and his machine could become completely electronic, rather than electronic-mechanical. Or not to be born at all. Summing up, it is worth noting once again: Aiken came to Watson with a project containing only a description of the requirements for the functionality of the machine. All technical implementation belongs to IBM and to some extent Aiken himself and his colleagues.At IBM, the project was named ASCC - Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Thomas Watson was extremely proud that the first such machine would be released in his company, but at the end of the project his joy was overshadowed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the ceremonial handover of the finished test machine to Harvard, Aiken did not mention IBM's contribution to its creation in his speech. Thomas Watson became furious and broke off further cooperation with Aiken. The name ‚ÄúASCC‚Äù was replaced by the paramilitary Mark I, and Aiken and IBM parted ways.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's make one more remark about Aiken‚Äôs personality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the same Campbell, Aiken belonged to the category of mathematical engineers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His real interest in computers lay purely on a practical plane. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Computations were in the first place, and cars remained only a convenient auxiliary tool. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He did not create a computer for the computer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, when in 1944 the monster for $ 200,000 (according to other sources, for $ 500,000) was finally completed and delivered to Harvard, Aiken with enthusiasm, no less than in development, started using it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here is a brief description of the resulting machine.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over 765 thousand components.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About 17 meters in length.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2.5 meters in height.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weight: 4.5 tons.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Synchronization of modules using a 15-meter shaft with an electric motor.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the insistence of Thomas Watson, the machine was enclosed in a ‚Äúcloset‚Äù of glass and stainless steel.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The machine could replace up to 20 people with manual devices for performing calculations.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The machine was programmable and did not require human intervention during operation.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Despite all of the above, the car was extremely slow even for its time.</font></font></li>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
It is customary to say that Mark I was not really used in any serious calculations for 15 years of its work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let us dwell on this moment in more detail.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Howard Aiken was appointed head of the Harvard Computing Laboratory, which, in turn, was at the disposal of the US Shipping Bureau. Of course, any technical advantage during the Second World War could be decisive, and the bureau of shipping was extremely positive about the appearance of a computer. Nevertheless, due to the specifics of the bureau, there were few orders for settlements with Mark I. Much more calculations were done for the ammunition bureau research laboratory. Work on the machine took place in three shifts, and in the ‚Äúfree‚Äù time it was used to calculate Bessel tables, in which Aiken saw its main purpose. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next computer project, Mark II, was developed at the end of 1944 by Aiken and Campbell. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was planned to create another electromechanical calculator, this time for the needs of the Dalgren naval training ground. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He was followed by two more similar cars, Mark III and Mark IV, respectively. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Aiken's last computer no longer contained mechanical components and used memory on magnetic cores. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To date, Mark I is still operational. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2014, it was serviced and launched.</font></font><br>

The official shutdown of the ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù took place in 1959 in connection with its complete obsolescence.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whirlwind I Project: First Display Computer</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Perhaps the Whirlwind project is one of the most interesting computers ever created. His brief history is as follows: in the early 1940s, the US Navy needed a simulator for pilots that would not be tied to a specific model of the aircraft and could be reprogrammed at any time immediately before the training session. The development was entrusted to a team of engineers led by Jay Forrester of MIT. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pt/yl/jp/ptyljp096aq8qifoj9zy-f2fpii.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The catch was that the Navy needed not just a computer, but a system that responded to operator actions in real time. In the first year of development, Forrester focused his team on creating an analog machine capable of calculating the trajectory of the aircraft, but this solution was too complicated and not flexible enough for such a task.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1945, Forrester's group began to study the basics of digital technology and design a new computer using new technologies. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The technical complexity of the project (up to 100,000 operations per second was required against the usual 1000-10,000 at that time), the creators did not have such experience (the first fully electronic ENIAC computer just started working, a favorite of the girls, respectively, a new machine had to be developed with zero) and a host of other factors stretched the project over time. At the very early stages, the group leaders decided on the need to split the development of the project into two phases. At the first stage, it was planned to build a simplified machine, Whirlwind I, so that, taking into account its mistakes and the accumulation of experience, then create a more advanced, powerful and expensive computer.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p6/ya/ln/p6yaln8dccs6qwkx8l6ztgu4jea.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first detailed computer project was ready by 1947, after the war, and the end of testing all critical nodes was planned for 1949. However, history has made adjustments to this plan.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The high cost in the development of Mark I was partially offset by its military use. But at the end of World War II, the US government drastically reduced all military budgets, and the unfinished computer lost its main goal: the Air Force didn‚Äôt need to train pilots so intensively, there were enough ‚Äúconservative‚Äù methods, which, moreover, were worth it significantly cheaper. According to average estimates, the development of Whirlwind, in view of attracting a significant number of both human and technical resources, cost the United States about $ 1.8 million per year (which in terms of modern money gives as much as about $ 18 million). </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whirlwind Floor Plan</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Oddly enough, oddly enough, the EDVAC computer being developed in parallel was another stone towards the economic inexpediency of the Whirlwind project, the costs of which turned out to be significantly lower. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is quite natural that the flight simulator project was minimized and reorganized into a purely ‚Äúcomputing‚Äù one. The patronage of Whirlwind in 1948 passed from the Navy to the US Navy, which generally supported the development, but advocated for a significant reduction in price and simplification of the computer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Forrester and Everett, development team leaders, turned to find a new customer for their project. They were made by the US Air Force, which, as part of the construction of an air defense system, needed a machine capable of combining data from multiple radars into a single map. By 1949-50, most of the finance came into the project from this department.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Whirlwind I was commissioned in the early spring of 1951. As expected, the bulk of the machine time was given to the needs of the US Air Force.

Whirlwind I was also the first computer to receive a graphic display and a light gun as a control:</font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An amateur video made at the Smithsonian Institution Museum, where one of Whirlwind fragments is exhibited.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Immediately upon completion of construction, the computer was put into operation. With it, the US Air Force tested a new air defense system, the Cape Cod System. The project was curated by a specially created Lincoln Laboratory. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The tasks of the computer included solving problems of tracking targets for fighters. A special graphic display, which we wrote about a little higher, was created specifically for the convenience of operators: the system allowed you to "point" the light gun to the desired target. Another display, optional, was used to create copies of the screen - the camera was pointed at it. By 1953, the ‚ÄúCape Cod System‚Äù coped with tracking 48 targets using 14 radars.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to purely militaristic tasks, the computer was also used by scientists for calculations. The main requests came to the laboratory from ONR and MIT. According to some reports, a computer solved up to 200 such tasks per year. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The development of the Whirlwind project did not end on the creation of the first model. The second version of the computer, Whirlwind II, by 1959 surpassed its predecessor many times and the further use of Whirlwind I was considered economically inexpedient. The first shutdown of the computer took place in June 1959. However, the computer did not stand idle for a long time and was soon leased to Wolf Research and Development Company, founded by a former member of the Whirlwind project. For about 5 years, the computer worked in the office of the company, solving its tasks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A complete shutdown of the computer took place in 1964. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whirlwind I was disassembled, and one of its fragments was transferred to the Museum of Computer History (video above). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
