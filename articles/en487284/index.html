      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/company/vdsina/blog/487284/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I recently fell victim to a (fortunately unsuccessful) phishing attack. A few weeks ago I wandered around Craigslist and Zillow: I wanted to rent a home in the San Francisco Bay area. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I was attracted by the nice photos of one place, and I wanted to contact the landlords and learn more about it. Despite my experience as a security specialist, I did not understand that scammers were talking to me, right up to the third letter! Below I will tell you in detail I will analyze the case along with screenshots and disturbing calls.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am writing this to illustrate that well-trained phishing attacks can look very convincing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Security guards often recommend paying attention to grammar and typography in order to protect themselves from phishing: supposedly scammers have poor knowledge of the language and careless attitude to visual design. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In some cases, it really works, but it didn’t help in my case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most sophisticated scammers write in a good language and create the illusion of compliance with all written and unwritten rules, trying to justify the victim's expectations associated with this.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First letters: there’s nothing to worry about in general</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An announcement on craiglist said all interested parties would call. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the phone number itself was not there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I thought that this was due to an oversight, since many ads do the same. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I decided to write to the landlord and ask him for a number, as well as tell mine. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In response, he wrote that I can contact him by email: davidgrinde@engineers-hibernia-chevron.ca. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You might think that this should have seemed strange to me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the search for housing on such resources is often associated with some kind of troubles with phone numbers, mailboxes and strange workarounds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, I just wrote a letter to this email and received this answer:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/y4/pe/gey4pequ_2pqaatmf5s0w5jkuuw.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The landlord asks quite typical questions: “When are you planning to call in?”, “How many people will live with you?”, “What is your annual income?”</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then I did not realize that I was communicating with scammers</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The landlord said that he often was far away from home for a long time, and now he would be away for two whole years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seemed to me a little strange, but everyone has their own circumstances, you never know. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, many landlords with whom I spoke said the same thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the questions asked to me in the letter seemed quite appropriate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So I continued the conversation and answered them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I received this letter: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jl/nr/c9/jlnrc9p_hbk13hxk-2pbbm_dh6y.png"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“I do not have mobile communications here, I have access only to my working computer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will continue to communicate by email if this is ok for you. "</font></font><br>
«   3 .         .    …       (  1  ,    ).      Airbnb,   ...». </i><br>
<br>
<h2>    .   ,    80-90   ,   </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first alarm bell: “I do not have mobile communications here, I have access only to my working computer. We will continue to communicate by email if this is ok for you. ” The second is the strange appearance of Airbnb in our conversation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why did they want me to pay through Airbnb? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The third call is too many photos confirming that this is a real person. But if the person is not fake, then why try so hard to convince me of this? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, Airbnb really baffled me. Then I began to strongly suspect that I was communicating with scammers, but nevertheless, I was not sure. I realized that their fraud would not work if I made a reservation through Airbnb. Airbnb has a well-established dispute resolution process and I can quickly prove my case and return the money.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I showed the ad to a friend and he stated that this was not a scam. We should bet, because in the end I was right. But then I decided to check whether it was a fraud or not, and so I still asked for a link to Airbnb. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/rx/qg/wkrxqgbpapzomdmenthyqihzlpa.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They asked to wait. Wait for what? And for some reason they advised me to independently find their ad on Airbnb. It was also rather strange, and I did not see any sense in it. If they tried to fool me, then asking me to book their accommodation on Airbnb was pointless. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But stop ... I could not find it on Airbnb. And then I asked for the link again ...</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ku/rc/x7/kurcx7rg4txbe8dzcym4wgolj8q.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They sent her. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She looked real and had the domain airbnb.com. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But since this was not my first hunt for phishing scammers, I checked the real address of the link in the text version of the letter (URL Destination). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As they say, find two differences:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/e0/zt/wne0ztiuxfftzkee7oiy1xbiijk.png"><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Q.E.D!</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And there is. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a phishing link. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's get a look. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c8/pq/g6/c8pqg6g528_ilgevlczyighxecy.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This screenshot was taken a few days after my first investigation, then Chrome did not manage to mark this URL as dangerous. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The phishing site is just perfect! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is interactive and looks convincing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, I can easily assume that scammers can easily fall for those who do not doubt the origin of the URL. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/8f/is/oe8fis3jjcl1uxa6okig319nxpa.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Excellent fake reviews: 5/5. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Keep phishing, you're doing great! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I did not check the Request to Book button, but I’m sure that it would lead me to a phishing page where my card details would be successfully stolen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks, maybe another time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why am I so impressed?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The scam team - and I'm sure it was a team - did a great job with a high level of detail. They have perfect English, their letters look professional, their phishing site looks like Airbnb. From the address engineers-hibernia-chevron.ca, a redirect to hibernia.ca is configured. This will inspire confidence in those who want to check their domain. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am even more impressed with their subtle psychological tricks. At each stage of interaction with me, they left one unclear moment, which I had to clarify with them in order to move further towards my goal. It is much easier to feel something is wrong if you are asked questions. And if you ask questions, it becomes much harder to keep asking them about things that seem strange to you. Because you already asked enough and as if taking time from busy people.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At first, their ad did not have a phone number, and I was forced to ask for it. Then they directed me to the Airbnb website and I asked for a link. But for the first time they did not give it, so I was again forced to ask. All this was planned in advance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the conversation, they also mentioned that other people were also interested in their housing, supporting a plausible feeling of a limited time when I had to make a decision. Lastly, using Airbnb as a phishing site was sensible as it seemed like a trusted intermediary. At first I was really confused because I could not understand how they plan to steal my data. If they simply requested information about a bank or a credit card at the initial stage of communication, it would be easy to detect and reveal their scam.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to protect yourself from this? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some tips</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When chatting with strangers online, always check the origin of their links! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Usually, simply clicking on the link is not harmful, but in some cases this is enough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wasn’t 100% sure that this was a phishing scam until I brought up the fake Airbnb URL. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Please be aware that sender email addresses may be tampered with and domain names may not match their display. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just because you received an email from researchations@fbi.gov does not mean that the FBI sent you an email. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Look for signs that someone is leading you by the nose. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are they trying to convince you that real people are talking to you? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are they trying to make you act faster?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Use several ways to verify your identity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first alarm bell was that the fraudster supposedly can only communicate via email. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If someone offers to communicate remotely, arrange a video call, look for and compare his accounts of linkedin, facebook and so on. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I hope you enjoyed the preparation.</font></font><br>
