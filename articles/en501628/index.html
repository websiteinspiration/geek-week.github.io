<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tell me, please, where are you from?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I'm from Russia. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He lived in different cities, and was engaged in games in Moscow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We had a studio with a distributed team: someone in Moscow worked, someone in Kostroma, someone in Kherson. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He moved to Minsk even before he got to Wargaming, worked remotely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Married here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, he settled in Belarus. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2015, I started working at Wargaming as a game designer for the World of Tanks Blitz team.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did your career in game development begin?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I started at the Point of Reference company (then still a division of Astrum Online, later - Mail.Ru Games), where from 2007 to 2009 I worked on the game TimeZero. I came there to the position of a game designer ... Well, in general, I was just looking for work then, but it turned out that I was a good fit for the role of a game designer. Plus, I played quite a lot in TimeZero, was a member of the top clan, wrote some quests for the game. In general, I was hired 6 times more than I received before in a government agency. So I got into the igrostroy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And by education I‚Äôm a mathematician, I graduated from a mechmath, studied at Moscow State University, and graduated in Nizhny Novgorod. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, in certain areas of game design without knowledge of mathematics in any way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's say a narrative game designer will do without mathematics, but those who are engaged in some kind of systemic things are definitely not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here, half of the work is to count something, sort through, analyze, and so on.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did you get into Wargaming?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Came in 2015, performed a test. Liked. Have taken. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Initially, it was assumed that I would deal exclusively with clans, which I did not like at all. It seemed like a terrible curtailment of my expertise. I came from browser and social games, where there was one game designer and I needed to know all aspects of the game, do everything at once. As a result, in addition to the clans, I ‚Äúsqueezed out‚Äù other areas little by little and did something in them too - as it turned out later, I had a hand in almost all elements of the game.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2017, the World of Tanks Blitz analytics lead position was released, and I took it. Since I am a mathematician, I know games and have already analyzed something out of interest myself, I thought that such a role is up to me. We had a small department, but at the same time productive. In my report on DevGamm, I‚Äôll just tell how analysts along with other teams helped the game overcome the traditional ‚Äúthree-year crisis‚Äù (more about it at the end of the interview - ed.).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2018, I headed a new department, which brought together analysts, game designers, balancers, UX copywriters, and UX specialists themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Until recently, he held this position. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then we decided to separate analysts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The studio evolved, and it was necessary to accordingly change the structure and processes of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus, when you yourself evaluate your work - it gives a little schizophrenia. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our case, when the game designers who created some things worked closely with the analysts who evaluated these things, it was so.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">World of Tanks Blitz is a unique project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to what?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, World of Tanks, the ‚ÄúBig Tanks,‚Äù are unique in their own right. </font></font><br>
<blockquote><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The hardest part in games is to catch, find core gameplay</font></font></h3></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you find it is a victory. And the "big tanks" did it. Of course, we are their heirs. At the same time, we have a different gameplay, more dynamic. We specifically made a bet on him and on the greater contribution of each player to the victory, moved away from the strategy towards the shooter. Everything around the gameplay is also cool. Yes, a lot of things would be nice to change (in the backlog we have 2000 good ideas). But with the gameplay, everything is fine, this is our main USP. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Plus World of Tanks Blitz is a difficult game, but at the same time we are on mobile phones. And when we went out, there weren‚Äôt such mobile games at all, which you entered - and got a high-quality, well-coordinated PvP. Now there is something close, but then it was not at all. On the "mobile" PvP was miserable, asynchronous.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even now there are few such games - with such high-quality gameplay, such graphics, progression, etc. The strong competitors that are now coming out [on mobile platforms] - PUBG, Call of Duty - they are good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But even they do not have everything that makes World of Tanks Blitz strong. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, in PUBG there is no deep progression, so that you accumulate something, collect: "everything is mine, and it will remain with me." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is why we are cool. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And that is why we have been cautious for a long time with the new modes: we were afraid to break the core gameplay. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then they became bolder, began to experiment - and it turned out that it was very difficult to break the gameplay of Blitz. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you introduce new interesting modes, he begins to play with new faces.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tell me who is behind this cool gameplay? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does the game designer at World of Tanks Blitz do?</font></font></h4><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, a game designer is, in fact, the point of development of the project.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The one who is responsible for the ideas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the game does not have high-quality ideas, most likely, the game designer is underworking somewhere. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Traditionally, there is a controlled conflict between the game designer and those who are responsible for ensuring that the features get to the sale. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have these people called product owners. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our studio also has such a conflict, and this is normal: there are resources and desires, and they do not always coincide. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And although the roles conflict, at the same time they together develop a vision on how to make a feature in the best way and on time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nobody comes to us and says: it means we will do so. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, in many large studios the latter situation is not uncommon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We still dominate the dialogue.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Please tell about the fan modes in World of Tanks Blitz</font></font></h4><br>
<blockquote><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh yes, fan modes are the tastiest part of the job!</font></font></i></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not a gradual improvement and change in gameplay, it is an opportunity to do something radically different. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The year before last, they chose Halloween for a bold move, because Halloween is usually best visited by all sorts of non-standard things like fantasy.</font></font><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our game is historical, we cannot add orcs, elves, and so on to it any day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And on Halloween we can.</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mad Games</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> was born</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: A post-apocalyptic mode in which we added unusual abilities to tanks. Plus, two award tanks were made - with the participation of Peter Pound, the designer of the cars of the movie Mad Max 2015. I can‚Äôt say that this was our first fan mode: before that, we started the mode with ducks on April 1. But he had one problem: it was impossible to play him for a long time. It was a good experience. And when we developed Mad Games, one of the requirements was just replay value - that is, the player‚Äôs desire to go through the regime again and again. The second requirement: the regime was not supposed to completely turn off the player from the "standard" World of Tanks Blitz. The combination of these two requirements resulted in a change in the player‚Äôs property. First of all, these are tanks - and now they have become different, they have new opportunities, sides.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We had previously thought of creating special cars, there were many options. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same ballotanks from the "Big Tanks"; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, great mode. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at the same time, we wanted to release a mode that would emphasize and force to play with new colors all that the player already has.</font></font><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the pillars of our philosophy - the player must relate to our game with confidence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This, you know, like a bank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If I trust the bank, I know that I put the money there and at any time I can take them.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or trust in the company: I ordered something and I know that it will come to me. In the same way in the game: the player is ready to come into it and get his share of pleasure - and do it on those tanks to which he is accustomed. Accordingly, we did not begin to create other tanks (although these ideas periodically appear with us). We just added what we needed to the existing tanks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The success of the regime has not only affected us. I know that the Ships, with an eye on us, made their cool modes. And we decided that the player needs to be given high-quality gameplay that creates a lot of game situations and opportunities, and everything else - monetization, progression, and so on - all this is important, but secondary to the gameplay.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And we have a whole collection of fan modes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On May holidays came out a realistic mode. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The other day, our second Halloween regime "Revival" ended. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By Cosmonautics Day, we developed the ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù mode, which was very popular with the audience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I myself played 122 fights in a day in it.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How much does the audience of PC and mobile Tanks overlap?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúBig Tanks‚Äù is always the No. 1 game, which our players play in addition to us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we, of course, are highly dependent on the success of the entire franchise. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, we form a unique image of Blitz. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are still a less historical game, our bold regimes open the way for us to further develop.</font></font><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, they tell us: "You are a game about the Second World War." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But we are still not a game about World War II - we are a game about tanks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Variety.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, a significant part of this technique is historical. But we have a lot of "alternative historical" cars. There are cars from the anime universe Girls und Panzer; there are sega tanks. There are tanks that we ourselves invented: Dracula, Helsing. If the tanks are "Defenders" with Tesla engines, which, of course, did not exist. And there will be others - I do not want to just spoil it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we talk about the Blitz audience on PC and mobile devices - then yes, there is a segment that plays only on PC. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the bulk are users who primarily play on portable devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The presence of "Blitz" on the PC allows users to play wherever convenient. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So I have two large computers, there are laptops, a tablet, and a phone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If I‚Äôm at home - I play on the PC, in the country - I play on the phone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no such thing that after the appearance of the game on the PC, everyone went over there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, someone switched, and someone, on the contrary, played on the computer, and then returned to the phone or tablet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, our streamers are indicative: some went to the PC, and some remained to the "mobiles". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, Miracle (CHUDO8585).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe crisis of three years‚Äù - you will touch on this topic in your speech. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tell me more, please.</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose you have a project and it is growing very fast: extensively, capturing new areas. And at some point, new areas end. It‚Äôs like agriculture: first you cut down the forest, then you improve what has already been developed. Many games do not live up to this point. They begin to get bad results, and they simply close, believing that the project has outlived itself. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We also had difficulties. How did they manifest? You do something and expect the game to react like this. And everything happens exactly the opposite. For example, we introduced a popular pumping system that many games used, and an avalanche of negative comments fell on us. For a year, the players hated us for this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We did a lot of different monetization things, aimed primarily at new players. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We did them for a year, and then decided to see how they work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it turned out that nothing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, each solution worked separately, but together they did not give the desired result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They started to figure out why - and found different reasons. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it was just the analysts who did it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, the studio needs such analysts, if they are not, it will be tight.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And so many studios, especially mobile ones, are closing at such a moment, projects are switching to operating. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's all, let's make a new project in which we take into account all the mistakes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 2018, we did not do this.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And rightly so, because after a year new records were already set almost everywhere: in daily, weekly and monthly revenue, CCU, MAU, DAU, and registered users grew significantly. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I repeat, the most important thing is to find the gameplay. And the gameplay we already had, and cool. Why should we look for a new one? Instead, we began to look for what our problem was. And we realized that our project has grown, but we ourselves have not changed: neither the methodology of decision-making, nor the methodology of team work, nor the structure, nor the approaches. And when we changed all this, we began to show a stable result. After that, they made another qualitative leap - and switched from the studio of one project to the studio, which is developing several projects. This also required major structural changes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is, we had two qualitative leaps. The first (and the most important) - we realized that we were not dying, that we had everything to grow, we understood that it was necessary to change. The second is the emergence of new projects. There is still such a philosophy: we treat our studio as a project. There is a game - this is a project, it has bugs, flaws, but it brings some money, gives players emotions. The studio is the same project. And I like the idea. Applying a grocery attitude to the studio, it is possible to change a lot and achieve a lot.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, what bugs we fixed in the studio project: the game designer took the place in the studio that he should occupy. He is a generator of ideas and proper design, a backlog keeper. He is not the one to negotiate (this is also an important skill, but at some point, these negotiations may crowd out the design itself). He must be a designer and generator. Now he has all the possibilities for this. This has not always been the case, this state of affairs is achieved through procedural and structural changes. And they happened to us. I can‚Äôt speak for programmers, I work with them a little and I don‚Äôt know what suffering they have and whether they have it. But for game designers, this problem was obvious: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt hear me! I have great ideas, but they are not being realized. ‚Äù And we managed to fix it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And another point. Did you watch the "Big Bang Theory"? There, one of the heroes, Sheldon, periodically stood up in a pose: ‚ÄúI told you!‚Äù So we abandoned this pose. In general, as soon as we started fixing bugs in the studio, things started to grow. The key role here was played by the quality of the team. We hire strong, interesting people who like to play games and know how to create them ourselves. All our specialists have great potential. And the changes that have taken place in the studio allow us to show this potential. This does not mean that we are so kind here, we run around, we say, they say, come on, do some creative work. There are terms, there are obligations - this has not gone away. It‚Äôs just that now people have the opportunity to influence what they do. And it gave results that are manifested in cool numbers.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The fact that we decided on these new modes and that we managed to get out of the crisis and achieve what we have now is the result of the fact that we unleashed the potential of our people and correctly structured the studio.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of the conversation, please tell us about the topic of your report: ‚ÄúHow to set MAU records in 6 years‚Äù</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I will tell you what, where, how and when we specifically did to come to this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in the end it will become clear that we have not done anything revolutionary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most importantly, I just said: we have changed ourselves and structure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to do something, make an appropriate decision, you must have the right structure, the right ideas about what you are doing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, I will talk about specific technical solutions that can be applied to other projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the question is rather how to come to such changes, to decide on them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The eternal problem: there is a desire and there are resources. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resources are not enough to do everything.</font></font><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A colleague comes to me recently, looks at his backlog - and there are 300 tasks - and says: "How can all this be done?" </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I say: ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Man cannot do everything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He can only do what is needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But what exactly is needed is what needs to be understood.</font></font><br>
