Each room in Entropy House, an estate near Boston, where Shannon and his wife Betty have lived for more than 30 years, can answer this question in different ways. One room, neat and tidy, is decorated with rows of awards demonstrating the many achievements of the owner of the house. These include the National Science Medal, which he received in 1966, the Kyoto Prize - the Japanese equivalent of the Nobel Prize - and the IEEE Medal of Honor.</font></font><br>

This room is Shannon's Hall of Fame. </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Robert Lucky</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , Executive Director of Research at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, called his work the greatest achievement "in the annals of technological thought." And </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IBM's </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rolf Landauer</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> put Shannon's innovative thoughts on par with Einstein's. Even while working at Bell Laboratories as a junior engineer, Shannon formulated the basics of information theory. In a brilliant article for the Bell System Technical Journal, he outlined a broad intellectual field for studying effective packaging and electronic transmission of information. "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", this is what this article was called, is still the Magna Karta (Magna Carta) of the communication era.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shannon in his 75s, despite his completely gray hair, retained the smile of a mischievous boy on his face. Showing guests his awards, he looks almost embarrassed. A minute later he invites us to the next room. Its walls are covered with many diplomas and certificates within. One of them, for example, claims that Shannon is a "doctor of juggling sciences." The tables in the room are cluttered with all kinds of devices.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Their Shannon has been collecting all his life. He has a talking chess machine, a penknife with a hundred instruments and a pogo-stick with a motor, as well as no musical instruments. He built something on his own: a miniature stand with clowns-jugglers, a mechanical mouse wandering through a maze, a juggling mannequin of comedian U.K. Fields and the Throbac computer (Thrifty Roman Numeral Backward Computer), which considers Roman numerals. Shannon even tried to get a juggling Fields to show us his creation, but to no avail. ‚ÄúI love to build different cars, but it's hard for me to keep them in working order,‚Äù he muttered thoughtfully.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All of these gadgets show us a completely different Shannon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The one who cut through the corridors of Bell Laboratories on a unicycle, juggling four balls at once. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The one who invented jet-propelled frisbee and the "mind-reading machine." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This room shows us Shannon, who was constantly looking for new reasons for inspiration - and even built a chess machine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As his former colleague recalls, at one time Shannon played chess at work so much that "it caused concern for at least one boss." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Without a trace of regret, Shannon says: ‚ÄúI always pursue my own interests. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The final result and its value to the world do not particularly bother me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I spent a lot of time on completely useless things. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Impact of the Golden Beetle</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shannon's love for mathematical abstractions and all kinds of devices manifested itself at an early age. He was born in 1916 in a suburb of Gaylord, Massachusetts, and spent a significant part of his childhood there. Shannon loved to play with all kinds of radio sets - his father bought them. Shannon also really liked to solve the mathematical puzzles that his sister, the future professor of mathematics, asked him. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúEven as a young child, I was always interested in cryptography and all sorts of such things,‚Äù says Shannon. One of his favorite books is The Golden Beetle by Edgar Allan Poe, a mystical detective with a happy ending. Solving a mysterious map, the main character finds a treasure buried in the ground.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the University of Michigan, Shannon was equally good in both mathematics and electronics. A good understanding of both of these areas allowed him to achieve the first significant success: he was accepted to graduate school at MIT. After talking about a complicated telephone line switching system with Amos Joel, a recognized Bell Laboratories expert, Shannon prepared his thesis. In it, he resorted to concepts from Boolean algebra, such as: ‚ÄúIf either X or Y, but not Z, results in Q,‚Äù he was able to describe the operation of switches and relays in electrical circuits.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The conclusions made by the 22-year-old student turned out to be surprisingly deep: electrical circuits before construction can be tested mathematically, and not by trial and error. Modern engineers have long been designing computer hardware, software, telephone lines, and other complex systems using Boolean algebra. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shannon's thesis was called "probably the most important thesis of the century", but the author himself, as usual, belittles its significance. ‚ÄúIt just so happened that at that time, only I was well acquainted with both mathematics and electronics,‚Äù he says. And then he adds: "I always liked this word -" Boolean "!".</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After receiving his doctorate at MIT in 1940 (his thesis was on mathematics in gene transfer), Shannon spent a year at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With a theatrical whisper, Shannon tells how he once held a speech at the institute, and then the legendary Einstein entered the back door of the audience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He glanced at Shannon, whispered something to one of the scientists, and left the room. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Immediately after the speech, Shannon rushed to this scientist to find out what Einstein was talking about. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He, while maintaining a serious look, replied: "Einstein asked where our tea lies."</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How is the word "eureka" spelled?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1941, Shannon got a job at Bell Laboratories and worked there for 15 years. During World War II, he participated in the development of digital encryption systems. Churchill and Roosevelt used one of them to conduct transoceanic negotiations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As Shannon himself says, this work led to the theory of communication. He realized that using numerical codes, you can protect information from prying eyes. Accordingly, from interference too. In addition, these codes can be used for efficient packaging of information and further transmission on a dedicated channel.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúThe first thing I thought about [in terms of information theory],‚Äù says Shannon, ‚Äúis how to improve the transmission of information over a very noisy channel. This was an acute problem for telegraph and telephone systems. But when you think about such things, a wide range of applications [for a possible solution to the problem] immediately appears in the head. ‚Äù Answering a question about whether he had to experience an inspiration, after which he would like to exclaim ‚ÄúEureka!‚Äù, Shannon joked: ‚ÄúI have to, but I still don‚Äôt know how to spell this word.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The definition of information set forth in a 1948 article by Shannon is crucial in his theory of communication. Avoiding questions about the meaning of information (Shannon emphasizes that his ‚Äútheory could not and did not intend to solve this issue‚Äù), he clearly demonstrates that information is a measurable product. He showed that the amount of information in a particular message is determined by the probability that it will be selected from all messages that can be sent. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He defined the general potential of information in the system as its "entropy". In thermodynamics, this term refers to chance or ‚Äúconfusion,‚Äù as one physicist put it, ‚Äúsystems.‚Äù (The great mathematician and computer theorist </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">John von Neumann</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">convinced Shannon to use the word entropy. The fact that no one knows what entropy is, von Neumann argued, would give Shannon an edge in discussions on information theory.) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shannon defined a basic unit of information as a message representing one of two possible states. Later, John Tukey of Bell Laboratories called it a binary unit and then a bit. You can encode a large amount of information in a relatively small number of bits. It looks like an old Twenty Questions game. In it, you can also quickly calculate the correct answer by asking the right questions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Based on mathematics, Shannon showed that any communication channel has a certain maximum throughput, above which reliable transmission of information is impossible. In fact, with the help of cunning coding, it is possible to reach this maximum, but in practice this is impossible. This maximum became known as the ‚ÄúShannon limit‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The same article in 1948 states how to calculate the Shannon limit. But not about how to achieve it. Both Shannon and his colleagues tackled this issue later. First of all, it was necessary to eliminate redundancy from messages. In the same way that the economical Romeo encodes his message to Juliet to ‚ÄúI Tb lbl‚Äù, a good code first compresses the information well.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then the so-called correction code is added - sufficient so that the noise does not completely suppress the message. For example, a correction code for a stream of numbers may add the equation of a polynomial onto the graph of which all these numbers fall. And the decoder on the receiving side knows that any numbers that get out of the graph were distorted during transmission. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fact, Shannon‚Äôs ideas were too far ahead of their time to be realized instantly. ‚ÄúMany practical scientists at Bell Labs found this theory interesting, but not very useful,‚Äù says </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Edgar Gilbert</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. In 1948, he came to Bell Labs, including to work with Shannon. Vacuum tubes simply could not handle the complex codes needed to get closer to the Shannon limit. Shannon‚Äôs article even received negative reviews from </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">J.L. Oak</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , a renowned mathematician at the University of Illinois. Historian William Asprey notes that for a real application of the theory of information at that time there was no conceptual basis.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Only in the early 1970s with the advent of high-speed integrated circuits did engineers begin to fully use the theory of information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nowadays, Shannon‚Äôs ideas are used in almost all systems that store, process or transmit information digitally, from compact discs to supercomputers, from fax machines to deep space probes such as Voyager. </font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Information Theory and Religion</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Information theory from the very beginning captivated an audience that was much wider than the one for which it was intended. Specialists in linguistics, psychology, economics, biology, even musicians and artists sought to combine information theory with their disciplines. </font></font><br>
<br>
<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">John R. Pearce</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , a former colleague of Shannon and a distinguished professor at Stanford University, compared information theory (or rather, "widespread abuse" of it) with two other deep and misinterpreted scientific ideas: the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and Einstein's theory of relativity.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some physicists went to great lengths to prove that the entropy of information theory is mathematically equivalent to entropy in thermodynamics. According to David Slepian, a former Shannon colleague at Bell Labs, many engineers "just jumped on the tram footboard, not understanding the true essence of the theory." In 1956, Shannon's work inspired the creation of the IEEE Information Theory Society. Soon, economic, biological, and other subgroups appeared. In the early 1970s, the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory published an article entitled Information Theory, Photosynthesis, and Religion, which condemned the overwhelming spread of Shannon's theory. [Editor's note: in fact, an article by Peter Elias was entitled ‚ÄúTwo Famous Articles‚Äù and was published </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in September 1958.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ]</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shannon, although skeptical of some applications of his theory, was not limited in his own research. In the 1950s, he conducted experiments on the subject of language redundancy in his living room. They were attended by his wife Betty, who worked at Bell, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bernard Oliver</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , another scientist from Bell (as well as the former president of IEEE), as well as Oliver's wife. Someone called the first letters of a word or words in a sentence, and everyone else tried to guess the continuation. Shannon set up another experiment at Bell Laboratories. Employees had to count how many times various letters appeared in the letter, and what was the order of their appearance.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, Shannon suggested that applying information theory to biological systems might not be a stretch. ‚ÄúThe nervous system is a complex communication system that processes information in a very non-obvious way,‚Äù he said. When asked whether he believes that cars can ‚Äúthink‚Äù, he replied: ‚ÄúYou would! I am a car, and you are a car, and we both think. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shannon's work in the field of information theory and his love for all kinds of devices led him to a fascination with ‚Äúsmart‚Äù machines. Shannon was one of the first scientists to suggest that a computer can play chess with a person. And in 1950, he wrote an article for Scientific American explaining how this task can be accomplished.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In chess, things did not end. Shannon built a machine to "read minds." She could play heads or tails with a person and guess the bet. The prototype was built by a colleague of Shannon of Bell Laboratories, David W. Heigelbarger. The machine recorded and analyzed the opponent‚Äôs past moves and created models that would predict the next choice. Since human choice is almost always based on a particular model, the machine guessed in more than 50% of cases. And then Shannon designed his own version of the machine and challenged Heigelbarger to a legendary duel.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He also created a machine that could beat any human player in the hex board game, which was popular among mathematicians decades ago. Shannon built the board so that there were more hexes on the side of the person than on the opposite. To win the car, it was enough to "capture" the central hex, and then calculate the available options for moves. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The car could fire instantly, but to create the impression that she was considering her next move, Shannon added a delay switch to the circuit. Andrew Gleason, a brilliant mathematician from Harvard, with the words "no car can beat me" challenged Shannon's device. And only when Gleason, crushed to smithereens, demanded revenge, Shannon revealed to him the secret of the machine.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1950, Shannon made a mechanical mouse that could learn how to make its way through a maze to a copper piece of cheese without outside help (at first glance). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In honor of the hero of ancient Greek myth, who found a way out of the maze and defeated the Minotaur, Shannon called the mouse Theseus. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the "brain" of the mouse was enclosed in a set of circuits on vacuum tubes that were under the labyrinth floor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These circuits controlled the movement of the magnet, which in turn controlled the mouse.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/cp/in/bzcpinl-7p3smnbu3wkzuqyngg0.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When, in 1977, the IEEE Spectrum editor suggested that readers create an autonomous ‚Äúmicro-mouse‚Äù with a built-in ‚Äúbrain‚Äù that could go through a maze through trial and error, and then learn from it how to go through it without errors, his former colleague Shannon called him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I called in order to prove that Shannon had already built such a machine almost 30 years ago.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Realizing that the technology of the 50s did not allow cranking something like that, the editor still contacted Shannon. In response, he laughed and told how he led many people across the country. Curtains around the table with a maze hid the mechanism from the audience and were an important component of the device. When Spectrum solemnly presented the Amazing Micromouse Maze Contests in 1979, Shannon removed Theseus from his attic, loaded him into a car, and put it on a display window next to the winning mechanism.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Answering questions about the prospects for artificial intelligence, Shannon noted that modern computers, despite their incredible power, still "did not reach the human level" in terms of processing "raw" information. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He emphasizes that even the task of replicating human vision is so far too complex for machines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at the same time he adds: ‚Äúpersonally, I fully believe that in a few decades the machines will be able to surpass people.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unified Field Juggling Theory</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1956, Shannon resigned from Bell Labs (but worked for more than ten years as a freelance employee) to become a professor of communications science at MIT. In recent years, his new great passion has been juggling. He built several juggling machines and developed a unified field theory of juggling: if B is equal to the number of balls, H is the number of hands, D is the time that each ball spends in the hand, F is the flight time of each ball and E is the time when each hand is empty, then B / H = (D + F) / (D + E). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
(Unfortunately, the theory could not help Shannon juggle more than four balls at a time. He said his hands were too small.) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shannon also developed many mathematical models to predict stock growth and tested them - successfully, he said, on his own briefcase.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He was even fond of poetry. Among his works is an ode to the Rubik's Cube, a popular puzzle of the late 1970s. The poem ‚ÄúRubik's Cubes Rubric‚Äù is written on the motif of the composition Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-De-Aye, and one of the stanzas looks something like this (a free translation into Russian is given below): </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúRespect your cube and keep it clean. / Lube your cube with Vaseline./Beware the dreaded cubist's thumb, / The callused hand and fingers numb./No borrower nor lender be./Rude folk might switch two tabs on thee, / The most unkindest switch of all, / Into insolubility . [Chorus] In-sol-u-bility./The strangest place to be./However you persist / Solutions don't exist. ‚Äù </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Respect your cube, keep </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
it </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">clean </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and lubricate it everywhere. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But fear those who have this cube, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Shannon himself had a special talent, and he successfully solved the puzzle. According to Alvin Burlekamp, ‚Äã‚Äãwho studied with him at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and wrote several works with him, ‚Äúthere are solvable problems that are trivial, and serious problems that have no solution,‚Äù Berlekamp explained. Shannon possessed "fantastic intuition and the ability to formulate deep problems that could be solved."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since the late 1950s, Shannon has published little on information theory. Some former colleagues at Bell Laboratories suggested that by the time Shannon left for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he was ‚Äúburned out‚Äù and tired of his own creation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Shannon refuted these allegations. In his own words, he continued to work on problems in the field of information theory until the 1960s and even published several articles, even if he did not consider most of his research worthy of publication. ‚ÄúMost of the great mathematicians wrote their best works in their youth,‚Äù he notes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the 1960s, Shannon also stopped attending information theory meetings. Burlekamp offers a possible explanation: in 1973, he managed to convince Shannon to give his first annual lecture at the International Symposium on Information Theory. But at the last minute, Shannon almost refused. ‚ÄúI never had to see someone who is so afraid of the stage,‚Äù recalls Berlekamp. "The crowd looked at him like a god, and, it seems to me, he was afraid not to live up to their expectations." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the end, Shannon made an inspiring speech in which he anticipated the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe universality of feedback and self-referentiality in nature. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, Shannon disappeared from sight again. Only in recent years did his wife inspire him to attend small meetings and various laboratories where scientists work with his theory.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 1985, he unexpectedly came to the Brighton International Symposium on Information Theory. The meeting went on exactly until the moment the rumor passed that the gray-haired man with a shy smile, who appears here and there, is Claude Shannon. But some of the conference guests did not even know that he was still alive. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the banquet, the meeting organizers somehow convinced Shannon to turn to the audience. He spoke for several minutes, and then, fearing that the audience would get bored, fished out three balls from his pockets and began to juggle. People cheered him on and then lined up to get an autograph. As Robert J. McAli√®s, a professor of electrical engineering at the California Institute of Technology and chairman of the symposium, later remarked, it looked like "Newton himself appeared at a conference on physics."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Claude Shannon died in 2001 at the age of 84 after many years of struggle with Alzheimer's disease and is rightfully considered one of the greatest electronics engineers of all time.</font></font></div>
