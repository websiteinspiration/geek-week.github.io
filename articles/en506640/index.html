      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/506640/"><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">... in any phenomenon there are subtle components that, nevertheless, strongly affect its essence. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From Wikipedia</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Agile "captured" the world of information technology? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or have many already become disillusioned? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Because, even if the philosophy and approaches of Agile (Scrum) to management are completely unsuitable for a specific project, the teams still want to be on the mainstream, ‚Äúto be Agile‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And they get pseudo-Agile and deep disappointment in the mindset and one of its tools - Scrum framework.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first mistake of such teams seems to me to be the lack of understanding of the difference between </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
projects with an iterative life cycle model (with incremental buildup of the product‚Äôs functionality or without it), implemented according to the Fixed Price / Fixed Budget financial interaction scheme and, most often, oriented to the management of fixed project characteristics from projects with an adaptive (agile) Agile life-cycle model (which in turn is a variation of the above-mentioned iterative incremental life-cycle model), always focused on change management.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Those. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in addition to the predictive (Waterfall) and adaptive (Agile) models of life cycles (LC), there are also iterative incremental (a variety of which, as has already been said, are adaptive) LCs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the first key nuance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such a classification of LC models is given in PMBOK. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I now refer to the fifth version of the manual. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The sixth version has undergone some changes and, in my opinion, has become less informative in this regard.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The named scheme of financial interaction Fixed Price / Fixed Budget is the second key nuance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although, I admit that it is possible to develop products iteratively (with or without supplies) and not according to Agile, and without fixing the budget. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, non-profit products developed from a ‚Äúclean slate‚Äù (Green-Field Projects) for their own needs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But we are talking about outsourcing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the moment with the scheme of financial interaction is important.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the first type of project, the emphasis is on controlling the fixed characteristics of the project. Fixed Price - the primary scheme of financial interaction in outsourcing. The customer pays for the iterative (phased) implementation of the functional volume, i.e. for the implementation in advance of somehow defined and evaluated at the stage of sales (or Discovery) the content of the product (Product Scope) or work (Work Breakdown Structure). Changes are permissible and do not entail serious consequences (unlike Waterfall). But they are analyzed for feasibility (in the management processes of Change Requests / Enhancment Requests and customer loyalty). If approved, they require review and approval of newly established design parameters. Increments (deliveries) according to the results of iterations can be like when the customer, for example, wants to see the progress of the work visually, give feedback,gradually introduce new functionality, no.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Often occurring in such projects, the transition to the Time and Material scheme is a transition to a more trusting relationship with the customer, including with the aim of optimizing the manager‚Äôs labor costs for drawing up iteration plans and reports. But this transition does not always mean that the project takes on the features of Agile. Especially if the priority of management is still control over design parameters, not changes. Otherwise, a thorough analysis should be carried out, the result of which may be a change in the approach to project management and tools for its implementation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second type of project focuses on change management. The fundamental principle of change management, including the Scrum framework, is the principle of empiricism. An outsourced customer or a product company, when it comes to product development, is paid, in addition to implementing Product Scope, including experiment (empiricism) and changes. Or maybe even for a negative result. The decision regarding the continued existence of the increment may be negative (all or part of the developments may be thrown away), but valuable in relation to the experience gained, on the basis of which further improvement and, possibly, new experiments take place. From the point of view of common sense, there can be no talk of any strictly fixed plans, budgets, or dates in such conditions of uncertainty.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the particular case, as an option, you can fix the budget for testing hypotheses. With its full expenditure, dwell on what happened, draw the appropriate conclusions on the results. But in general - the issue of compatibility between Scrum and Fixed Price / Fixed Budget is not easy and requires analysis of many nuances and specific situations to consider the feasibility and ways of combining them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the customer in outsourcing is not ready to pay for the experiment, as well as for changes (processing functionality), it also requires fixing the content, budget, time frame, what kind of Scrum can we talk about? In my opinion, an understanding of this nuance at the stage of project planning and the choice of management approach eliminates a number of project difficulties and subsequent conclusions about the non-viability of Agile.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Case Study on the choice of approach to project management: an application for organizing passenger traffic for mobile platforms</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The paragraphs below indicate only key points for practical illustration of the above theory. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The names of existing applications are omitted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An exhaustive strategic and project analysis, as well as a complete list forming the main conclusions, are not given. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
1. Simulation of the assessment of the conditions and feasibility of development in the early 2000s. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Key points: Discovery phase ends with one of the main conclusions - investment in development is impractical. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The degree of technology development does not contribute to the implementation of the idea. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
2. Simulation of the assessment of the conditions and feasibility of development in 2008-2010.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Key points: Product Scope is not defined (in the future, the algorithms for constructing routes, pricing, and in general the functionality changed many times depending on newly emerging conditions), the passenger transportation niche is formed by taxi dispatch services, there are no analogues, a high degree of risk and uncertainty. It is advisable to opt for tools for managing a product development project (with investments, for example) with an adaptive change-oriented life-cycle model. It is also advisable at the initial stage is hypothesis testing (MVP). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
3. Simulation of the assessment of the conditions and feasibility of development today.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Key points: Product Scope with primary functionality is defined (in essence, the application being developed is a replica of existing ones), the niche of passenger transportation has been formed, high competition, and crisis. The Discovery phase today may end with one of the main conclusions: investment in development is impractical. But, if there are still arguments for the development of the product, then the project, for example, can be implemented (including by an outsourcing company) using an iterative life-cycle model with incremental buildup of product functionality and delivery of product versions to the services market. With regard to the search and testing of ideas for promoting the product, based on the general competitive analysis and analysis of the disadvantages of competitors' applications, etc.adaptive life cycle model and Scrum framework (a mixed approach to project management) can be used.</font></font></div>
