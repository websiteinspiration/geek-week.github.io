Vladimir Kitov, who has been working with IT for more than half a century, led programming teams at the MCC of the USSR Ministry of Marine and the Monolit Central Research Institute, led software development for the COSPAS-SARSAT international space rescue system and created a multi-terminal monitor for an EU computer. He worked as a top manager at DEC, SIEMENS, Technoserv, IBS, Fujitsu, wrote a textbook on system programming and several monographs, and now he is engaged in the history of computer science. </font></font><br>

‚ÄúMy work path can be divided into three periods: socialist (1968-1991), capitalist (1991-2011) and retirement (from 2011 to the present). </font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About the history of automated control systems in the USSR</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The history of ACS is not just the history of information technology. This is part of the history of the country, because in 1960-70 in the USSR a whole industry of automated control systems was created, in which about 700 thousand people worked. Electronic engineers, programmers, algorithmists, analysts, task managers: all of the country's numerous industrial enterprises had their own ACS departments, each of which employed about 100 people. That is, this is the story of an independent industry with all its ups and downs.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Take any modern enterprise - the so-called ERP systems are used to quickly inform and process business information. In the Soviet Union, their place was occupied by ACS. This is a whole technological ocean, subdivided into separate independent scientific areas - ‚Äúseas‚Äù. For example, process control systems (automated control systems for technological production - production lines and machines). Then the automated control system (automated enterprise management systems) - computer systems with which they informed the director, his deputies, chief accountant, heads of departments, industries, workshops and other managers to make managerial decisions.</font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first system in the USSR for a large enterprise was the automated control system Lviv, which was introduced at the Lviv television plant Electron in the mid-1960s.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Another IT-sea is OASU (Industrial Automated Management System). Who centrally manages enterprises, design bureaus, factories, research institutes in each industry? Ministry The Ministry of Defense, for example, included about 300 large arms manufacturing enterprises. Or, let‚Äôs say, OASU MRP - the ministry of radio industry, in the factories of which computers were produced EC computers, SM computers, Ural and others. Next - RASU, Republican ACS. 15 union republics, each with its own Council of Ministers, its own republican Central Committee of the CPSU, its own structure. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bk/cu/hr/bkcuhro28c75n0z025m3sjuz__k.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The task of creating the OGAS was included among the decisions of the XXIV Congress of the CPSU, held in the spring of 1971</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was assumed that all these many thousands of automated systems will be integral parts of the OGAS - the National Automated System, named after 1970. It began as EGSVTS - the Unified state network of computer centers. Back in 1959, my father Anatoly Ivanovich Kitov proposed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe EHEC to the Government of the USSR for a radical restructuring of economic management and planning of the national economy. The main propagandist and ideologist of the OGAS was Viktor Mikhailovich Glushkov. Unfortunately, he was not endowed with any authority by the communist leaders in the field of automated control systems throughout the country, and his proposals were not binding, but only advisory in nature.</font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Manuscript of Anatoly Kitov in 1959, dedicated to the Red Book project - a unified system for managing the national economy and the Armed Forces of the USSR</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
How were communist leaders ruled in the USSR? Simplified. A meeting of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU is being convened, for example, on crop issues or the production of tractors in the country. Suppose, the Rostov region is lagging behind - of course, I give it just as a conditional example. Then the head of the USSR N. S. Khrushchev or another major leader picks up the telephone and makes the secretary of the Rostov regional party committee an unpleasant verbal rumble: ‚ÄúYou are so-and-so, slob, why do your plants not work well? Why is the plan not fulfilled? ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/kn/av/59knavexmvmjpb-t0acf_1kccxo.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nikita Khrushchev did not stand on ceremony during public speaking, but expressed himself more sharply in a narrower circle</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- ‚ÄúIt will be done, Nikita Sergeevich! Let's do it! ‚Äù Then he picks up the phone, calls the factory: "Why, parasites, do not do it?" The director of the plant kosterit the heads of workshops and production sites: ‚ÄúI will dismiss, I will leave without a bonus! Why aren't you fulfilling the plan? ‚Äù Yes, because either the plans are unrealistic, either one of the workers did not change (say, washed down), or the subcontractors didn‚Äôt deliver the spare parts, and they would only deliver them at the end of the month. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But what does the head of the site think in this case? "Let me lie that the plan has been fulfilled, and at the end of the month, quarter or year, I will catch up with shock." Further, the shop manager lies at the enterprise level. The director of the enterprise lies to the secretary of the district committee of the CPSU. And so on all levels. There were even special terms such as ‚Äúhome registration‚Äù and ‚Äústorming‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And all because the Soviet bosses did not want to be removed from their posts, depriving personal cars, prestigious rations, state dachas and other benefits. And the more benefits were given, the higher the position was. After all, the USSR was a country of deficit distribution at all levels. So, although I was also a small leader ‚Äî the head of the department ‚Äî I also had warrants for getting scarce goods: sheepskin coats, muskrat hats, Japanese jackets, vacation tickets to Bulgaria, and then also a car. He regularly received food sets: a can of instant coffee for 10 rubles, a stick of Finnish cervelat and other scarce foods. You work poorly - they won‚Äôt give it. Therefore, at all levels lied. Everything seems to be fine according to the documents, but the result is unsatisfactory. The central place in management was occupied by the subjective human factor,whose role was proposed to be radically reduced by installing a computer. That is, with the introduction of a global computer system, it was proposed that all these reporting links, starting from each production site and up to the Moscow central government, be computerized and integrated into a single network. Sensors will record that the part has been produced, and immediately report to the workshop level. Then, information on the production of larger blocks and computer products will be reported to the enterprise level. And so on up. The computer does not lie. That was the idea, but it did not pass.that the part has been produced, and will be immediately reported to the workshop level. Then, information on the production of larger blocks and computer products will be reported to the enterprise level. And so on up. The computer does not lie.

Then, information on the production of larger blocks and computer products will be reported to the enterprise level. And so on up. The computer does not lie. That was the idea, but it did not pass.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main reason for this is the extreme indecision of the then stagnant Soviet regime. Anatoly Ivanovich Kitov in one of his letters ‚Äúupstairs‚Äù warned: ‚ÄúOne should not expect that everything will settle down by itself.‚Äù But the Khrushchev-Brezhnev power was too "weak at the knees" to decide on a serious project. She quietly expected that everything would somehow form without a global restructuring of the management of the national economy. Over the years, the situation in the country became worse and worse - first stagnation, then stagnation and finally the collapse of a great country. Everything is natural.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this is a pity, because the USSR, with its centralized planning and management, was ideal for the OGAS. I think that it is possible that under comrade I.V. Stalin the brilliant idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe EHREC / OGAS could have been realized. He was able to take the risk and go on the implementation of this expensive project, because, being a cruel tyrant, he remained a smart man and thought about strengthening state power. Still, it is no coincidence that he made an industrial giant from an agricultural country in a short time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then, with him, the Communists knew how to intimidate everyone well. As Stalin said: "Our scientists work well when 10-15 percent of them are sitting." I heard that even Sergei Pavlovich Korolev had forms: ‚Äúarrest such and such for failure to complete the assignment‚Äù and an empty field for the surname. As Academician Boris Evseevich Chertok, Deputy Korolev, wrote, the rocket and space industry, like the nuclear one, worked then under the laws of wartime. Everything was tough: for failure to fulfill the plan, it was possible to get a deadline.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One sometimes hears that with the then communication technology, with huge antediluvian computers, it was unrealistic to implement such a project. But such a judgment seems to me shortsighted. It was proposed to create the EHRCC, but no one said that the EHRCC should work on devices that are available. At one time, space flights and the atomic project were unrealistic. With direct and clear instructions from the leadership, as in these two cases, the global task posed by scientists could stretch up all the sectors necessary for its solution. Both communications and computers.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Back in the late 1950s, Anatoly Kitov argued that the country's leader should be responsible for automation in the rank of member of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee, and all work in the field of computers and automated control systems should be carried out exclusively, coordinated and implemented by a single state body of union significance - a separate ministry . Only in this way will it not be left to chance. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unfortunately, in the seventies in the USSR, motley opportunists in the face of former party and Komsomol nomenclature workers (usually poorly educated in the field of IT) began to massively attach themselves to the ACS industry. Huge amounts of money were spent on automated control systems in the country, and the effect of their activities was not high. Unsystematically and without any coordination, thousands of unconnected ACSs were created. As thousands of bricks are not yet a building, so disparate, heterogeneous, heterogeneous standard hardware and software do not in themselves form a single system. Rather, it was a discredit of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãautomated control, to which the term ‚Äúpatchwork automation‚Äù was attached. Some managers began to look skeptically at the acronym acronym itself.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In 1976, Mstislav Keldysh, already not being the president of the USSR Academy of Sciences, with his characteristic bluntness, said: ‚ÄúWe have poor computer peripherals and, perhaps, worse with their software ... It seems to me that I need to prepare and raise a question about changing the order of creation of electronic machines. There must be one organization - an association or a ministry - which, with the participation of the Academy of Sciences, will develop complex modern electronic machines, because further lag in this regard is unacceptable. " Thus, Mstislav Vsevolodovich practically word for word repeated the statement of Anatoly Kitov, made in 1959 in a letter to the head of the USSR N. S. Khrushchev.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intellectual meetings</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The elders regularly went to visit each other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Often gathered at my parents, who, I think, quite deliberately, sat me down somewhere on the edge of the table. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Constantly sounded songs, laughter, subtle humor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cementing foundation of the company was my mother Galina Vladimirovna. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dad's friends and associates called him the father of Soviet cybernetics, and my mother, as a joke, her mother.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These were not even gatherings, but a discussion of what excites them. The conversation has always passed on to science: computer science, ACS, programming, new ideas. For everyone, this was the most important thing. I thought that I had three senior friends from prominent scientists: Alexei Andreevich Lyapunov, Nikolai Panteleimonovich Buslenko and Viktor Mikhailovich Glushkov, who each time spoke with me. Before school, I had a big plush cat in boots, which I called Lyapunov. I recall with pleasure Igor Andreevich Poletaev, Nikolai Andreevich Krinitsky, Bashir Iskandarovich Rameev, creator of Zelenograd computers in Israel, Yakovlevich Akushsky. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another reason to get together is the arrival of one of the non-Muscovites. Leonid Vitalievich Kantorovich and his wife, who often flew from Novosibirsk, constantly came to visit us. He subsequently received the Nobel Prize. Victor Mikhailovich Glushkov came from Kiev. As a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, he constantly attended meetings in the Kremlin - to go through the Moscow River from the Kremlin to the House on the embankment where we lived was easy. He regularly came to us, including during lunch breaks between meetings. It was easy to feed his mother - he preferred potatoes with herring. I met him at the age of twelve, when dad took me to Moscow State University, where he gave a lecture on cybernetics in the Great Assembly Hall. I remember that at that time I was very shy of my age and my father tried to cheer me up.</font></font><br>

<i>   ‚Äî ,    , -    1964 </i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most importantly, the amazing spirit of these evenings. No rivalry, no struggle for priorities, no disputes "I am right, and you are not right." A calm and friendly conversation of intelligent, respecting each other people, for whom the main thing is to clarify the truth. Often, they were so carried away by the discussion that they continued the conversation even in the hallway, putting on a coat. So it was one evening, when I was already a student. In the morning you need to go to college, but on the hanger there is not my pretty worn hat from a rabbit, but a beautiful fawn is hanging. I had to go to study in it, and in the evening I began to find out who yesterday could change my rabbit for this fawn. It turned out fascinated by the discussion Lyapunov. I speak to his relatives on the phone: ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôll come and change my hat back,‚Äù and they answer me that he‚Äôs already left for Novosibirsk. I had to waituntil he arrives in Moscow again. But when I did come to him after all, he introduced me to another guest, Boris Vladimirovich Gnedenko, from whose textbook I was studying probability theory at that time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w4/tp/yl/w4tpyldg-a2m4yv4sjpldkrcews.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first edition of the textbook by B. V. Gnedenko was published in 1950.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Regularly recited poems: Pushkin, Yevtushenko, Rozhdestvensky, Samoilov, and sang songs: folk Russian and Ukrainian, military, ‚ÄúThere is only a moment between the past and the future‚Äù and others. Anatoly Ivanovich Kitov, who was a company hummer in 1940, with a special feeling performed ‚ÄúAt the Nameless Height‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarch of the Gunners‚Äù, and everyone sang along with him.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Each of these people aroused my admiration. They were great workers and intellectuals. Unlike subsequent more practical generations of scientists, they did not get involved in any rivalry for personal superiority, did not boast of their merits. My father never spent time on pointless criticism of the authorities, although he himself seriously suffered from it. He believed that ‚Äútimes do not choose‚Äù and that one must work conscientiously and selflessly at any time. For example, he never scolded either the country or its communist leaders, although his project "Red Book" was rejected, and he was expelled from the Communist Party, for which he joined during the war at the front. A year later, however, restored. We realized that he wanted the best for the country and its people:to unite the computers of all ministries and enterprises of the USSR into a Unified Computer Network (USSEC) for managing the country's national economy. Back in 1959, Khrushchev sent two letters to the CPSU Central Committee with his proposals and then continued to uphold these ideas. When, somewhere in 1971, he realized that the CPSU leadership, supporting the idea in words, would in fact never create an OGAS for the restructuring of economic management, switched to a more real problem - medical cybernetics, and became the chief designer of the Healthcare ACS.switched to a more real problem - medical cybernetics, became the chief designer of ACS "Healthcare".switched to a more real problem - medical cybernetics, became the chief designer of ACS "Healthcare".</font></font><br>

He was not in words, but in fact a true patriot of his homeland and a man deeply devoted to his family. Apparently, this is why the curators from the KGB freely let him go on scientific trips abroad. Including, not only as a part of delegations, but also one. </font></font><br>

These were some amazing people - people of the Renaissance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They had a property - they studied throughout their lives. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same Anatoly Ivanovich read biology books in the evening before going to bed, trying to understand the structure of the cell, the structure of the brain, and the root causes of oncological formations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When he began to travel abroad regularly, after fifty, he quickly learned spoken English and easily talked with foreign colleagues, lectured at American universities, and made presentations at conferences. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He had a unique memory. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He learned English for free reading of scientific literature at a military academy in the second half of the 1940s. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the main foreign language for him was German, which he had been fluent since the war.</font></font><br>

My father had two passions: science and sport. I don‚Äôt even remember him lying on the sofa or sitting in front of the TV - all the time at his desk. He wrote something, thought ... In the morning I woke up early - before school at 7 in the morning I ran with a friend along the embankment of the Moscow River. So, I wake up, and he is already sitting at the table. As for sports, he was the champion of Tashkent in gymnastics, a good tennis player, chess player. Every morning I did exercises and went to the CSKA pool on Leningradsky Prospekt and took me with me. A track was assigned to its Computing Center No. 1, where employees could swim at a certain time. </font></font><br>

The CSKA pool is located at the Aeroport metro station, and the CC is at the Begovaya metro station. It is nearby, one area. </font></font><br>

We arrived, the major who was in the post with the leader of the military unit for youth also missed me, besides I was in short pants. And so we entered the engine room. It was huge, about 500 square meters. Many electronic lamps and wiring harnesses. Then a visit-effect happened - the boss arrived and the computer crashed. The engineer on duty, the captain, began to rush lightning through this engine room, looking for a reason. The system failed to determine the specific lamp that failed. He took out a huge block in which there were 20-30 of these lamps - checked, then took out another. As a result, he managed. A very energetic officer, like everyone in his shift duty.</font></font><br>

In general, the VTs-1 is a separate story. In the 1950s, it was the largest computer center in the country and one of the largest in the world. More than 1000 people worked in it. There are 50 mathematicians alone, several hundred programmers - either 200, or 300. A whole army. Young people were mainly taken from the mechmath of Moscow State University and from other leading universities of the country. To get into this secret organization was prestigious. Good salaries, interesting work, provided housing. Now you don‚Äôt drag anyone into mailboxes, because everyone wants to travel around the world, and then in any case no one went, because they didn‚Äôt let them out - the border is on the lock. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Talented youth. Powerful scientific elite: Lazar Aronovich Lyusternik, Alexey Andreevich Lyapunov, Nikolai Panteleimonovich Buslenko, Igor Andreevich Poletaev, Oleg Vladimirovich Sosyura, Nikolay Andreevich Krinitsky and several others. A very strong middle link is the heads of laboratories, senior researchers, department heads. Basically, they were war veterans, people who went through the war and felt their calling. So was my father. Before the war, he wanted to be a nuclear scientist, studied at the University for two months at the Physics and Mathematics Department, but when he saw Katyusha, he realized that the rocket era was beginning and entered the Dzerzhinsky Academy's ballistic department. The first work is on the Queen. They made the R-1 rocket, an exact copy of the V-2. Stalin then banned any modifications - only copy, and to take off. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My father has an invention, fundamental articles with mathematical calculations on rocket topics. But then computers appeared, and this fascinated him. Anatoly Ivanovich believed that the foundation of the foundations is mathematics. While still studying at the Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy, he received personal permission from the head of the academy to attend seminars by Andrey Nikolayevich Kolmogorov at the mechanics department of Moscow State University. He believed that mathematics develops brains and enhances the general scientific culture. Therefore, he introduced additional education for all VTs-1 employees in mathematical courses, along with computer training and programming. New employees came from universities and were immediately sent to graduate.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And how electronic engineers were taught! By the decision of the USSR Government, the first Strela computers were delivered to the Institute of Applied Mathematics, where Keldysh was the director and nuclear reactions were considered; in the research institute "Almaz", where Raspletin created air defense systems; in the VTs-1 of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR, the VTs of the Academy of Sciences and the Scientific and Research Center of Moscow State University In the last two CCs, defense tasks were also considered, and the floor where the computer stood was closed - everything was secret.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the very middle of 1954, Anatoly Kitov signed an order for military unit 01168: ‚ÄúSend electronic engineers to SKB-245 to work together on the production of the Strela computer for the VTs-1.‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, the VTs-1 engineers were sent to where their Strela was made. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By specialization: one group of officers was sent to create an AU (arithmetic device), the other to RAM, the third to external drives, etc. Moreover, with weekly written reports on the work done. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, all the business travelers passed the exams of the joint commission of representatives of SKB-245 and VTs-1. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So taught and studied in the 1950s.</font></font><br>

After the Central Research Institute ‚ÄúMonolith‚Äù (PO Box P-6211), there was a period when I worked as the head of the laboratory of computer networks at the Institute of Cybernetics for about two years. There, for agriculture, an animal feeding control system was made. It is very interesting. As you feed a cow, she will give milk. There was a whole generation of ‚Äúfeeding pigs‚Äù programs created in the laboratory of my colleague Sergey Buryan: the Khryak-1, Khryak-2, and Khryak-3 complexes. Feeding cows - there, as far as I remember, up to 60 ingredients, from which, depending on the time of year, their food is formed. Now the Russian company Aplana-Europe, led by Igor Morozov, has created an interesting system for managing meat and dairy complexes for the UK. Now the power management of the British cows is carried out according to our Russian algorithms. </font></font><br>

At the very beginning of 1991, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) - then the main competitor of IBM - decided to open a representative office in the USSR. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the Soviet Union, EC computers were analogs of IBM 360 computers, and SM computers were DEC computers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">DEC made a great PDP 11/70 computer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I went through five interviews in March 1991 and since April I began to work with them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, he was the first Russian to be hired by the Moscow office. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not exclude that it is largely due to the fact that he led the creation of OBI - a competitive product of the IBM CICS system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the capitalist period of my labor activity is probably a different story.</font></font></div>
