A third-party view is useful not only for beginners, but also for those who are used to working in the same field or in companies with similar development principles.

Anton Chernousov has more than 15 years of his own experience in IT on various roles, now he is a developer advocate in Yandex.Cloud.

<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You have extensive experience in IT, you host one of the oldest IT podcasts in Russian and participate in a large number of conferences. It seems that you should have a clear and multifaceted understanding of the IT sphere. How do you see the modern landscape of the industry and what do you think about its evolution?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
If you constantly monitor what is happening, it may seem that we, as an industry, are developing steadily. But if you look back now, it turns out that a lot is developing in a spiral: technology appears, after some time it becomes mainstream, and later it repeats itself in a new round - albeit with new features, but by and large, at the core the same idea lies. It seems to me that over the past 15-20 years there have been 3-4 such cycles in different areas of technology.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Somewhere the period is longer, because nothing new has time to appear, somewhere shorter. In the backend, it seems to me, the cycle length is 5 years. Now all the most fashionable youth is connected with platforms and discovery service, but we have already gone through all this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In artificial intelligence, this cycle is much longer. Achievements associated with the use of AI, for the most part, are based on the achievements of the 70-80s, if not 60s. Nevertheless, there is a constant development. I think that the most interesting thing in this area will happen in another 10 years. Now the foundation for future technologies is being laid, and those who are seriously working on it now may just take a step that will allow us to reach a new level.</font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what do you say about the homogeneity or, rather, the heterogeneity of the level of development of IT companies? For example, working in a certain segment or only in large and very advanced technology companies, you see only part of the industry and it might seem that there is a basic set of practices that is applied everywhere. Which is most likely wrong.</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
All companies are different. And not only because they use different technologies, which, in turn, determine the methods of conducting and organizing processes. The fact is that the culture of the founders greatly affects the composition of the team, and people in the team influence what will be arranged.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we take two similar companies with approximately the same number of employees, then most likely they will work differently precisely because the basic approaches and practices used most often are very correlated with the ideas laid down by the founder. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is especially noticeable in small companies, the differences are felt even at the level of slang and jokes.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company's culture defines both work processes and their structure.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The larger the company, the more difficult it is to maintain a separate culture. When the founders manage to bring the cultural code through the whole organization, it‚Äôs very cool. One way to maintain the company's internal culture is to pick up similar people. But sometimes, of course, you need to hire people with different views and other experiences so that they bring fresh ideas to the company. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the other hand, people regularly move from one large company to another. Then this culture gradually begins to level off. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Small companies in this sense are often monolithic. Therefore, you can choose for work the one that will suit you, where there will be people with whom you are pleased to work.</font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Are the companies very different in terms of introducing engineering practices? It seems that some modern technologies are used just everywhere. </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, I see many reports at our conferences, where Kubernetes appears. And I‚Äôm starting to think that everyone who needs it has already figured it out and use it very well. Then, of course, it turns out that this is not true.</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Yes, that‚Äôs not true, and so at TechLead Conf we‚Äôll try to make a</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> roundtable discussion</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> about using Kubernetes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It should be noted that Kubernetes has a new way of organizing products. The practices that are born around him are a new approach to organizing the code. They form a way of development as a whole.</font></font><br>
<blockquote>Kubernetes,    ,         ,    .</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we want our team to develop, we are forced to bring into it the practice of organizing work with code, testing, deployments, and working with incidents. Education within the team of these technological practices directly correlates with the kind of people in our team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If our team consists of people who are only ready to code, i.e. engage only in the development of functionality, it will be difficult for them to try on these actual practices. But if everyone in the team understands that the goal is not just to write the code, but to release the finished product and convey the functionality to the end user, and therefore they are ready to expand their area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility, then they will quickly absorb these practices. If the team is completed and processes are established in it, then a new person, even with little experience, but an open mind, can easily learn it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this sense, internships organized by large companies are very good. This is a serious resource for any technical lead, because it allows you to teach accepted practices and tools from scratch. Retraining held specialists is more difficult. If a developer is used to doing one kind of work from and to, if he is not really worried about what happens after he has committed the task, then changing his way of thinking will be difficult. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The challenge to each technical team is to introduce the necessary technological practices so that the team is sufficiently homogeneous. Homogeneity can significantly reduce the risks associated with the development, debugging of errors, problems of scaling and sharing knowledge. If team members possess all the necessary skills and tools, then the knowledge between them is transferred easier and easier to assimilate.</font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How do you think, how well do companies succeed in introducing relevant technologies? </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Hard to tell. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At conferences, we often see success stories, and if they talk about problems, then about minor ones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, single products achieve success, and many die without having time to saturate the market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we do not know how many initiatives have perished.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think 10-15% of teams use good development practices.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, in each individual team, of course, a different subset of these good technological practices will be used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The set of practices suitable for a particular team may depend on technological and business constraints and on people who work in a team. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What practices or even domains of engineering problems most distinguish technologically advanced companies from less developed ones?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's make it clear: the thoughtless implementation of any practice leads to a lot of problems.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The level of maturity of the team may not be enough to implement some practices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be very small, but at the same time a mature team from the point of view of introducing practices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or maybe a huge corporation with great resources, but an immature team, in which you can hardly do anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is the technological and organizational maturity of the team that needs to be operated on, speaking about the applicability of certain practices. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, let us single out practices </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">directly</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> related </font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to development</font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Code quality assurance approaches can be distinguished as a separate domain and implemented gradually: some at earlier stages of team maturity, and some much later.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, even at the earliest stages of team maturity, you can implement the practice of writing automated tests that will improve the quality of the code. Covering code with tests is a debatable issue: from basic functionality or critical sections to total coverage of code with tests. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another simple practice that you can implement is the definition of done. You can start monitoring the performance of task setting by writing to each task how it will be received. This simple practice will help improve our manufacturing process from the start. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Or you can monitor the quality of the code by implementing code review. This is understandable practice, but it may not bring significant benefits, and there will be a lot of overhead costs.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Actually, implementing code review as a practice is not so simple. Because, firstly, it involves a different development model in terms of setting the problem and accepting the result. It used to be normal to take a rather voluminous task, write a huge chunk of code, and then commit it. But such a development method is not suitable for applying code review, because it is impossible to predict a large piece of code: the reviewer in it will be lost and spend too much time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is, in order to introduce code review practice in a team, it is necessary </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to set tasks in a different way</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and introduce the practice of small commits. There is a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">study</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that the optimal length of a commit is 100-200 lines. It is not fast to accustom a team to such a change in the process. Moreover, this is only an organizational matter.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is still a purely technical issue. To implement code review, you need a good tool that will allow you to write comments, do merge, etc. There are tools built into the development environment or in the code repository - you need to select them and start using them. It takes time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, you need to decide who will conduct the review. In developed teams, there is good practice when one of the team members does one review and the outside one does the second. In large companies, for external reviews from time to time attract developers from neighboring teams who can express some opinion. Double review significantly complicates the development cycle, but it improves the quality.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, it is important to determine the strategy for how we conduct development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In each domain, you can identify the initial practices and gradually improve. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, you can gradually collect metrics about team work. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Metrics are always a very controversial issue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are they needed and which ones? </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Obviously, in order to control something, you need to measure something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you do not measure, then you do not control.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To manage a complex machine such as a team of people, a technical person must operate with a set of metrics.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, you can collect such a metric as lead time - the time from the appearance of the task to its delivery to the final consumer, including all the time while the task was in different queues. This allows you to better plan the work of the team and product development. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For one specific task, this metric does not give anything. But it allows with a certain probability to predict how long the incoming task will become available to customers. This metric is already associated not with the team itself, but with the business, and helps to more reasonably answer the business the question of when something will be delivered to the client. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We discussed part of working with code and quality improvement practices. Tell me, what methodologies for working with tasks are relevant in technologically advanced companies and how did they evolve?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At some point in time, tasks were evaluated exclusively in hours. In general, customers are very fond of the task being evaluated in hours, because hours and money are very conveniently connected. But the teams began to go through this story in a different way, for some the score in the watch evolved into a score in arbitrary units. To evaluate the fact that one task is slightly more complicated than another, an intermediate scale has appeared. Then the next transition happened, when they began to evaluate tasks, simply scattering them in baskets: complex, easier, simple, etc.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Which practices the teams use is highly dependent on external conditions. For example, in outsourcing it is difficult to do, and in product development, especially in startups, this practice is quite easy to implement. But this does not mean the maturity or immaturity of the team, but only about the conditions in which the team is. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is the cyclical development that you talked about applicable to methodologies?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
No, I talked about cyclicality in terms of technology, not practice. Because the practices are actually developing, new ones appear regularly. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, previously it was not customary to conduct retrospectives. This organizational practice essentially did not exist. If there was a debriefing, then this was not a regular practice with a prescribed scenario. And now for many teams this is one of the natural and obligatory rituals.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another practice that did not exist before, and now it is actively used in many </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">high-</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> tech teams, is </font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">post</font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - </font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mortem</font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . This is the practice of describing the incident: what happened, how we struggled with the incident, and what needs to be done after we overcome the crisis. At present, the practice is quite well developed and there are good patterns for organizing post-mortem: how the situation itself should be described and the actions taken, how to complete the post-mortem, what further actions the team should take to prevent similar incidents in the future </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(ed.: More details can be read, for example, in the report </font></font></em><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAccidents Help to Learn‚Äù </font></font></a><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">)</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As far as I understand, not many teams in Russia use post-mortem practice, although it can seriously affect the quality of the product and reduce the risks associated with downtime or accidents. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What can be the criteria for choosing suitable practices for implementation? When is it worth trying new products, and when is it better to wait for others to have successful industrial experience?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In large companies, where there are many different teams and different technological projects, one of the strategies is to reduce the number of different technologies that are simultaneously used within the company. This is necessary so that the technological stack is not washed out. But at the same time, of course, you need to try something new so as not to stiffen and not lag behind progress. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Good practice in this case is </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tehradar</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. The practice of maintaining the technical radar has become popular with Martin Fowler‚Äôs light hand and allows you to evaluate the readiness of the technology for use in new products. Conditionally promising technologies fall on the radar, and with its help we are trying to understand how suitable they are for use specifically in our conditions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Inside the team, it may look like this: the technical radar has one owner or those responsible for certain zones (frontend, backend, data storage, cloud technology, etc.). The owner regularly reviews new technologies and sometimes tries to apply them in some small products, which is when these technologies appear on the techradar. If they were successfully applied and it seems that the technology is suitable for the team, knowledge is disseminated within the team, and this product or technology approaches the center of the technical radar. This makes it possible for other teams to consider it more seriously for use in their tasks. When the technology is in the center of the techradar, then it can and should even be used for any project within the team.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The same is with technologies that should be excluded from the company's turnover. They gradually move farther away from the center of the radar. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- From the point of view of practices, are technologies and tools very different, for example, development environments and practices and management methodologies? Is it worth it to separate them?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Yes, it seems to me that they should be separated. For technologies, tehradar is a great tool (however, do not forget that it must have an owner). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As for the tools, here, it seems to me, the situation is this: if the tool helps the developer to make his work more efficient, then the company's task is to provide them with an engineer, if possible. For example, buy a development environment, an appropriate tool for organizing software development or for storing artifacts.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And the application of practices, as I said, depends on the maturity of the team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The more mature the team, the easier it is to implement some practices. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In </font></font></em></strong><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">another interview,</font></font></em></strong></a><strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> another TechLead Conf speaker Dmitry Maslennikov expressed the following thesis: if we know that others have worked, then it definitely should work with us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do you think about this?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think that development is in some ways similar to farming: we grow our code.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And very much depends on what soil we do it. One soil needs some chemicals and fertilizers, and the other needs others. In principle, you can sprinkle everything with the same, but the result will be very different. It is the same with practitioners: somewhere they will work well, but somewhere not very. Perhaps precisely because the level of maturity of the teams is different. It does not depend on the number of people in the team, but rather on the ‚Äúquality‚Äù and cultural background.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, in teams used to working in custom development, where everything is measured in hours, the practice of measuring working time is very simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if a person who has never worked in this area gets there, then for him it will be breaking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if a person who is accustomed to operating time on a task finds himself in product development, where time evaluation is not very used as such, at first he will be perplexed how to report back. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's just a different mindset, and changing it quickly will not work.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Blitz. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who is the techlide</font></font></h2><br>
<em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would like to finish with a little blitz about who the technical expert is and where his place is in this splendor of engineering practice. When we asked the TechLead Conf Program Committee the same thing, </font></font></em><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">opinions were divided</font></font></em></a><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , so it‚Äôs interesting to know who you see techlide. </font></font></em><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is Tehlid a role or a position?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
It seems to me that not a role and not a position, but the quality of a person.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Frederick Brooks has a wonderful example of how a development team should be arranged in Mythical Man-Month. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He draws an analogy with a surgical team, in which there is a chief surgeon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our situation, this is the very technical leader, that is, the person who determines the rules of work and the style of behavior within the entire team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He is authoritative enough from a technical point of view to be listened to. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it seems to me that this is a quality inherent in a person, no matter what position he occupies. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is the value of techlide for business?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The value is that techlide forms the rules by which a complex system works.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any complex system is usually hierarchical and works according to the rules. Tehlid forms or very strongly influences the rules by which it works. The more efficient the system is, the more profit you get. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How does the technical presence in the team correlate with its success and the quality of the final product?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In order for the product to take place, several conditions must be met: market demand, sufficient resources for the sale of the product, and proper quality implementation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It cannot affect the demand for techlides, the role of products is strong here. Techlide resources are indirectly affected, for example, by hiring the right people. Most significant is his role as a person who forms the rules by which a product is sold. The technical task is to make the product</font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was created with high quality.</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> As a result, the product can still have some problems related to business functionality or market mismatch, but this is not the technical responsibility area. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Given the necessary resources and needs in the market, techlides can significantly affect the quality of the product. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What should the techlide be able to do, should it work with its hands?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
First of all, Tehlid is well and deeply versed in technology, knows how to understand new technologies and apply the skills gained in some technologies when working with other technologies. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, the technical lead should influence the planning in terms of the very metrics that it collects as part of the process.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And in my opinion, he should work with his hands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Otherwise, he will simply cease to understand both technologies and their limitations. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Should technical team be the coolest specialist in the team? </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The coolest language expert on the team may not have leadership skills. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And leadership is important for techlides. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is Tehlid the level of a company or team? </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is one of the informal leaders within the team. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Maybe a few techlides in the team? </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, technical backend and technical frontend, because these are very different technology stacks. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is it normal if the team does not have technical lead?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It‚Äôs normal if there is someone who peers outside, and someone who grows the next techlide inside the team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, a person with the technical lead potential should still be.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without techlide, the system will cease to be stable.</font></font></blockquote><strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How is techlide different from a senior engineer? </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is not necessarily the same person. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because senior is a person who can make a product from start to finish and has all the necessary technical competencies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, perhaps, does not have leadership qualities in organizing the process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He can be an excellent fighter and do his job perfectly, he can even be a mentor or implement individual independent projects, but, for example, the influence on the whole development can be entirely outside his comfort zone. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How is tehlide different from timlide?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Timlid aims to grow people, and techlide - processes within the team.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One person can combine both directions, but as a rule there is a bias in one direction. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Tehlid and STO - a different level?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
It seems that techlide is a small service station. Although STO thinks much more about business and is more immersed in the business component of the team. The service station should think about salaries, the cost of ownership of the code, and overhead. But in terms of the technological component, service stations and techlides are very similar and strongly overlap. From these people, it seems to me, just the good service stations should grow. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How to become such a person?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Once a journalist asked a Nobel laureate how to become a Nobel laureate. The answer was: "First you need to learn from the Nobel laureate." It seems to me that the same story is with techlides.</font></font><br>
