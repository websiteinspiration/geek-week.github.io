<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, there is an experimental tram, which sometimes went along one of the routes as part of the tests. The autopilot is tested in a closed area, and in urban areas - an active assistant to the driver of a car driver. The tram driver rides with his hands on the control, but it is the autonomous autopilot that is being tested. The tram is visually no different from the usual one, because together with the manufacturer we crammed the instrument blocks far below the panels and brought the interfaces to standard screens. The only thing - he can see several cameras under the windshield, hidden under the skin of the radar and a GPS sensor on the roof. Yes, sometimes we hang lidar for debugging purposes. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/kx/cr/dwkxcrbqaexcfvvvjvzlzeqiyza.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the tests, we learned that the rules of the road and the real situation on the roads, even for a tram, are very different things.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, a tram is an ideal sandbox for a complete autopilot of a car. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have already implemented it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our cheats:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We know the route and have a guarantee that our vehicle will not go anywhere with it. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can drive ahead and mark the points with traffic lights and so on, so that it is easier for the system to recognize them.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A tram cannot change lanes to lanes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most of the autopilot‚Äôs load is tied to ‚Äúwhere to taxi now‚Äù and thousands of scenarios, and we have nowhere to taxi.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It slows down almost instantly and a little sharply, that is, forecasts of the movement of other vehicles on the road are less complicated. </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What really is the problem is with people at stops who try to climb first, risking their lives. </font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Test stages</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the first two stages we did autopilot in closed areas (plant \ depot \ site in front of the depot). A tram can move along a route, stop at stops and open doors, let pedestrians, cars pass and stop in front of obstacles. At the same time, we developed an assistant driver who was already tested in urban conditions. The assistant consists of two main subsystems. Speed ‚Äã‚Äãlimit (OS): ensures that the driver does not exceed the speed (for example, according to the rules for technical operation of trams, bridges cannot be driven faster than 20 km / h, and in tunnels - 10 km / h. Arrows must be passed at a speed of 5 km / h, etc.). The other is auto-braking (AT), making sure that the driver does not crush anyone: it slows down (until it stops completely) in front of road hazards, red traffic lights,closed arrows. In this case, the control of the tram occurs in conjunction with the driver. This allowed us to smoothly test different parts of the drone in successively more difficult conditions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Finally, we are now in the process of testing the autopilot on a live route. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As part of the assistance system tests, we ride the real route at the moment, but our tram does not pick up passengers at stops and often does not stop at them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not visible from afar, and no one reads the inscription ‚ÄúRunning in‚Äù, especially in places where there is a single 17th route. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, often the people, assuming that we will be standing at the bus stop, boldly go against us.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those same people</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If in the case of co-pilots of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">agricultural machinery</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">combines</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> it is important for us to ensure the maximum efficiency of grain </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">harvesting</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and not to fly into a tractor, then the situation is different. It's about efficiency, but the main thing is not to bring down anything. And nobody. This also has an economic justification, because a tram that got into an accident is not only a cost for its repair, but also a simple expensive vehicle in a depot, that is, lost profit, and also often a simple whole line for a long time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the other hand, we have a radar and already three cameras to keep an eye on what is happening. This means that we can very accurately identify obstacles.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The problem is that the tram often intersects with people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Moscow, people stand right on the edge of the path on the platform and seem to sway in the wind. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our collision avoidance model does the following conditionally:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Detects obstacles and calculates their trajectories, possible behavior.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It determines the moments of intersection with our trajectory and the time before that.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It reduces speed in advance and notifies or slows down urgently. </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All this is complemented by a radar search of obstacles ahead. </font></font></li>
</ul><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cl/69/vb/cl69vbnh3pl61awjhce5koo-ynu.gif" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Pedestrians in the model are things that can move at speeds of up to eight kilometers per hour on foot, jogging or jumping. They have almost no inertia, they have small dimensions - in general, a solid random. And in no case should they be crushed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Specifically, we are currently working on a more promising multi-hypothesis model. We understand that pedestrians in this place can either walk along the platform, or stand on it, or cross the road along this path. Well, if none of the models fits, then already in this case a person is classified as inadequate, and then yes, a solid random, we shy away from him in all directions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first firmware releases could not drive to a halt: unpredictable people were standing too close. The tram driver turned off the co-pilot on that trip at each stop.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You can, of course, reduce the possible level of anxiety of the model near the stop (we know where it is, the route is fixed) and increase it along the way. This is a good option in order to solve the porch problem, but ineffective if some hero nevertheless jumps out of the way. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I had to build skeletal models of each individual pedestrian (including in the crowd, which is not a very trivial task) and monitor the position of the joints. Now the tram thinks that most pedestrians rarely travel with their backs forward. We collected a more or less interesting sample of pedestrians running across the road and trained the neural network to see the intention in characteristic positions. It turned out well. Glory to modern technologies that allow cramming as much computing power into a small box as on the entire planet at the dawn of the space age.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have stops - at ground level (taking into account the terrain along the route), and we already know how to predict movement well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not knowing this feature, we asked for the preparation of the first prototype in 2018 to make an emergency, counting on an ordinary hard stop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hit and then flew into the salon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The driver said: "I warned you: hold on tight." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Passengers find this very rarely; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am sure that with emergency braking, almost the entire interior will fall.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Traffic lights</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When a driver arrives on a new route, they ‚Äúdrive him‚Äù into it: he makes one or several trips along the new route with an experienced carriage driver, who rolled this route hundreds of times. We also ‚Äúroll‚Äù the system into the route, mark it in advance, which ensures high accuracy of the system. The second unpleasant feature of the route - drivers make the same mistakes that the autopilot in the first tests without marking the route, trying to recognize the signs and control their movement. This is encouraging. By marking the route, accuracy was achieved.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Knowing the exact position of the traffic lights allows us, firstly, to lower the requirements for the accuracy of the detector (if it is mistaken where 100% traffic is not there, it is not very critical), and secondly, in deciding on the reaction to the position of the traffic light. At a particular intersection, we know for sure which of the traffic lights belongs to us (and which does not apply), where it has a stop line, how much it has a green period, and what kind of signal is permissive for us. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we don‚Äôt know the topology of the intersection, then, having passed on the flashing green, we can start to slow down on the red traffic light-understudy located on the far side of the intersection. But in our system this is taken into account: the distant traffic light regulates the passage precisely through the beginning of the intersection, and not through the end.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If this is a prohibition signal, then you need to calculate the time of arrival at the traffic light and the possible speed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ambient conditions are very important for emergency braking. If the rails are wet or icy, if it is not correct to brake properly, the wagon will go by, you will either have to cut the rail brake (by the tram, by the way, there are three different brakes), or try to smoothly take the tram out of the skid and brake in the normal way. A rail brake breaks paths, for example. Actually, therefore, our speed profile (or calculation of the braking distance) takes into account these conditions, otherwise you can fly out of the way \ go to the user.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/io/ku/joiokuolh1mhdl5nem1eqyxjz3g.gif" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Calculation of the stopping distance is done from the curvature of the track, a specific section of the route, the state of coverage. This means that it is harder to slow down in the rain, and easier in the heat. The tram ‚Äúknows‚Äù the weather by recognizing what is happening on the street and reacting to the first cautious actions at the beginning of the route and along its course (that is, the co-pilot will react to the onset of rain). There are several traffic profiles (we collected them from fixed-line trams, so we know who usually exceeds, but Mosgortrans, of course, will not ‚Äúhand over‚Äù drivers: they helped us a lot) - from ‚Äúrain‚Äù and ‚Äúsnow‚Äù to ‚Äúsun‚Äù and "Ice". You can pre-select and firmly pin any of them from the interface. By default, the tram is aware of the environment itself.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, if the driver does not respond to the prohibitory traffic light, the tram will first start to slow down, and then gently brake. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here we were waiting for the second block of surprises. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The co-pilot's early releases were careful and stopped the tram a few meters from the traffic light. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Drivers sadly shook their heads and said that in Russia such an autopilot is doomed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out that you need to get up more tightly, otherwise, for example, the tail of a long tram can stick out at the intersection. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, now the robot asks for several runs of the route with the operator in order to learn all the features, and knows which traffic lights you need to get up tightly.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Crossroads</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next portion of woeful shaking of the head befell us at the crossroads during rush hours. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The tram, which in the morning passed the intersection with a bang, was stupid. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It turned out that at a busy intersection in the heads of drivers - neural networks, in which the priority "drive faster" will prevail over security. And they are rubbed almost close to the side of the tram. Movement means a high threat of collision. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then the most interesting thing: how to configure the system so that the tram can move in such difficult conditions and so that the system does not work continuously during braking. Therefore, you first need to start moving, this will change the reaction of drivers, and then again you need to evaluate this reaction. This is one of the most non-trivial tasks.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4a/ai/dv/4aaidvbfxox16hgff2oaxjy_2m4.gif" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second feature is idiots on the roads, which fly off to the side from minor ones and rush on. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since the real situation during rush hours is often accompanied by repeated violations of the rules by others, the driver often wants to take control so that the tram does not become cautious. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We made the ‚Äú10 seconds of freedom‚Äù button when the system shuts down and restrictions are removed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most often, the driver uses it now at ‚Äúlocked‚Äù intersections. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The frequency of use of this button is one of the KPIs by which we evaluate the quality of the system.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to come to a brighter future </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first level is avoiding collisions, assisting the driver, responding to vivid threats faster than him. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the second level, there was a driver control mode: it switches the arrow along the route, controls the speed of the sections (the driver can now enter the turn faster than safe speed or can stick the 15th running into ice), but the tram will not accelerate faster than the profile speed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We can implement further levels in closed areas. The tram moves under human control. A co-pilot takes him along the route, takes into account the situation on the roads, at times better protects the tram and others. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And a brighter future is a fully autonomous tram.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Installation was tested on Vityaz and Bogatyr (this tram is not yet found on the roads). Everything is controlled by them through the CAN interface module. No non-native modules in the cab, all through system interfaces. Equipment - a camera on glass. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u8/lh/lp/u8lhlpdrfmf-eiyzdiipluy_0p0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We use POE cameras for industrial vision with different lenses (you need to look far ahead, wide on the sides). The radar is more interesting: the review is 160 degrees, the range is 150 meters, the rain breaks through. We also need a high-precision GNSS sensor for navigation and integration units with the tram itself. Processing takes place on site, the 65 TFLOPS processing unit (looks like a large heatsink with ports). As you can see, this is not a Belarus tractor for autopilot, you can get more expensive equipment here.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Moscow and other cities are moving towards light rail transport. There are approximately 300 developed tram networks in the world. They are best made in China, Russia, Turkey, and are developing in Europe. In China, the development of the tram network is crazy because it runs on the regional budget, and the metro on the federal one. The budgets of the region are more easily allocated and more active than federal ones. The other day we signed a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">contract with FiTSCO - the largest Chinese rail operator</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , we are launching our system in Shanghai, and we will have the first case of a Chinese tram. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In Russia - 1,500 trams. In the world - 30 thousand. Production - only 2,500‚Äì3,000 per year, that is, now we will equip existing trams with the second or third level, and then we will move on to integration with manufacturers.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You already know about </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">our co-pilots for combines</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tractors</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , now you know about the co-pilot of the tram. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is still a shunting locomotive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All this equipment in terms of market size is a third of the automobile. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not a miserable interest, but a third. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in this market, only we are now with such technologies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So it‚Äôs very interesting not just to observe how the world is changing, but to change it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I‚Äôll also note from surprises that this very radar is of our development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because at first we needed to collect data from a low level to obtain more accurate models in neural networks, and then somehow word for word we put together the first prototype - and away we go. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About how to collect the radar, I think it is worth telling separately if you are interested.</font></font></div>
