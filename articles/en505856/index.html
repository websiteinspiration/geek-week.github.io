<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I watched Tron as a child and the computer network was a fairy tale for me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then there were Hackers who added romanticism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were disputes with friends that Linux is cooler than Windows without understanding what operating systems are.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Low speed internet with time lag. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Disposable cards with scratch fields, under which there were logins and passwords. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">House lokalki appeared in Russia, they grew into entire areas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of these, the first local Internet providers were born. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The administrator, billing, installer and technical support was a neighbor, a little more enlightened than you yourself. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And here we slow down the story. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lokals were built on unmanaged equipment, the qualifications of administrators and network engineers left much to be desired. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Uplinks were narrow and driving traffic outside of LAN was expensive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not only was the network technically quite low-tech, network owners often had no understanding, and there was no desire to improve anything - money is flowing, the subscriber base is growing (and where to go, there is no competition).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All in all, my BLT drive has just moved to AWOL</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff8/c84/4c6/ff8c844c6a60d9b660fa212e4041ee82.gif" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Young inquisitive minds tried to get the most out of available resources. Somewhere, a chip worked with the purchase of one scratch card and the simultaneous activation of several users. It used to be that logins / passwords on cards were generated using rather stupid algorithms, and by searching it was possible to find a suitable combination.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In LANs, more advanced script kiddis taking advantage of the fact that traffic could be sniffed, logins and passwords were collected, sessions were initiated under other people's access details. Again, the provider could completely uselessly use the user login, consisting of the contract number, which simply was a continuous sequence each time incrementing one at a time, and the passwords were simple and easily sorted out by improvised software. And I came across such situations even on freshly built networks of the federal, rather than the small-town provider in 2007. The schoolboy who had taken away the neighbors and his mother were being handled by the police. What the situation ended for the child then I do not know.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The fact is that unauthorized access was recorded only because of the urgent complaints of the affected parties and the greed of the schoolboy, who, having become impudent, substituted his neighbors in the internal network segment for substantial money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The federal provider did not have access control mechanisms sufficient to secure its subscribers.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the information that is available to me, I can be from 900 to 1200 times more effective than a person</font></font></h2><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So: unmanaged equipment is evil. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Managed equipment is good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If there is anyone to configure it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We set up VLANs for each subscriber device and got rid of schoolchildren thirsting for someone else's traffic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, and uplinks fell in price, introduced unlimited tariffs everywhere, reaching for other people's minutes or megabytes became pointless.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The general tendency is such that upon reaching a certain technical level and after the end of the active construction of networks in the city, the providers in the struggle for income begin to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù the number of engineers and administrators of active equipment. For federal officials, this looks like a reduction in the number of local staff, remote monitoring and network management. In fact, the load on one specialist is growing and the number of errors due to human carelessness is growing. So the incident is already from our days - the VLAN provider ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù leaked and the network flooded with spurious traffic and the Internet in several offices of one client buying the service of organizing a single network for the entire network of offices. Detection of such situations was not provided, the client‚Äôs offices sat for half a day without the Internet straining their admins. After that,how an embittered client made his way through the ‚Äúturn off / turn on / reload‚Äù call center operators to the third provider‚Äôs technical support line, which sits at a distance of half the country, and not just a neighboring city, fixed the problem.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Several years ago, in one of our clients, we saw a situation where the switch of a mobile operator was not fully configured. This allowed fraudsters to pick up and in transit drive roaming traffic through a telecom operator. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, I almost did not encounter successful targeted attacks on the infrastructure of telecom operators (if we exclude the abuse of holes in the mechanics of any registries of prohibited sites and curves of infrastructure settings). This is the specificity of the fact that the average qualification of the administrators of the provider is higher than that of other companies without IT specialization. All critical infrastructure is usually inaccessible from the outside. It turns out that it is easier to withdraw the customer base or some significant commercial information from some other office than the provider.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In our own experience, repelling attacks is a common occurrence. Some of our resources should be accessible from the outside - various personal accounts. The purpose of such attacks is to gain access to machine capacities for further spamming, to use servers in a zombie network to attack other servers, and mining. We deal with such attacks by tightening security policies, setting additional rules on firewalls, constantly monitoring the load of resources, running processes, and a system of alerts about suspicious activities. cron and Zabbix are our friends and helpers: D</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The situation is a little complicated by the fact that in order to quickly scale up capacities, sometimes it is necessary to quickly connect the cloud capacities of the used data centers where our solutions are located. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, another attack vector arises through the infrastructure of the data center, and for us it is an increase in risks, because we do not always know how the security is configured by the specialists of the data center, since this is their area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our decisions, we try to use third-party software that specializes in network security - it would be arrogant to believe that our experience in billing systems will allow us to provide maximum network protection without the involvement of specialists and specialized products.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am very old, but I still remember that MCP is just a chess program</font></font></h2><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Still, I need to justify the use of Brute-Force in the title of the article and say something about modernity. Normal setup of active equipment excludes the work of such crude methods from the provider itself. Therefore, the focus is shifted to specific customers and the infrastructure that they often deploy on their own or receive with default settings. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At risk are IoT devices, computer equipment with open network services. This is if on some prepared site you make too many mistakes during authorization, then you are restricted from access and hang up a timeout for attempts from one network address or for connecting to an account. But enumeration of passwords to some local router or server, accessible from the outside, can last a long time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In modern realities, the mechanics of fraudulent schemes with spoofing phone numbers and spam mailings stand out. Deception at the crossroads of technology and social engineering.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To minimize risks and protect subscribers from telecom operators, fraud control systems are used. In fact, fraud control is an algorithmized way to detect suspicious / different activity from the provider‚Äôs network, and to apply pre-defined scripts for additional verification and notification of responsible persons. Depending on the vendor and the cost, the functionality may differ, fraud control systems can be fully software or be a hardware-software complex. The fraud control system itself is not a panacea. A precedent from our experience: the operator we served was connected to one of the Big Four operators as a superior operator. This large operator has a rather sophisticated fraud control system.But during the May holidays, no one was monitoring the surges and deviations recorded by fraud monitoring. During the holidays, the attackers drove a large amount of traffic through the operator. Then the engineers went out of rest and away we go - monitoring SIM-cards, SORM, FSB, monitoring replenishment, tracking locations, etc. When such a situation arises, analytical reports are required from the telecom operator at the request of law enforcement agencies or a court decision. We, as a billing service organization, are involved in the process if the operator‚Äôs specialists themselves cannot extract the necessary data accumulated during the billing process or normalize them correctly.FSB, replenishment control, location tracking, etc. When such a situation arises, analytical reports are required from the telecom operator at the request of law enforcement agencies or a court decision.

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A separate security hole is smartphones with WiFi turned on, which search for networks they know by broadcasting the SSID. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such smartphones can be tracked using special devices that mimic the network familiar to the smartphone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A smartphone, seeing a familiar network, actually gives the password to the attacker, in an attempt to connect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this is already a threat beyond the competence of telecom operators. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you, the reader, are paranoid, then turn off Wi-Fi when leaving your home on your smartphone! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although that is me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the reader is paranoid, then he already does it without reminders.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So I created my digital clone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Able to think like you and me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I called him Clu</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4x/3d/rt/4x3drthd6bncl1yhkxmk1db5mkk.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we generally assess the situation on the market, then of the large and very demanding security companies, our solutions passed information security checks at three companies from the Big Four and several banks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our solutions were checked for vulnerabilities by specialized software and responsible employees on the part of the operator / bank, after which an opinion is issued on admission to the internal infrastructure and work with data.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For medium-sized operators, the situation is much worse. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There we have to use our groundwork for fraud control, because the customer simply may not have a separate specialized solution and give recommendations on ensuring the security of deployed solutions, recently this market segment has become more willing to use the option of placing BSS solutions on our site.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seems to me that on Habr√© the majority knows what SORM is. Providers duplicate traffic within the framework of SORM, give user data at the request of law enforcement agencies and court decisions. This is another area of ‚Äã‚Äãinteraction with subscriber data, a lot depends on the quality and timely interaction with these resources for the operator. We have accumulated valuable experience in this area that allows us to comply with the requirements of lawmakers and hand over networks to regulatory authorities in a fairly short time. In this direction, we have to carefully monitor all changes in this matter and respond to them promptly.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the context of combating a pandemic, control mechanisms are introduced that are uniquely identified by people as an attempt on privacy. Data collected by operators is used to estimate the density of citizens in different locations and to control the contacts of infected individuals and devices. It is difficult to overestimate the significance of the data that is now provided by telecom operators and the opportunities that open up for their use. The consolidation of a huge amount of sensitive data opens up new vectors for attacks. And if this data will not be stored by telecom operators, who for decades built up protection and learned from their mistakes, then this causes a reasonable concern. How well-assembled the bases will be protected and access will be controlled will not be reliably known. Unclear,what will remain of the controls in a few months, a year or two, when the epidemiological situation returns to normal. What do you think about this?</font></font></div>
