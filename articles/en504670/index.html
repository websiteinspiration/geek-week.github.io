<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why I decided to write on this topic</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 Initially, I did not plan to write this article, because </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I thought that hardly such information could be of any interest to anyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And how surprised I was when I found out that many are curious to delve into this area. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, how is training in programming now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or can the teacher help the student learn a language other than the standard for the Pascal ABC school curriculum, provided that it is not a specialized lyceum, where </font></font><abbr title="Programming Languages"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PLs are</font></font></abbr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> taught from elementary school</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(and after all such educational institutions are present in almost every city, but not every student has the opportunity to get there). </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The beginning began.</font></font></i></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
I see this article as an approximate reflection of the lessons of computer science in an ordinary comprehensive school, and what an ordinary student faces if he passes a single state exam in this subject. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And one more reason has recently appeared. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All my exams were postponed for a month, so I preferred to remove the growing tension with ... amm of creativity, probably, if you can call this daub from letters that I see now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I apologize in advance for tongue-tied tongue and other crap that can make it difficult to read (I'm sure there will be punctuation, spelling, or factual errors) and really hope you enjoy it.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Introduction</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 Probably worth starting with who I am to write something on this topic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am a student of the 11th grade secondary school, in which two computer science teachers work, as expected, with a completely different approach. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, it is precisely because of these two different methods that I experienced on myself during the entire training period that I had a certain opinion that I would like to share.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My opinion about computer science lessons at </font></font><abbr title="Municipal Budgetary Institution of Secondary School"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">MBOU SOSH</font></font></abbr></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 First of all: most teachers are interested in teaching strictly as part of the school curriculum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is understandable, they are paid for it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So if a student has a desire to learn something new, then he should always say so. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it is not a fact that the teacher will support such aspirations, or even give advice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But sometimes it happens that the teacher himself expresses a desire to teach students something that goes beyond the framework of the educational process, but, unfortunately, this happens infrequently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This practice is not carried out in my school.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the exam in computer science</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 Now this exam is a mixture of mathematics, algebra, logic and programming. Of course, the school provides the basis for passing this exam. But only the first part, which is 72 points, which is catastrophically small and not enough to enter a good university, especially if you do not score the desired 100 points in other subjects (and this is if the university does not have a certain bar in the number of points for each subject, which is often present). And then, to get the same 72 points, you need to have an understanding of recursive algorithms, one-dimensional arrays, and other smart things that can be passed in passing at a lesson or not at all. Of course, this is not all 72 points, but at least half of them are exactly those who give and receive.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second part consists of 3 programming tasks and one on number theory. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in the end it turns out that to solve more than half of the tasks, you just need to know programming. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But knowledge on other topics is also necessary. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sample tasks</font></font></i></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Well, here are examples of numbers that are similar to those included in the options: </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
At the end of the article there will be answers, you can check yourself and write how many and which of the numbers you decided correctly</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Programming in the classroom, or the story of how the Pentagon was hacked instead of computer scientists by the humanities</font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h5/w0/xp/h5w0xpdkq_vs5qxn9aobukbkug4.png"><br>
<br>
<b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Grade</font></font></i></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
9</font><b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> or Groundhog Day</font></i></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> First, you need to describe the lessons before grade 9, and only then write about the main action. I don‚Äôt remember telling us in detail what arrays are, how to work with them, or how the program iterates in principle. Instead, we solved many examples of translating numbers from one number system to another, or problems of transmitting information over a communication channel using different methods. In general, sometimes it was interesting, sometimes these were the next computer science lessons that we were hatching. Of course, any lesson is useful, but obviously for several years in a row transfusion of water is ‚Äúabout nothing‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But in the end, the 9th grade comes, and according to the training program, they began to ‚Äútrain‚Äù us to solve tests. This means that in the usual lessons, which were held once a week, the format of the lesson was only changed for those who took it. Now it was a monotonous resuscitation of the same numbers with which we started a couple of years ago, without the possibility of at least somehow escaping this mutual responsibility, while the rest of the students learned to work with computers, since only from the 9th grade they were entrusted to us .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the school year went on and on, and we, the handing over, solved all the same tasks from the first part, without even touching the second, where there were so coveted numbers with programming or commands for the robot. As a result, a week before the exam, I independently learned how to solve one number from the second part. And this was not programming, although each of the graduates read at least one </font></font><abbr title="Programming languages"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">YP</font></font></abbr><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. But I must say that someone still got acquainted with such an inaccessible discipline. These were students who did not even think closely about computer science, as well as about the exam. While the dealers diligently calculated how many megabytes per second in the communication channel, and how long a file with such a weight would be transferred, our classmates wrote simple programs with formulas, or wrote ‚Äútrojans‚Äù from the Internet to compilers. But still it was programming, though not so hot. That is, we can say that we, as a class, have studied Pascal. But everyone who passed the OGE in the 9th grade could not write a line without an error, which many joked about.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Time passed, and exams were passed. Someone entered other educational institutions, but some still remained to gnaw at the school granite of science. And here it is worth pointing out that in some schools of my city, after the 9th grade, there is not even such a subject as computer science. Thus, in order to learn something about the simple structure of the program, or about how it is better to declare variables, or about where and which conditional operators can come in handy, it was necessary to unselect the teachers from the school routine (or simply run after them with questions) and practically interrogate, but there is a high probability that the teacher himself may not know anything about the questions that he was asked. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well hello high school</font></font></i></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One way or another, the tenth grade has come for me, during which we studied the problems of sound, picture and text. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can say that at a plus or minus decent level, each of those who passed the exam was studied only in the 11th. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then, with tutors or on their own. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But even having basic knowledge, we did not proceed to the second part. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The last time I was in a lesson (it was just a day before the quarantine was announced) we solved simple problems with logic and parsed not so simple recursive algorithms. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But still, these numbers are in the first part, while in the second I sometimes figured out with 2-dimensional arrays (for example, in the second part, 2 numbers are allocated for solving problems using the code, one number with errors in the code, where and need to be fixed).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Total</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 Probably, if the pandemic hadn‚Äôt happened so ‚Äúon time‚Äù, our teacher would once have said: ‚ÄúHey, guys, maybe today we will analyze task number 24. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not know what it is? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the same error number that you have heard so much about. ‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, we have what we have, there's nothing to be done. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deletion also did not contribute to advancement in the study of material, rather the opposite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, instead of weekly classes, we only have promises that we will begin to study soon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Something like this is now the case with teaching programming in a regular school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you do not take the initiative, do not constantly ask you incomprehensible things, and do not study the manuals yourself or with a tutor (or any person who wants and can help you), then most likely you will start writing programs at the university. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unless, of course, you get there!</font></font><br>
