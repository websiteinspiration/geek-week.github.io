<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Hello everyone! A lot has happened since I wrote blog posts about Aeron ergonomic chairs 18 years ago. Some of those records are so old that they themselves can go get the first higher. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Oh, and again: Stack Overflow is about 10 years old! Wow! Therefore, I decided that in honor of such an event it would be nice to put together our old team and recall what it was. I want to tell you about everything that happened, but most of all I want to sort through the history of Stack Overflow. Looking back, it‚Äôs much easier to say what we did right, and where exactly we messed up. Therefore, I will try to highlight all the good and not very in a series of posts.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And one more thing: in a few weeks we will launch Stack Overflow Teams, the biggest update in the history of our system, and it will be very cool. I'll tell you more in detail in the next post! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today will be part one. I want to talk a bit about what the developers of the site did before Stack Overflow, why it was created at all, what the earlier versions were. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When the Internet was in its infancy, the Usenet system existed, which made it possible to create primitive discussion forums. When programmers had problems with the code, they could ask a question on the Usenet forum (they were called newsgroups, not forums (although they had nothing to do with the news - there simply weren‚Äôt any on Usenet)).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As soon as the world wide web appeared, from a technical point of view, Usenet instantly resigned. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We programmers immediately switched to thousands and thousands of web forums, where we began to ask our questions.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the largest forums at that time was called Experts Exchange. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Financially, the first version of this site was not successful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As it turned out, they went bankrupt in 2001. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Subsequently, the new owners acquired their assets and resurrected the site using a very tricky business scheme: they took money for answers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Their business really went uphill, but it caused some difficulties.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Problem number one was that programmers searched for the information they needed on Google, and not on Experts Exchange. And Google only shows free, open websites, not the ones you have to pay to access. Therefore, the owners of the site decided to cheat: when a Google robot friend knocked on them, the site gave full-fledged questions and answers to them, and when ordinary mortals tried to get to the same page, they received encrypted answers and instructions for paying for access to them (if I remember correctly , at that time it was necessary to give $ 250 per year). Most of the programmers did not return to the site after that.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second problem was that the EE (Experts Exchange) site could still give you a free subscription, but provided that you answered a certain number of questions. As it turned out, the main people who wished to get this subscription were far from the best programmers in the world, and in order not to pay, they wrote quite useless ‚Äútips‚Äù for show. The quality of responses on the site has decreased. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For a long time (five years for sure), programmers ran into EE in a search engine, clicked, found that the site was paid, spat and continued to search further for free answers to their questions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I kept wondering, is it really so difficult to manage a discussion forum on the Internet? For the sake of laughter, I wrote one of these in Visual Basic over the weekend (I‚Äôm not joking, by the way. Therefore, I like to say "Yes, I will do this in VB over the weekend" when developers complain that they need a year to introduce some feature). Therefore, I decided that someday there will be one among nine million smart programmers who decides to devote to EE and creates a free forum - this is just a matter of time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And you know what? No one moved. And I was waiting and waiting.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here's what else I wrote over the weekend (well, in two weeks. Quietly there, let‚Äôs lie beautifully) - a message board for this blog. And for the first month of work, we sold seats for $ 90,000. Hooray! So I started to think, and what if we blind two concepts together: we replace EE with a free website, and we will pay for it by posting information about vacancies? This way we can get rid of bad EE and allow developers to calmly perform their work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the meantime, I kept thinking: ‚ÄúDamn, it‚Äôs so obvious, someone has to come up with something like that.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But it was not there. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I decided to turn to one of the Fog Creek programmers (now Glitch), talked about my idea, to which he gave me: ‚ÄúWell, yes, the idea is cool, but I like working with FogBugz‚Äù. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And time passed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And finally, at the beginning of 2008, the developer / blogger Jeff Atwood contacted me and said: ‚ÄúHey Joel, I'm thinking of quitting my job and becoming a professional blogger. You‚Äôre a blogger - what do you recommend? ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To which I replied: ‚ÄúJeff, I have a better idea‚Äù and told about his venture to combine a message board with a site of questions and answers for developers. It took me more than a week, but in the end I persuaded him. We started discussing ways to make our site cool. Jeff started working on the code in April 2008, attracted two more programmers to the project (Jeff and Jarrod, who are still in our company), and the three of them were able to launch a device called Stack Overflow in September 2008.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9aa/42b/580/9aa42b5803a2321bb968cb9d976d96a8.png" alt="image"></div><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And so began the era of Stack Overflow. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Stack Overflow site was better because it was free, but it also had a bunch of ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù (I quote it because we stole it from other network pioneers), which made it a very, very good source of answers to programmers' questions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We wanted our site to be like a game with bonuses for answering questions, so we introduced a reputation system. The more you answer, the more bonuses you receive. A similar system existed on Slashdot and Reddit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Earning a reputation, you also receive the privileges of a moderator on the site. Thus, it turns out that the site is moderating itself, which is very cool.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Instead of putting Java programmers in one forum, and C ++ specialists in another, we just threw everyone into one sandbox and included the ability to add tags to questions. We dragged this idea away from flickr (who still remembers flickr?), Which, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, stole it from del.icio.us (no longer exists) ... Go look there, but the point is that the tags were in fashion and allowed Stack overflow function efficiently.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most importantly, we realized that one person asks the question, and the answers are viewed in the thousands. Therefore, we decided to optimize the system so that it was convenient not for one, but for many people. We literally have one question can have a thousand views. Therefore, we decided to sort the answers by the system of votes. And for the same reason, we optimize questions and answers so that they can be useful to other people. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is curious that when Jeff and I started the project, it was somehow all the same to us whether it would become a business, whether it would bring a lot of profit. We created Stack Overflow because the network was filthy at that time. We believed that the bulletin board would pay us bills, and in parallel we would bring something good to the Internet, and that was what motivated us to work ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt care about the rest.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, everything turned out to be much larger than we expected. Today the company has 250 employees, it makes a profit and has allowed millions of people to learn how to code and understand the new, super-complex world of APIs and frameworks in which we live. But we just wanted to make the Internet better. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I met a lot of people who started a business, simply because they wanted it. Paul Graham once compared this to a mother-daughter game. They didn‚Äôt care what kind of business it was ‚Äî they simply wanted to "be entrepreneurs." Which is strange, because being a businessman is actually not so cool. It is very difficult to overcome the extraordinary difficulties, pain and stress that are associated with starting your own business if you do not have superhuman motivation to help the world.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An entrepreneur becomes successful when he really wants something to exist, and since it is not, he will be hunched over until it appears. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we launched Stack Overflow, we did not set ourselves the task of opening a large business; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">we just wanted developers to have the opportunity to turn to someone for help, while others had the opportunity to flare their minds, giving advice. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This ends the first chapter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I still have something to tell you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next part will be about how, thanks to a small fraction of the gamification of Stack Overflow, the company's business went uphill. </font></font><br>
