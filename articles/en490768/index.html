 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
About how game companies work, on Habr√© wrote more than once or twice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The nuances of the gaming industry are known to many. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But few people know about how work is organized in companies from the sphere of cloud gaming. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This article will give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe internal kitchen of this industry using the example of the domestic company Playkey. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Under the cut, we reveal the nuances of organizing work processes, talk about the principles of selecting and implementing ideas, communication in a team, and the responsibilities of developers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have questions, ask in the comments.</font></font><br>
 <a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does the company do?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Playkey specializes in cloud gaming and everything related to it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The domestic company is a veteran of cloud gaming, it began even when this area itself was the lot of geeks, and not the mainstream, as it is now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just in case, it‚Äôs worth recalling that cloud gaming is when all the hard work of processing the graphics of the game is performed on a remote server, a ready-made ‚Äúpicture‚Äù arrives on the gamer's computer screen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to Playkey, representatives of this niche are Google Stadia, GFN, PlayStation Now.</font></font><br>
<br>

 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How many people are on the team and who are they?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now the team consists of 30 people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are 10 developers, 3 testers, 2 marketing managers, 1 SMM specialist, 3 system administrators, 2 product managers, plus a finance department, a lawyer and a couple of specialists in other areas. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vx/tu/sm/vxtusma9_h2ob-kjyrv_wnglnx4.jpeg"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And yes, there is Belyashik - the permanent mascot of the project team, which by personal example shows how you can enjoy life 100%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He can be called the Mastermind. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's a cat.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From idea to product</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The process of making important decisions in Playkey is as follows. It all starts with an idea - a new feature, product, partnership, or something else. Any employee can offer an idea. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order to be accepted, the idea must be reasoned. Figures and facts are desirable that allow us to prove the validity of the proposal to the team that makes the decisions. It includes the founder of the company, the product owner and a few more people. If the author of the idea managed to convince most of the representatives of this team, then work on implementation begins. In some cases, the life hack ‚Äúconvince the founder‚Äù is used - it is difficult to resist his charm and charisma.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/323/e9f/00d/323e9f00d5d3c65d37169eb0bb64cad5.jpg" alt="image"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A good case study is the implementation of a distributed gaming project. The idea is that owners of powerful gaming PCs, miners, rent out the resources of their machines to other Playkey users. The plus is that dedicated servers are not needed, there is no need for data centers in different regions of the country. When the user wants to play, the system selects nodes, miner computers that are geographically located near the gamer. This allows you to reduce ping and increase the enjoyment of the game.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, the concept of distributed gaming was proposed by one of the employees in 2017. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the topic of blockchain and decentralized systems in general became very popular. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The idea was voiced and well substantiated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out that distributed gaming makes it possible to reduce the cost of renting stationary servers, as well as increase the number of users - gamers from various regions, and not just those locations near which there are Playkey servers, would become customers. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, it was decided to begin implementation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The development of the hypothesis took a long time, the creation of technology is also not a quick matter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A year and a half has passed from the moment the first idea appeared to the test implementation, and now the project is preparing to go into open beta testing in March 2020.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From development to testing</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As in any IT company, testers play an important role, all of them are good programmers. Each of them can write code and disassemble, analyze someone else's. They are mainly engaged in functional testing and the development of automatic tests. It is impossible to verify everything manually, and a person, even if he is a super professional, makes mistakes from time to time. Therefore, whenever possible, automation is introduced, unit tests, integration tests, etc. are run. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
True, ‚Äúhard skills‚Äù are not enough. Practice has shown that the company somehow does not really take root in those who are not fond of games. Actually, all team members deal with games, but developers and testers are more than others. It is clear that if you do not like games, it will be difficult to work in such a niche. This is the case when work is fun.</font></font><br>

 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Product and project management</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Products are universal soldiers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They develop a strategy, understand how the product should work, look and what impression to make on the user. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in the case of Playkey, they also perform the functions of analysts and project managers. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/-0/3p/kx-03p8y7ltzzyu0rdimomzs7ti.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Playkey is presented on the market not only as an independent product, but also as an additional service from partners, for example, from telecom operators (say, TTK). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Playkey is offered to the operator‚Äôs customers as a separate service or ‚Äúbun‚Äù as part of the tariff. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With this scheme of operation, the service is embedded in someone else's eco-system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For normal integration, it is necessary to organize interaction between the company and the partner, coordinate development and testing, coordinate marketing activities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In such cases, the products turn into projects.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communication of employees and organization of work</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The company has two offices - in Perm and Moscow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, there are employees who work remotely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For communication, Slack is used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a main chat, and special channels for individual projects and teams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The chat structure is branched and it‚Äôs convenient - everyone communicates on the case, and Slack has the opportunity to demonstrate a screen, which is often required on phone calls. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As for the organization of the work process, for about a year and a half a scheme with two product teams was used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first worked to achieve optimal parameters for the first session and the first purchase. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second - tried to increase the playing time of users, and also was engaged in improving the quality of the gaming session.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/8d/v9/ii8dv9ivo5wfencfgzw90vwdi5g.jpeg"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now a different format is used. Everyone has a common project strategy, a common goal. Products are engaged in searching for ideas, setting goals and testing hypotheses leading to goals. For each new ‚Äúfeature‚Äù, its own team is assembled with a set of necessary competencies, and after a successful release it is reorganized for the next ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Directly in development, a combination of Agile and Scrum is used, which has proved to be most effective. The first stage of work is design. And then there are daily cycles. Work meetings are held both in the office and online, but more often in the office, since there are few remote employees. Although, the designer works from Spain.</font></font><br>
<br>

 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The life cycle of technical tasks is familiar to anyone familiar with Kanban. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The planning cycle is weekly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, design, then the task is commissioned, a code review is conducted, then testing, preparation for the release and the release itself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All development tasks are divided into client, server and billing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each team also provides technical support in its area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/833/d25/f22/833d25f22dd35c150cd67f1a51bd9053.jpg" alt="image"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Jira and Confluence are used as tools for task tracking and knowledge accumulation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to this bundle, it is easy to trace the fate of each task and find all the necessary information about a particular project component or business process.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/077/56f/33c/07756f33ce0a6a150e7dd994dbba2975.jpg" alt="image"><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Process involvement</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In companies where dozens of people work, not everyone understands why and for whom the current work is being done. So it was with Playkey - some of the employees from the product teams saw the general outline of the project and clearly knew what the task was and what it was being done for. The developers wrote their own piece of code and considered the work done. The overall quality of the product suffered, as the developers simply had no idea what the end user would work with.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2h/wq/cw/2hwqcwfpfzzwq_w1ptan1nxd_bk.jpeg"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The situation was corrected by the introduction of weekly team meetings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They began to gather in order to discuss not only the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork, but the entire project as a whole. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now introduced "pizza rallies", which take place every two weeks, on Fridays. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone eats deliciously and at the same time finds out what has been done in two weeks, how a new function or application works, how innovations have affected business performance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each in the end imagines what his site of work is for and what it can influence or has already influenced. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And yes, pizza has greatly increased attendance!</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(non) Employee control</font></font></h3> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As such, there is no control. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only time calculation for solving problems is used, but the goal is not accounting for working time, but an estimate of the timing of the solution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The real term is compared with the planned one, the reasons for the differences are sorted out, and further planning becomes more accurate. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cg/md/fu/cgmdfu7994po-zble5-abpurcga.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And at what time and where (from an office or a banana plantation in Uruguay) work is carried out - generally in a secondary way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While business tasks are being resolved and the interaction between teams and employees is effective, some additional control is not required. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The success of the company is due to the combination of skills, knowledge and relationships of employees, and not their time or geographical location. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All freedom and goodness!</font></font></div>
