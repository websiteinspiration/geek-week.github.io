<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I'm not one of those engineers who, as a child, repaired an old grandmother’s TV with a soldering iron. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dad did not buy me a computer, because I didn’t have a dad. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I grew up in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, lived quite average, studied at a bad school, was a nerd in elementary grades, and didn’t hang out with anyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mom worked, tried to make money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, I basically lived with my grandmother.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They never pressed me with my studies. They said, unlearn and go to work, no matter who, the main thing is not to sit idle. I didn’t sit - I chopped into games, it’s really wild, I even had to do eye surgery. He began to hang out in smoke-filled clubs, and he raised his approval of the guys by playing well in the cook. Then he began to degrade in the area. There has never been a single developer among friends - but I rather like it in them. No one club of interest, even a rapper, no one wanted to become - just ordinary guys.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Nobody even thought of going abroad; everyone just wanted to go to Sharaga or Lyceum after the 9th. Grades 10 and 11 were canceled at that time. Yes, even if you study well, nothing will change. In my environment as a whole there was such an atmosphere. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In Uzbekistan, the concept of “tanish-bilish” is still alive - this is when your neighbor’s uncle puts you in a university or a fatter job. I didn’t have that. After school, I generally let go of the situation and went to a regular college, where I did not have to take exams or pay someone for admission. So I thought, I’ll finish and go as a manager or operator to a bank or a sales agent, like everyone else.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But I liked the math, and I wanted to go to Moscow State University - its branch remained in Tashkent. There they demanded more computer science, I decided to pull it myself without tutors. I found Kernigan and Ritchie’s book on C, and I wildly liked it - as if some kind of magic. Then he further strengthened it with all sorts of stories of cool developers and got completely hooked. For weeks I sat poking around in the terminal. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, they took me to Moscow State University.</font></font><br>
<br>
<hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Fuck is clear, this is not a good fairy tale - they took me only for a contract, so I needed money. I couldn’t get a job as a developer, I didn’t think about a remote site without experience, and I worked as a waiter for a whole year. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the university, during the couples we were not allowed to use the phones. For a big change, I was hungry for food, but if I ordered food at the beginning, they would not have time to bring it, and you wouldn’t normally eat. Everyone ordered quietly under the desks or under the pretext of going to the toilet. It looked pretty funny.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The sites then worked simply disgusting because of the mobile Internet and the wry-handed layout designers. Some institutions could order food in a chat room with a living person. I thought it was strange and inconvenient, plus couriers communicated through telegrams in the Uzbek language - the state language, and I always had a Russian-speaking environment, so I don’t really know the language. Of course, I can buy non (bread) or understand that I was sent to hell. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Once I read about bots on “Zuckerberg will call”, there were all sorts of cases about taxis, and I just needed a pet project for the portfolio. I made a prototype of a bot for ordering food, I suggested to the familiar dryers. They agreed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And after their orders went snowballing, and then almost every major food service outlet began to order bots from me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here something began to creak in my head. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This whole topic helped me pay for my studies and realize that it’s true that you can earn money on programming, and it will be fun — and with your own, albeit lousy, product.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the money from the development seems to be different than from working as a waiter or a sales agent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They feel as if you deceived someone, and no one understood.</font></font></h2> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The institution was not much different from the institution, and it took ten minutes to launch a new bot. I was even called a speaker at a marketing conference. It was generally funny - there were dudes from Yandex, Mail. And I. I just went out and got into it, because in essence there was nothing to tell. In general, I stopped thinking about grades at the university, and forgot to try for the sake of an honors scholarship. Why, if only two bots brought me the same amount. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was a very strange feeling - your shitty code is the product, real people use it, you even helped them in something - it made it better, more convenient than it was. They do not care who you are, and what’s under your hood - FP, not FP, types are not types. They want to eat.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I abandoned my studies and did not really learn how to develop how to be a good businessman either. I always had a fad that I didn’t really go out in any way, that nobody would love and appreciate me just like that. But at the same time, I always want more, I am always dissatisfied with myself. You will conditionally achieve something and right at that moment you think - well, this is nonsense, here are other guys, here they really have a good feeling. Here they can, and you are an imposter. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I was always afraid that the idea of ​​Next Big thing would come to me, but I just did not have enough brains and hands to implement it. And what could be worse. I would gobble up myself. Using the example of bots, I understood that to launch a profit center, a lot is not necessary, and products can be crap. But the fad is still here. And it burned me out.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I decided to sell everything to hell and return to school. I sold it, and well, I graduated from the university, but I still have the complex that I am a trader, not an engineer. They didn’t take me to work in normal positions, where I really wanted to. At the same time, they called to Beeline and other large offices as a manager. And this bombed me, I wanted to prove to myself that I am a developer.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Every year from Uzbekistan only two or three people get to Yandex. For us, this is almost the same as Google. We are all in slow mo. There is little money, few vacancies, the party is about two or three people from the swamp, who have products on the VP or Tilda, a SFTP deployment and the approach “will do.” I decided that if I get there, this will be a confirmation. I began to prepare, went through four interviews, and they took me. There I worked on video and audio calls in the Yandex messenger. I had a very cool lead - he essentially made me a man.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is a lot of work in Moscow, there is a party, a movement, and it seems that everything is easy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The scale of the city, the pace, is not comparable with Tashkent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here I could continue to work in Yandex, I had already scheduled interviews in Avito and Lamoda. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Could grow fast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I would like to stay, but for personal reasons I had to return to my homeland in Tashkent.</font></font><br>
<br>
<hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The missed opportunities hurt. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I sent an application to PaulCamper - it's something like Airbnb for motor homes, a large German startup. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yandex helped me pass the checks, because before that I couldn’t even go through a screening resume. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was cool there - both the team and the culture, even paid business trips to Berlin twice a year. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have an average salary of $ 200-300, and with the money from there I could live like a king.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But I don’t understand why I can’t. Programming at the beginning gives you the feeling that you can do anything. After Moscow and Yandex, I seem to have gained confidence that even a mediocre software engineer from Uzbekistan will always easily find a new job with a decent salary. You look at people who are sitting in a bank or state office, all the important ones, in ties and day after day, are doing the same thing, paper by paper. And from the side - complete hopelessness, the first candidates to replace the neural network. And at this moment you think - well, I snickered. I have a great profession, and they pay more than the market. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the alarm does not go away. Because you understand - you are not very different from them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sprint after sprint, rally after rally, duty on duty. This is an endless work of Sisyphus, there is never a feeling that the work has ended or may even end. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No matter how much I work, nor in Yandex, anywhere else, I can’t get the feeling that I’m doing an important thing. Yes, they pay me well, but comfortable and all that. But everything is crushed to dust on sprint boards and strange boring crap like the endless specifics of German car insurance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Difficult, very difficult to find meanings here. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then there was a cove, there were contractions, bam-boom, the second wave, and it washed me away.</font></font><br>
<br>
<hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Left without development, I felt like a drug addict. And it kills her to do, and it’s impossible to get off. It creeps into you so deep that it suppresses other interests. You speak only for development, you read only about development, you stuff everything and you fill yourself a price tag. And when you're not talking about development, you feel guilty. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I don’t know, I like the stand-up, I even performed in Moscow. I like the video production. But development leaves no chance. It’s like that - well, you’re enough to be ridiculous, then you get paid for features, go read about microservices, in general. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I kind of promise myself to quit and start something else. And then I go, read, study, again respond to the vacancy, go through the social security, accept the offer and climb back into the wheel.</font></font><br>
