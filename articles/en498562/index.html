      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/company/solarsecurity/blog/498562/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Udalenka is a forced trend of this spring. By the end of March, when universal self-isolation began, in our regional centers for monitoring and responding to Solar JSOC cyber attacks, traditional internships were in full swing. We were sure that we were ready for everything, but ... </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/ou/l1/iloul11yhwrvsdo16ejhfv38pzi.jpeg"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- He presses too hard, this is not according to plan. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- Plans are changing. </font></font></i><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Carroll Shelby, Ford vs. Ferrari</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What does Shelby have to do with it, you ask? The famous race car driver and designer Carroll Shelby was always ready to take a gamble and could come up with a non-trivial solution in a difficult situation. We have much more in common than it seems. Because of the situation around COVID-19, plans have really changed. We had to do a tremendous job of rebuilding the infrastructure so as not only to provide remote access for employees, but also not to lose potentially interesting interns in the conditions of training in the style of HomeOffice. How we managed this, and what interns themselves think about working from home, read below.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Usually, our internship course begins with a theoretical block, where children are told about the latest trends in information security, ART, Threat Intelligence and basic monitoring skills. After that, they consolidate the acquired knowledge into practice - they connect to the SIEM system and participate in the investigation of incidents. At the end, the trainees perform several test tasks with generated attacks. We invite the best to work with us. When it became clear that it was impossible to hold face-to-face meetings, we began to transfer interns to a remote format. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There was no discussion about canceling or postponing internships. Training should continue, no matter what! I won‚Äôt go into details of the work done to switch to the remote format, I‚Äôll just show some statistics on the number of remote connections in March:</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9f/72/mp/9f72mpylt647xd_1f2xgxo9_5z0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<blockquote><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes any words ... they ... are useless. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the tools are useful, because they can fix something. </font></font></i><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Carroll Shelby, Ford vs. Ferrari</font></font></b></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For conducting online classes, we chose two sites - Zoom and Skype. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A fairly simple and effective solution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if everything was clear with the theoretical course (here, in fact, we did not lose anything), then with practical exercises a rather fascinating trip awaited us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Starting from the provision of remote access to the test bench (thanks to the IT team, which responded with lightning speed and ensured almost catastrophic access to the servers due to the rapid change of hardware) and ending with a significant expansion of licenses for remote access.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not without such important banalities as transferring credits for VPN trainees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Someone might have reacted to this either rather negligently and simply - for example, sending a password-protected archive with credits, and informing the password with a personal video call. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But for the best students (and we are looking for just such) it was too easy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, in order to get the password, the guys had to solve the problem. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We sent all credits to VPN to all interns. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each such archive was password-protected, and a certain number was written in the letter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The logic is this:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">we take this number and add to it the sum of the numbers of the personal phone number that the interns indicated in the first lesson,</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">add the sum of the numbers of a personal phone number to the received amount,</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">before the resulting combination of numbers, write S0l @ r.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, the task is simple, but fascinating :) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But it is one thing to set up the system, another thing for people, because not everyone is ready to work in a remote format. It would seem that there are many advantages in the distance: you don‚Äôt need to go in crowded vehicles or stand in traffic jams, you can start a working or school day right out of bed and save a lot of money on coffee and rolls on the way to the office. But, you must admit, it‚Äôs difficult to concentrate when during a videoconferencing in the background a relative appears in the ‚Äúhome‚Äù or a favorite cat breaks into the frame, and household affairs are constantly distracting from work. And our coaches are used to getting real feedback when interacting with the guys in the audience: to feel their mood, to see inspired (or, misunderstood) looks. In a word, we stood still ...</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then rolled up their sleeves and rushed into battle! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The participants in this adventure, trainees and mentors, tell how everything turned out and what has changed.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What format do internships usually take?</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentor Artemy Saransky, engineer of the second monitoring line of Solar JSOC in Samara</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : ‚ÄúThe theoretical course is usually divided into three blocks: networks, operating system and security. In practical classes, we show the work of monitoring engineers using the SIEM platform. Then the trainees conduct independent investigations of the generated test incidents. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mh/ph/oh/mhphohhltxjrjggog2dh75vl2-q.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at home, you can create your own atmosphere. </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentor Artyom Shurkhovetsky, Technical Director of Solar JSOC in Rostov-on-Don</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : ‚ÄúWe provide a base in all areas from monitoring to forensics, but more emphasis is placed on monitoring. For practice in the SIEM system, we take real events from which we remove sensitive data and give them to the guys for analysis. ‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How did you get an internship?</font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trainee Igor Maslov, a graduate of the Don State Technical University</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : ‚ÄúIn winter I graduated from the university with a degree in computer security, and representatives of Rostelecom Solar came to defend my diploma and invited me for an internship. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The classes began in February, we already went through the whole theory and are now doing it directly in ArcSight: we connect to the remote desktop, watch incidents and analyze them. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did you switch to the remote format?</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentor Artemy</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Saransky: ‚ÄúThe transition to the distance learning program had almost no effect, because the guys and I managed to complete the theory and already started to practice. I am glad that I even managed to show them the SIEM platform, and they can work with it. And in March, the interns were just supposed to switch to independent test investigations. The only problem was issuing remote accounts, but we quickly dealt with it. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentor Artyom Shurkhovetsky</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : ‚ÄúWhen we announced the transition to a remote format, we already started practical exercises. And this means that it was necessary to organize the interns' access to the test bench, and quickly, literally in a couple of days. I prepared VPN logins and passwords for everyone, and the guys had to figure out a way to transfer this data as safely as possible.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were also team tasks in terms of the internship - we managed to do one of them in the full-time format, but how to organize it remotely until we came up with. Therefore, we changed the program a bit and at online conferences we began to ask the guys more questions in order to get feedback from them. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trainee Vladimir Kondratyev, 5th year student of Samara National Research University named after S.P. Koroleva</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúWhen we were told that everything would continue in a remote format, I was very surprised. Many companies that have now been forced to move to a remote location, first think about how to organize work for employees, and internships fade into the background. But at Solara, everything was well organized. This is not the first time I have been taking a full-distance internship: in the ninth grade I had a similar experience, so I was even a little nostalgic. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We started an internship in December: we went through the whole theory and managed to conduct two practical classes. Then we were given VPN accounts that you can use to connect to the ArcSight booth. Now we need to complete three practical tasks and send a report to the mentor. In general, we are doing the same thing as in the office, only from our laptops. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intern Igor Maslov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúWhen we were transferred to the remote format, I took it for granted, because it‚Äôs better to stay out at home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We were given accounts, but we had to come up with a safe transfer of login and password. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Offered various options - from cryptography protocols like Diffie-Hellman to ordinary Telegram. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, we settled on the archive with a password, which each intern had to pick up on their own. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems that during the quarantine we got new trainees</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the peculiarity of this format, and what difficulties are there?</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentor Artemy Saransky</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : ‚ÄúNow I, as before, give assignments, and the guys answer me in any available form. Some write at two in the morning. Moreover, many interns are still students, and universities also have a lot of work, but they all try very hard. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I myself am for personal communication, because it is better to see who is more interested, who have eyes burning and have a desire to learn something new. Although even in a remote format, a person who has a fuse will not be shy to ask. It helped me a lot that we had known the trainees for more than a month (the classes started in December), but the final grades will probably be harder this time. I hope the video interviews help. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentor Artyom Shurkhovetsky</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúNow the problem is that not all trainees have the opportunity to access the Internet in good quality. Sometimes Zoom falls off, sometimes a VPN ... But still, those guys who are drawn to knowledge have not lost their grip. Of course, when you sit in the audience and see the eyes of each intern, it becomes clear whether he understands or not. It‚Äôs a pity that those guys who don‚Äôt understand something and are embarrassed to ask, in a remote format, probably get even more pinched and move away from me as a lecturer. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trainee Vladimir Kondratyev</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúThe most difficult thing is to organize yourself. Unlike the office, the house is very soothing. At the same time, the remote format requires more time, because you cannot promptly ask a question to the mentor and get a prompt answer - you have to find some information yourself. There are still difficulties with the tasks that we receive: you do not always quickly get to the bottom of the matter. Remotely this takes more time than if you came to a lesson where you can consult with colleagues - the collective mind is still stronger. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ag/lg/h9/aglgh9ry19go56k-5t7zydqbufk.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Zoom, the main thing is to choose the right background </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trainee Igor Maslov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúFrom the first days it became clear that there wasn‚Äôt that working environment at home, and we had to force ourselves to sit comfortably and prepare a workplace. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can, of course, take a laptop to bed, but then the information will be perceived in a completely different way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then you need to ask that you not be distracted, otherwise people think that if you are sitting at home, you can tell something or ask you to do something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first, they distracted me at home, but over time it became clear to everyone that we were engaged, and not just chatting on Skype. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can I refuse full-time internships?</font></font></h3><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentor Artemy Saransky</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : ‚ÄúDefinitely not. The remote format, of course, can be, especially if there are no other options. But even when conducting remote internships, you need to understand that you not only give knowledge online, like Wikipedia, but you also have to do something good in people's heads as a mentor. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentor Artyom Shurkhovetsky</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúIf the purpose of the internship is simply to provide knowledge, then the material can be read remotely. If the task is to select the best, then, of course, you need to somehow implement team tasks, which is difficult to do remotely. In any case, this internship will not pass without a trace, we will get a unique experience, and this is always good. I want to wish the guys not to treat the internship as a lecture at the university. A mentor is not a professor, but a person who primarily shares his experience, and not knowledge from the Internet. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intern Igor Maslov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúIn my opinion, it‚Äôs possible to completely switch to the remote format, but it will still be difficult. At home, you no longer want to do something than you want - it‚Äôs cozy, warm and relaxed. Although a lot depends on the person - if he wants, he can read various manuals and study at home. Remote work has its advantages - you spend more time at home with family and friends. Therefore, I think the quarantine will end soon, and everything will be fine. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tr/gg/yp/trggypc3utjofmyxah7orh7uwpg.jpeg"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even at home you can be on top - the main thing is not to go too high in front of a webcam </font></font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trainee Vladimir Kondratyev</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: ‚ÄúIt is probably possible to completely switch to a remote internship format - this is more related to the technical side of the issue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If companies are ready to develop training manuals and allocate employees, then everything will be organized without problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But still, it‚Äôs better when you can come and talk directly with your mentor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And although I have no particular problems with the remote, when I went to the office, it was somehow calmer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The atmosphere of the JSOC office, in which we managed to spend several months, was remembered by everyone and really want to return there. I hope that after the internship we will have work, but without quarantine. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<blockquote><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only those who are willing to fight can win. </font></font></i><br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Peter Stolypin</font></font></b></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Indeed, now every business is struggling with the situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we do not give up and do not stop, just as our interns do not stop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want to believe that we will soon see each other not in the webcam window, but in real life. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All health and endurance!</font></font></div>
