<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note: Interview prepared with Bigvill. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The author of the text is Sasha Ponomarev.</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Grade 7 coding and work from home</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I‚Äôve been developing since school, from the seventh grade - then a friend and I created a group of sites with free download content. We wrote them in standard PHP, HTML and CSS. We studied in books and in a computer science circle, and also asked advice from adult programmers with whom they corresponded over ICQ. In part, all of this was pushed by my brother, who was studying as a computer science teacher. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I entered PSUTI and from the first year I started freelancing. And for the full day I entered the third year, when I got into one small Samara company. I worked there for several years, the company closed the front-end department due to a change in the company's strategy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After that, I posted the resume on the Headhunter: having by that time serious experience, I could choose from a variety of offers - and chose SimbirSoft. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was offered employment from home - and this became a decisive factor: if earlier I went to the office by 8 in the morning and stood in traffic jams, now I could not leave my apartment at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was also pleased with the completely white salary without delay and major international projects. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The interview took place on Skype. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was asked a few technical questions and sent a code in which I had to find the shortcomings and offer options for resolving them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was on Friday, and already on Monday they informed me that I was suitable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Documents were sent to me, I filled them out and started working.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mentoring system and chat support</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For beginners, we have a streamlined process: be sure to conduct a velcom training (it explains how the company works and who does it), assign it to a mentor specialist, issue a velcombook with a detailed description of what needs to be done, in the form of a checklist. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
About mentoring: a high-level specialist who accompanies you during the trial period is assigned to you: you can contact him with any request, and he will help. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The mentor's tasks include monitoring and developing a newcomer to the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even me, a person with great experience, sometimes had to write to him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus, there‚Äôs a developer‚Äôs chat where more than a hundred people are sitting: ask any question and three will call you and five will write.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Free schedule and career growth</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When I got a job in the company, the branch in Samara was just developing, there were about 15 of us, and the office was absent at that time. It was fun to work from home: you wake up, have breakfast - and immediately get involved in the process, without wasting time on fees and getting to the office. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes it was so interesting for me to code that I didn‚Äôt go out for several days at all. There are also minuses: six months later, I started going to the food court to just look at people, because in the apartment you run wild, especially if you live alone.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, I consider a hybrid ideal for myself: you work at home before lunch, and then go to the office. I must say that with us it is very well located in the center - convenient to get from anywhere in the city. In terms of schedule there are no restrictions: if I want, I can work for several days only from home, or sit in the office from morning to evening.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now I am in the position of head of department in Samara and team leader. As a leader, I am responsible for the development of the frontend department in Samara. I have subordinates from both Samara and Astrakhan, Kazan, Ulyanovsk. Interaction between cities in SimbirSoft is the norm, we constantly solve issues on Skype and work with customers from afar. My main task in the role of team lead is to ensure that project releases come out on time, are made efficiently and without bugs. I began to write code less, but have not completely left it yet.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As I already said, at first there was no office in Samara, the idea arose to meet live, and I began to organize offline meetings with colleagues. The branch was growing, and when the company had a need to open an office, I was offered to deal with this difficult task. I was looking for premises, contractors for the necessary work, and on December 18, 2018, SimbirSoft opened an office in Samara. We also organized HotFrontend </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mitaps</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . I actively attended various conferences in the Volga region as a listener and gained experience, after which I myself was a speaker at HotFrontend. As a result, I was offered to manage the Frontend department in Samara.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I own the frontend to the fullest, and of all the various tasks in this area, I pay most attention to what impressions the user will receive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And besides, it is trendy - Frontend is only gaining momentum. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each year, new development frameworks are released, the industry has only consolidated Angular, Vue.JS, React and Node.js. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">as basic, but they are rapidly changing and supplementing, which is reflected in the development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We at SimbirSoft also keep up to date and introduce modern solutions for our customers.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ideas and parties</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the team, we really have fun. Before isolation, we had parties at the office on Fridays, and now we work remotely and communicate online: bars, meetings, exercises, online championships for various games. We organize various master classes even for the children of employees while their parents are engaged in development. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Developers from all branches usually come together for summer and winter corporate parties, we also hold parties by departments. We also have an internal social network - there we write and find out the latest news, watch broadcasts from corporate events or, for example, have fun and pass funny tests for compatibility with colleagues. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the same time, we can not only have fun, but also learn new things. For employees, they organize English classes, conferences, internal and external meetings.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If one of our guys wants to increase his salary, he can talk with his supervisor and discuss what needs to be studied and in what time frames (for example, to improve his knowledge of TypeScript).</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What Frontend does at SimbirSoft </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
