<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
It all started a couple of years ago, during the period of active growth of Hubber Online - a platform for the interaction of online stores and suppliers of goods in Ukraine. We built a successful platform that Leroy Merlin Vostok became interested in. They wanted a similar platform for themselves, and as a result of our acquaintance, we created a new IT product that allows you to deploy the marketplace individually for the client, taking into account the peculiarities of business processes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With this retailer, we went the way of the samurai - we built most of the marketplace system. We selected 30 people from the current team, which now made up the main staff of Scallium. The product cost several hundred thousand dollars, plus a support budget.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After that, we decided to create a new technological platform that would solve several problems at once.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Close the needs of our existing platform for suppliers and online stores who want to become marketplace;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Create a designer of marketplaces that can be maximally customized for clients without adding them;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Solve the problem of modularity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We did not want to make a micro-service architecture, but sought a balance between SOA and business value, while trying to take into account previous experience.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Solve the problem of extreme stability and high load </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, we got a certain balance between Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and micro-services, the landscape of which consists of dozens of subproducts and systems, each of which also consists of a whole group of services. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/14/mb/e4/14mbe49sxictjltm3o8-crwrfx4.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We rewrote the system from scratch. I will not dwell on what is better - gradually get rid of everything old or dramatically rewrite everything anew. We stopped at a gradual cutting.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It‚Äôs important that the needs of the new platform were different from what we did for Leroy Merlin. They were wider and solved the problem of maximum applicability for other types of marketplaces and businesses from online trading. First of all, there are new requirements in terms of load resistance, the number of transactions and the architectural runway proceeding from this condition. Previously, it was enough to contain tens of millions of SKUs, now the bill went to billions. Plus, the new platform must withstand hundreds of thousands of orders.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
PIM (Product information management) is part of the marketplace system, which can be an independent product. We are even now considering whether to sell it separately, since it is suitable not only for the marketplace, but also for online sellers, suppliers, distributors and offline businesses. PIM contains a content manager‚Äôs office, a system of validation, establishment and storage of goods and quick access (caching).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At that moment, we decided not to reinvent the wheel, but to purchase PIM from Akeneo, as this is one of the most popular open-source PIM systems. Immediately discovered that Akeneo focuses only on cold data storage: roughly speaking, it wrote well, but read slowly. With large amounts of data, the system‚Äôs response speed to a query could sometimes be measured in seconds. Akeneo has excellent functionality, but the slow speed did not suit us. Therefore, we made a binding around their PIM, created about 20 additional services whose task was to cache and speed up the data. It looked like this (3rd level architecture):</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/jy/lb/qdjylbvlwq6ru8lpiidd7xaxxzw.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Akeneo is highlighted here, and everything else is the services we wrote to speed up PIM. The whole architecture will not fit into one picture, but for understanding the approximate part of the scheme, so that you can parse the names of the blocks: </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/xv/3l/lexv3lvxzafq42ufl7qsw94gq6a.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A tremendous work was done, as a result of which we almost became Akeneo integrator partners ... And suddenly we realized that for our business (a platform from 6 blocks, as in the first picture) PIM is the heart. And, it turns out, we give this heart to another (albeit key) partner, on whom we will greatly depend. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After this realization, it became clear that you need to write your PIM. And we wrote no worse in terms of architecture. From the point of view of features, of course, it was necessary to work a lot. We put together a team of 65 people, and gradually began to catch up with the functionality.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now we understand that a well-thought-out architecture gives a win already in the late stages of development. It helped us a lot to accelerate after a year of work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Returning to the functionality, I emphasize that our goal is to maximize the performance of the marketplace: a large number of products, convenient and quick delivery of goods by a team of content managers, the ability to do this with specific merchants subject to validation by content managers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, we made master data and a smart catalog in our PIM. And, if the first one was already in a certain form at Akeneo, then the smart catalog appeared after we made our own.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How it works: when the merchant enters ‚ÄúiPhone 10‚Äù, the system tells him: ‚ÄúDo you mean the iPhone X?‚Äù The merchant clicks ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, and the system tightens all the characteristics of the model. Using master data, it‚Äôs convenient to work with analytics - for example, compare prices and tell the merchant: ‚ÄúYour price for IPhone X is too high.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Or another example. When the merchant enters ‚ÄúIPhone 33 GB‚Äù, the system will say: ‚ÄúSorry, but there is no such model. Choose: 32 GB / 64 GB or create a new product. ‚Äù Such tips help to significantly speed up the process.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
More advanced offers are also important. After all, everyone understands that the marketplace on the window does not display the goods, but the offer - the offer of a particular merchant. Or even a bunch of goods, a card with all the offers. You can choose from all the offers you need. We did not stop there, but added a channel option and a special channel converter to the offers: a web showcase, a mobile showcase, a cross-border (if the product is sold through Shopify or others) - different channels require different content formats, sometimes different directory structures and etc. Accordingly, this content should be able to be displayed differently in each channel.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Converters to the channel is an important thing, because usually the marketplace has several: there are partners, there are different storefronts, and each one works with additional distributors, bloggers and affiliate sales. The world is changing every day, and tomorrow you will need access to thousands of partners' windows. This is done fairly quickly using transformation channels using the same data.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We also worked on mapping the directory tree. Imagine that you have a Brown razor in the category of electric shavers, and Electric shavers are in power tools. Now imagine that your merchant, who pours in his goods, has completely different categories. He has a Brown razor in a tree under the Brown brand. And, in addition to the merchant, there are also showcases of partners who have a third classification. The problem is solved by the master catalog with a plentiful set of data (characteristics, etc.). Mapping to this directory is the ratio of your universal catalog to other catalogs. It needs to be configured once, and then everything works automatically.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is, we have greatly advanced the system in terms of business processes specifically for the marketplace. In fact, we have obtained PIM + DAM (Digital Asset Management) + MDM (Master Data Management) + TCM (Transformations and Channels Management) systems, which go together. And it's more complicated than most modern PIMs do. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I repeat, Akeneo also has some of the voiced chips in one form or another, and they are pretty well implemented. However, we had to sharpen the system for the business processes of the marketplace, and make this system work faster and more stable due to a group of additional services and modern architecture.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The refusal to use Akeneo gave an impetus to the project in terms of creating a model for working with integrators and partners in the future. Suppose an integrator installed our product and customized it, and we can update the platform without affecting those improvements that were during the integration. An integration model similar to Jira was chosen here. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, all 6 modules from the first scheme are now our own development. There are other components that we always take from the outside. For example, CRM, BI (data analysis system) - there are excellent products on the market, and there is no point in competing with them. Also, we are not going to fight in the window-dressing market. But these 6 modules, the core of the marketplace (back office), we do ourselves.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For the marketplace, the main thing is flexibility. One of our customers, an electronics store, suddenly started selling bicycles. Was he special in bicycles? No. But he quickly and cheaply tested this new category. I just added a new product to my storefront and saw that people are ready to buy bicycles from Poland, wait 3 weeks to wait for the goods, and at the same time make an advance payment.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is one of the principles of Agile. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I always say that marketplace is an Agile way of doing business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Testing a hypothesis with the quick launch of a proposal on the market is very important these days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This means that the marketplace should as quickly as possible create a new category of products, in which it does not necessarily understand, look at demand and further expand this category or deselect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a business with the right platform, these experiments are cheaper, and they give the marketplace a competitive market advantage - speed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when speed matters, you cannot rely on expertise. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only for experiments!</font></font></div>
