<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why moved</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before moving, I held the position of Lead Business Analyst in the EPAM office in Kiev. In life and work in Ukraine, absolutely everything suited me - a competitive level of compensation, interesting projects, comfortable life. Of course, a person always wants more, but I was completely satisfied with my position.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Like many IT professionals, thoughts about relocation visited me from time to time, but things didn‚Äôt move beyond any ideas - project employment was quite high, and there were enough opportunities for career development. But a lot has changed since my trip to the United States last summer when I went to my colleagues from the EPAM Boston office to work with our client. And at some point, American colleagues invited me for an interview. After a series of interviews, I received an offer and an offer to move to the States. Migration between offices from different countries is absolutely normal for EPAM.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After some thought, I accepted the offer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main motive in making the decision to move for me was curiosity and a desire to leave the comfort zone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was interesting to find out what it was like to start life in a new country, whether my expertise was worth anything on a larger scale. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, relocation turned out to be such a personal challenge and a test of strength. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I was absolutely not preparing to move in advance, which means I did not have any accumulations and did not feel the ground.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who am I working with now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New old specialization</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I currently hold the position of Business Consulting Manager in the Life Science &amp; HealthCare department. If you compare this role with my position in Ukraine, then there is not much in common. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Business analytics and business consulting in the EPAM structure are two fundamentally different directions, although the core of my specialization - business analysis - remains unchanged. Consulting is an important area for the company, which EPAM has been actively developing over the past years. Consulting is a more comprehensive and broader vector than business analysis, and it is logical that a new position implies a larger pool of managerial qualities. As a business analyst, I was focused on the delivery of the project. Now I am more focused on studying the entire business of the client, searching for solutions to further improve the work of the company as a whole.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, to some extent, a change of country of residence meant professional growth for me.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mechanics of the process and bureaucratic procedures</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
About six months passed from the first interview to the offer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They gave me four weeks to prepare and collect all the necessary documents. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to colleagues from the Minsk office - they are the ones who deal with issues of relocation within the company - and their own accuracy (I keep all the important papers together) I practically did not feel the burden of bureaucracy (well, in addition to the fact that my day turned into a round-trip of events scheduled up to minutes). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fact, I was supported from the beginning of the collection of documents to the meeting in the American office. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think that without this option it would be very difficult for me personally to organize the whole process. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some nuances arose only during the closure of entrepreneurial activity, bank accounts.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">City selection</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During the discussion of all the moments of the move, I was given the opportunity to choose the location in which I will live and work. There were two options: Boston and New Jersey. I chose the location solely from my personal preferences. Therefore, the option with Boston, despite the fact that it is a very beautiful city, and New England itself, a rich region with wonderful infrastructure, disappeared right away - it's too cold for me there. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the end, as you already learned from the beginning of this text, I opted for Jersey City. Which, incidentally, surprised me - at the time of choosing the city, I did not know that it was located on the opposite shore from the adored many of Manhattan (and the EPAM New York office). </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k7/qq/5w/k7qq5w6rv_x00f8dr2n1befx9tw.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actually, such a view opens up on New York</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Jersey is very similar to the new and very cultural sleeping area, which is relatively accessible from the center. So, my apartment is separated from Manhattan by a bay, to get through which by public transport is a matter of thirty minutes. Friends from Brooklyn spend about an hour on the road there (but they can always boast that they live in NY, and not like me - in some suburb there, and even in another state).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to time to travel, life in Jersey provides a number of other advantages: lower rental property costs (and its choice is somewhat more diverse), lower tax rates (which is very important), it is much calmer and quieter here. At the same time, life is in full swing - in the city there are a lot of entertainments, business and cultural objects that are not concentrated in the center, but evenly distributed throughout the territory. Such ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù was very unusual for me, because in Kiev everything is tied to the center - almost all business, cultural and ‚Äúsecular‚Äù activity takes place in certain areas, other parts of the city serve only as a place for housing. Here, life "on the periphery" can often be more interesting and diverse than in the central part. And this contributes to the relatively uniform development of the city.</font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The streets are neat and comfortable.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Of course, even because of the geography of Jersey, someone may not be suitable as an alternative to living in New York. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I highly recommend considering this option. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Summing up, I‚Äôll say that living in the USA it is very important to develop flexibility in mobility and housing issues, as </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a new project or job can make you dramatically move, not just from district to district, but from state to state. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many Americans live in such a rhythm and have long been accustomed to it.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where to start when moving</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The very first thing you need to do to make your life in the United States comfortable is to take care of your bank account and credit score. Without these things in the first couple it will be very, very difficult. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I was lucky, because about a year ago during one of my long business trips I opened an account with Bank of America - to work with this bank you only need a passport of any country. Along with the debit account, I had a credit limit equal to the deposit (at that time this was a couple of hundred dollars). I used the card for small purchases, paying for subscriptions of various services. All this time, some sort of financial history has been kept behind me.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Having a financial history will help you, after receiving a social security number, get a full credit card with an adequate limit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The credit limit and the availability of financial history will be a weighty argument in your favor in a number of situations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, when renting a house, these factors can affect the amount of the collateral: with a good credit score, you will need to put out a conditional $ 500, if it is completely absent, the collateral can grow up to the cost of several months of rent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naturally, the deposit rules are different in each state.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Search and arrangement of housing</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The most difficult thing in finding a home is when you just arrive, you don‚Äôt understand what is good and what is bad. And businessmen dishonest will probably want to take advantage of this. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I strongly recommend not to rush and carefully study the market. In total, I spent more than three weeks searching for housing, reviewing more than fifty different options. Pay special attention to the study of the area and the terms of the contract with the potential lessor. I came across excellent apartments in areas that, as it turned out, looked quite adequate during the day, and when it got dark it could be really dangerous to go out there. They also tried to slip a contract that did not provide for conditions for termination. In general, be vigilant.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The runaway of rental prices is big. It all depends on the particular state, your tastes, wishes and feelings of beauty. The most averaged one-room apartment in New Jersey in a good house and a good area will cost you about $ 2000 / month. The same apartments, but in Manhattan will be dragged from your budget every month from $ 3,000 to $ 8,000. Alternative options: for the same $ 2000 / month you can rent a private house quite far from the city, and for $ 800-1000 - a room in the apartment. Personally, I stayed at an apartment in downtown Jersey City.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My apartment has a number of advantages: a brand new house, excellent amenities (a common floor on which there is a library, a gym, a common lounge area, a pool and a barbecue for $ 60 / month), the apartment itself is located on the 8th floor and costs $ 3000 / month. For example, the same apartment on the 16th floor will cost $ 300-400 more - but the view from there is much more interesting. The house has a very limited number of parking spaces, and they are very expensive. But with the rights granted by the state of New Jersey and the car registered there, you get permission to park the car on the street for a conditional $ 200 / year. </font></font><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Common area in the house</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When searching for housing, I did not use the services of brokers. This is often expensive, there is a risk that you will be ‚Äúscrewed up‚Äù with a bad option, and finding a home yourself is not so difficult. Many houses belong entirely to legal entities that specialize in renting and leasing real estate, that is, the house was originally built for rental, this is their business. I highly recommend working with such legal entities (after having studied reviews about a particular company). In addition, renting directly from such companies often provides a number of small advantages. For example, to make and put into operation a request for repairing anything in the house (and to achieve its fulfillment) is much easier when you rent a house from a company than from a landlord.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, another important point about the arrangement of life. Most apartments provide that you already have your own furniture. Therefore, remember that in addition to rent and collateral (and with a weak credit score it may be the cost of 1.5 months of rental), you need to have at least some money to purchase the necessary household utensils. The amount for the arrangement of the apartment can be either minimal or go to the equivalent of the cost of the car, for example - it all depends on your wishes and tastes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Small life hack: some furniture can often be found simply exposed to the street by previous owners. There is nothing shameful about using used things, many do. In most cases, it is in good condition, you just need to do a chemical treatment before use. Examples of what is useful and not very can be found on the streets are in this </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instagram account</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stoopingnyc Instagram account where you can find various things that are no longer needed by the previous owners</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I don‚Äôt advise much to spend money on missing interior items: the ‚Äúnomadic‚Äù way of life for the USA is the norm to which everyone sooner or later adapts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Good furniture is expensive, just as expensive will have to be paid for its transportation from apartment to apartment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So why should I get overweight and expensive ballast, some of which in the future will also be put on the street in anticipation of new owners?</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finances: salary, taxes and household expenses</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As the taxi driver who drove me from the airport told me: ‚ÄúIn America you are fine if you are either somewhere in poverty or very rich. But if you are a middle class, then hold on. ‚Äù After several months of living here, I do not quite agree with this thesis. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Speaking of taxes, income and expenses, it is important to remember that everything here is very different from state to state. The spread can be quite large, so the numbers will mainly relate to the region where I live. In general, poverty in the US is about $ 40-45 thousand per year before taxes. It‚Äôs really not much, but even in the status of ‚Äúpoor‚Äù many (and even with their families) live quite normally here. Of course, there is no talk of excesses, only payment for housing and modest daily expenses.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The situation with salaries is very similar to the situation with real estate - it is very difficult to understand what is good and what is bad. Thus, the average salary level of middle / senior business analysts has a very large fork. Amounts start from $ 60 to $ 200 thousand per year (of course, before taxes). In the FAANG group (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and other world giants, analysts can offer about $ 300-400 thousand. It is clear that the competition for these vacancies is very high. Also, in addition to salary, sign in bonus is often practiced here. Its amount is individual, varies from company to company. A good level of compensation can be considered $ 100 + thousand per year - this money is enough to support a family of two people. Finding a job ‚Äúfrom the street‚Äù without experience in American companies can be difficult.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For the reason the NDA, I can‚Äôt name the amount of my annual compensation, but I will say that it allows me to maintain a fairly comfortable standard of living, to attribute myself to that very middle class. Although some consumer habits acquired throughout life in Ukraine had to be reviewed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, trips to restaurants / cafes, etc. I cut back. On the other hand, my grocery basket has become much better. The ‚Äúfood‚Äù category costs me about $ 500-600 / month for two, taking into account the purchase of dietary and other specific foods that my health requires. During quarantine, this type of expense increased to $ 1000 - sitting at home there are fewer opportunities to save on food purchases, more often you order food.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I visit the gym regularly, and I pay almost nothing for it - there are a lot of clubs here and most offer the first month of classes at a bargain price. Therefore, I, like many others, wander from club to club every month. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The category ‚Äúclothes‚Äù will also not pull the wallet, if you do not bother about brands. If you want and have the time, you can save on almost everything by looking for discounts, comparing prices and visiting sales. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Still dealing with taxes. The fiscal system in the US is a topic for another discussion. But I already managed to file an annual declaration, and, frankly, filling it out caused fewer questions than filling out the same document for the Ukrainian tax.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The average rate for New Jersey is around 24-25%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The final percentage is affected by a number of factors: income level; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">marital status; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the presence and number of children and other persons financially dependent on you; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">participation in charity initiatives; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">whether you fill out the declaration alone or with a family member. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Impressions of the country and relocation</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have never experienced much trepidation for the United States as a country for work and life. For a number of reasons, you thought the country was very specific, addictive, if you decided to stay here for a long time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After the move, most of these prejudices were dispelled. However, I‚Äôm still getting used to the total commercialization of everything and everything (there‚Äôs nothing bad about it, but some things are unusual; for example, crossing a river can be private property, for the use of which you need to pay its owner), some measured life (but this does not mean that everything is being done here slowly), the peak concentration of people from various countries (you are used to being understandable and polite with everyone, but for this it is important to understand the characteristics of many, many cultures well).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main thing that I felt when I was in the States was the absence of any ceilings and restrictions at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Ukraine, I clearly saw the line of my professional and career development, the future seemed clear and more or less predictable to me, there seemed to be an almost unshakable confidence in my expertise. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here, it seems that I‚Äôm starting my career from scratch - I found many gaps in my knowledge and skills that need to be filled, since I began to see much more prospects and growth options here. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After several months of real, rather than tourist life in the USA, I can say that this is an interesting, difficult and multifaceted country. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, despite all its gloss, it may not be suitable for everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I came up.</font></font></div>
