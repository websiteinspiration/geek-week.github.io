<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I'll tell you a couple of stories. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not pretend to truth in the highest instance, of course.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Change with colleagues</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I‚Äôm talking about real changes, and not about the introduction of techniques, the transition to a new CRM-ku or task manager. The real ones are when people start to work differently, and the result of their activity is radically improved. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Changes quickly squander the ‚Äúbank account‚Äù of relations, moreover, with subordinate, parallel, and higher ones. Here is simple math: if you manage to accumulate a balance of relations, then you spend it until the overdraft, and if you do not have time, then you work on credit. And the loan has a limit. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, one dude wanted to change the work of a team of programmers. He knew exactly what to do, preliminary showed that his plan worked (on a different sample). Well i.e. take the finished case and use it. The exhaust for the team is simple: more results with the same efforts, and more money in your pocket.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The debit balance was enough for two weeks, then work went on credit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Crescent worked on the proposed scheme, received a noticeable improvement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But she strained the need to work according to someone else's scheme, and gradually she outweighed it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the second half of the month we worked already on credit of relations, like an Italian strike - like, we do what you say, but the further you go, the longer you lower your sleeves. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The result: a broken relationship, with a clearly positive result, even in the first month. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, of course, they kicked out the ‚Äútraitor‚Äù and returned to the previous scheme and previous results.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Change with the owner</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The same story with the direct beneficiary, i.e. beneficiary of changes. There was one dude who took up the changes in the office on the instructions of the owner. It started wonderfully - received a full carte blanche and almost unlimited resources. Figachil, how much halva. And very quickly flooded. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, stupidly, profit began to grow, although work was not carried out directly with its components, but with supporting processes. But they, as it turned out, influenced profits so strongly and quickly that their heads were spinning with success. At the owner. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The dude understood that he was doing everything right, and he just needed to not go blunt and continue. And the owner fell into the trap of "well that's it, now he‚Äôll trample on his own." And he began to make his proposals.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the very beginning, he was silent, taking the position "do at least something, I finally do not know what to do." And when I saw, and partly understood the process of change, suddenly, out of nowhere, I remembered what I read in books. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At first, gently, like, just to offer, let's discuss something like this. Well, dude discussed, explained why you shouldn‚Äôt do that. But the farther, the more the owner began to believe that his ideas were worth something, and they also needed to be used. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It got to the point that the dude said: no, you are offering bullshit, the owner. You set me to make changes, so I do. What do you think the owner answered? About "I'll give you *** right now." A minute later, of course, he apologized, but the late guy clicked already.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The dude was stubborn, and continued to bend his line. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just stopped explaining what he was doing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And about a month later he was removed from this job. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then it was fun. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was removed from the management of the entire project of changes, but was not excluded from the team of this project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The leader was put in another person, with directly opposite views on life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our dude came up with what to do and did. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the new leader was only able to do. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They gathered and asked the dude: say what you need to do. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And he told them: you tell me this, and I will do it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or turn back. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, word for word, the duo quit, and the draft changes were covered with a copper basin. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the end: not just folding, but the rollback of changes, the decline in company performance at times, spoiled relationships, loss of faith in change.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Change all the way</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But miracles do happen. When the change implementer works alone and goes all the way. One acquaintance reformed the supply service, it included a warehouse and purchasers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At first, he succumbed to the illusion that everyone around him - friends and like-minded people, would help him in every way, with ideas, facts, and hands. But, fortunately, he quickly realized that one needed to change. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, he spat and said: I‚Äôll do everything myself. The owner, in the sense, said. He shook his head, let‚Äôs say, tell me what you‚Äôll do, specifically, the plan, charter, events, resources, etc. And he rested and that's it: either himself, or nothing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The owner thought for the weekend, and decided: okay, do not care. Well, I gave carte blanche. And did not climb.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, the guy did everything himself. The process reconfigured, automated, changed the motivation system, accompanied, supported, etc. The account of relations with all involved colleagues, including the owner, went into a tough minus. Probably, he did not reach the credit limit of relations with the owner, because the process of changes was managed to be completed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then a miracle happened. Well, firstly, the project itself was implemented successfully. And secondly, those who hated him dramatically changed their attitude - they began to drag them around in their arms. Well, why - the guy saved them from the eternal jambs, for which they were used to raking, and their salary increased, and, in general, they became heroes. Just because the remaining services have problems, but these services have disappeared.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In total, it turns out that if you endure an extremely low level of relations in the process of changes, then at the output this level can grow much higher than the initial one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, if the changes bring good results.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Change with friends</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But this is the most stupid undertaking, because she kills friendship for nothing if one wants, and the second does not. Changes in this sense are like a test, like the campaign proposed by Vysotsky with a friend in the mountains. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If ‚Äúthe gloom was angry but went‚Äù, the level of relations temporarily fell, but the person treats this adequately, understands that it IS NECESSARY. And it goes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And if ‚Äúimmediately turned sour and - down‚Äù, or ‚Äústumbled - and shouted‚Äù, then the balance of relations was initially very low, or they went uphill too steeply. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were two friends guys who were trying to do IT business. Both concluded that changes needed to be made. Not to say that it‚Äôs serious - to expand the product line dramatically, change approaches to customers, and optimize project activities. The essence and purpose of the changes was both understood and accepted by both.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, alas, change is not only the essence and purpose, but also work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Changes must be made, like any other job. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not only dream of hiking in the mountains, but also crawl up, fall, freeze, starve and lack oxygen. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, one of them seemed to endure, and the second was "turned down and down." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, sort of, and don't care - you can just roll back the changes and wait for a more favorable moment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the relationship is already ruined, and the business rested on them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, the business is over. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Total, there is no business, friendship turned into passive hostility and mutual accusations.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The army of "convinced"</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most of the guys who are trying to deal with change, can not stand the fall in the level of relations. They can‚Äôt live in a state where "everyone has begun to feel worse about me." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A decrease in the level of relations overshadows the goal of change, and the benefits that are predicted or even promised - for example, increased income or position. We are social beings. Thanks to the brain default system, which dramatically raises the priority of current relationships over distant goals. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the trick is different. Those who started the changes and abandoned see a contradiction that does not give them rest: I returned the relationship to a good level, and I am now well done, but I threw the change, so I'm not done. We must still decide whether you are well done or not.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They say that at this moment consciousness turns on - it is it that is responsible for eliminating contradictions, because </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">does not want to live with them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here the choice is simple - either admit that you are dependent on relationships, and you are well done only when you are well treated, or the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchange is called evil. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So the army of "convinced" is replenished - those who "realized" that change is nonsense. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this army, it is customary to humor a lot about ‚Äúeffective‚Äù managers, cobblers, nouveau riche, info-gypsy, politicians, sloppies, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- all those who are directly or indirectly related to the topic of change. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, such a "convinced" almost never returns to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãventuring change. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just because he is afraid to again experience the difficulties of losing relationships, and to experience a contradiction.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Change with strangers</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The most practicable option that I have seen is to start changing when the relationship is either not yet formed or is already ruined (including deliberately). Simply put, when there is nothing to lose. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The only thing is that you need to have a credit of trust from some decision maker. And remember that this loan decreases very quickly. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Next, simple mathematics works: changes should bring results faster than the balance in the relationship account decreases. The easiest option is to start with small changes that are noticeable in time. Make a small project that will quickly show the result.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is like an investment with a short return period. You give away the rest of the relationship, you sit "without money", but very quickly return everything back with interest. As a result, both the balance is higher than the initial one, and the overdraft limit is increased - the decision maker already knows what you can and will suffer longer the next time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now you can begin more extensive changes. But to remember that they should bring results in the foreseeable future is still worth it. As well as the rate of decrease in relations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You just need to understand: the essence of the changes is not clear to everyone around. The results are clear. Losses and difficulties in the process are understandable. And what are you doing there, and why exactly this is not clear.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
While there is no result, everyone sees only the difficulties and problems that you create. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Explaining your actions also makes little sense - it can happen, as in the story with the owner. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, in principle, the motivation for your actions can be understood only by those who work directly with you, who understand current and global goals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pain, in short. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Total, the principle is simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We hammer in relations with everyone, including decision-makers, for a short period. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not spend time restoring these relations until the changes have brought results. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We focus on the successful implementation of the changes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The faster the result is obtained, at least intermediate, but understandable by the decision-maker and others, the faster the return on investment with interest. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or at least cashback.</font></font></div>
