<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tips for executives from employees</font></font></h2><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Define goals and objectives and try not to change them every day.</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The well-known management consultant Yitzhak Adizes compares the organization with a chain of interconnected gears, in which the head is a large gear, and his subordinates are smaller gears. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A small movement of a large gear can cause several small revolutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the leader is a person who has “seven Fridays in a week”, then his employees will very quickly get tired of his constant throwing and begin to be guided by the principle of “do not rush to fulfill the order - cancel”, and the organization turns into a viscous swamp. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The leader should have a clear vision of goals and objectives, and, of course, the will to achieve them.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Do not demotivate!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Yesterday I tried the stick and carrot method on my subordinates. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The gingerbread is uncomfortable - it crumbles upon impact. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We must test the whip and whip method. ” </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, sometimes this joke turns into a steady behavioral pattern of a leader. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An employee performs all his tasks and even more, but he is not noticed, good work is taken for granted, and any mistake is considered a critical failure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This model of behavior is very hard on the motivation of a specialist and negatively affects the whole team as a whole. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Employees begin to be guided by the principle "Closer to the kitchen, away from the bosses." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Managers need to learn to see the results of work and successes of employees and to encourage their achievements.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Keep your friends away from business</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It’s good to drink beer with friends and discuss IT industry news, but running a business can be problematic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Friends of the leader at some point may decide that they are outside the established rules. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Envy, a desire to use friendship in their interests and to the detriment of the common cause may appear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The manager must clearly distinguish between personal and working relationships. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Friendship built on business is better than business on friendship.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4.Do not be a rag, fire loafers</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Management is related to conflicts. When the leader tries to be good for everyone, this can lead to the situation when loafers appear in the team, whom he cannot fire. The reason is the threat of tantrums, tears, tales of a difficult life situation, and sometimes blackmail. There are situations when an employee frankly "scores" for work, but when threatened with dismissal, he "remembers" that he, it turns out, has a demanding wife and children at home who need to be fed and must be taken out to the warm sea for a month or two in the summer. Why does the awareness of his personal responsibility not come at those moments when he begins to “knock down” to work at one in the afternoon or include entertaining videos on YouTube during working hours? If the manager admits similar behavior in his team, then the efficiency of other employees begins to decline,as people ask themselves: “But what, it turns out, was it possible?”. You need to be able to part with loafers quickly and without unnecessary sentiment, they must work with our competitors.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3>5.     ,   !</h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the mid-2000s, I participated in a project to develop an inventory management system for an American pharmaceutical company. The project had a poor background: the customer independently described the requirements, and our project manager joyfully agreed to remove the phase of collecting and analyzing requirements from the project. Accordingly, when it came to implementation, unpleasant surprises surfaced: contradictions in requirements, ambiguities, obvious mistakes, and the project deadlines “floated”. The manager made a strong-willed decision: "We will work on Saturdays!" We fulfilled the decision and began working in the office on weekends, but we did not see the manager in those days. Our attitude to the leader sharply worsened, which affected the effectiveness of our work. If the manager wants to encourage employees to process and labor exploits,then he himself must prove himself and not forget about the motivation of his employees.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. Learn to hold meetings</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The higher the employee ascends the career ladder, the more space in his life is occupied by all kinds of meetings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is known that meetings can have different types and take place in different formats. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Meetings may be:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">operational (questions: “Who / what is doing? What are the results / problems? What are the plans?”);</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">systemic (questions: “How to establish this process and remove the mess in it?”);</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">strategic (question: “What are our goals and objectives?”);</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ideological (questions: "Why are we all doing this?"). </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone is also familiar with the meeting formats: </font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">exchange of opinions (each speaks in turn); </font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">report (one delivers a presentation / report);</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">discussion (anyone can take the floor);</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">brainstorming (chaotic generation of ideas with a complete prohibition of criticism). </font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is necessary to prepare for meetings, manage their progress and ensure the implementation of decisions made at them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the leader admits the mixing of the types and formats of meetings, lets everything go by itself, then instead of solving problems, he achieves only their "speaking out". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, resumes of specialists began to come across, in which, among their key skills, participation in meetings was included, perhaps candidates imply that they learned to sleep with their eyes open.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. Understand what you are leading!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the leader took his place, but at the same time did not go the way from the bottom of the career ladder, then there is a risk that not all the processes that he is trying to manage are transparent to him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, he becomes a hostage to his subordinates, who can tell him for years about unsolvable tasks and space terms. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The leader must be able to understand the essence of the problem and, if necessary, dive even to low-level details, for example, look at the implementation of the algorithm in the product that his company creates.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tips for employees from managers</font></font></h2><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Check for yourself!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In relation to the results of their work, on one side of the spectrum you can place specialists who do everything to “get rid of”, and on the other side - perfectionists who can never finish work because of their manic desire for an unattainable ideal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A professional developer should be somewhere in the middle and create a code in which he himself is sure, since he tested the correctness of his work before transferring it to testing specialists. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In severe cases, testing is carried out by customers for their own money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, any employee of the company, before transmitting the results of their work, must independently verify the level of its quality and not rely on someone else to check for it.</font></font><br>

<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Ask Google first!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is an old student joke. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We decided to conduct a survey among students. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
They ask the American: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - How long will you learn Chinese and pass the exam? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 “Well, that’s a very difficult language ... Two years of effort.” </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Englishman is asked the same question: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - If it’s four, then somewhere in a year. And I’ll never give it to the top five. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Asked a student at MSTU. N.E.Bauman, he replies: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Is there a training manual? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - There is. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Now I will finish, I will go to hand over.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now any developer has unlimited access to documentation, to opensource projects, in which the problems that he encountered in his work are most likely resolved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, there are people who, having met the first difficulties, give up without finding a solution in a search engine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A good developer should be able to use Google, formulate thoughts in English and not be afraid to look into someone else's code on GitHub.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Do not spend all the time creating a framework instead of completing tasks </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As an undergraduate, he completed an internship at a company specializing in software development, during which he first heard about the standard problem of programmers that is still relevant. Developers are always interested in new technologies and pure creativity. Instead of trying to solve a specific problem that the customer needs, we begin to create our own framework, with the help of which, we think, then it will be possible to solve any customer problem. As a result, we leave very little project time to solve the problems for which we are paid money, and the quality of the product begins to suffer. You need to be able to solve not all kinds of problems, but solve those problems that are really important for users of our products, and, of course, initially lay the possibility of painless expansion of functionality.If you want to feel like a creator of the framework, then a lot of opensource projects are waiting for us in our free time.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Learn to structure!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The programmer, in my opinion, is a person who sees data structures and algorithms in everything and loves to find solutions to problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, sometimes in our profession there are people for whom it is extremely difficult to structure information, see dependencies, and find solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead of finding a solution, some happily come up with a dozen unsolvable problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A professional must constantly work on himself and study the relevant literature, which will allow him to turn into a structured problem solver.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Do not try to become irreplaceable! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Document!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the internship mentioned above, the head of the training center told us about another standard development path. The project starts and is first led by only one professional developer who does everything himself and keeps everything in his head. Then he has assistant programmers who follow only his instructions. At the same time, due to the lack of documentation, since our pro has no desire to share his sacred knowledge, the assistants do not know how the product works and how it works. It turns out the product of one person. Then the solution is brought to the market, users begin to exploit it and find errors. Only pros can solve problems, and now his work is turning from free creativity into a nightmare. He is bored of this, and he leaves for another project in another company and no longer wants to hear about his brainchild.Happy users are left with an unsupported solution. Only full-fledged documentation of development and the exchange of knowledge in a team can avoid this sad situation. Now companies are actively implementing safe development processes, which also include detailed documentation of the project. By the way, GOST R 56939-2016 “Information security. Secure software development. General requirements ”was developed by experts of our company.Secure software development. General requirements ”was developed by experts of our company.Secure software development. General requirements ”was developed by experts of our company.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. Love your product!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Professionals love their work and are proud of their code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Non-professionals may consider that users will already use their product, for example, due to the lack of available alternatives. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A distinctive feature of such vendor companies is their reluctance to use their developments within the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, if a programmer does not burn with the product that he creates, does not respect his users, then he should think about changing the scope of his efforts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, he will facilitate the life of both himself and the many clients of the employing company.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. Be positive and open to communication.</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many IT professionals are not always sociable, because of which they can and undeservedly suffer. Moving from development to IT consulting, I worked hard to stand out among my colleagues and get a double promotion (jump over a step in the career ladder). Even the first time I passed the professional exams CISA, CISSP, which should have been taken only by specialists with a couple of years of experience more than mine. When the letters of appointment came, I was surprised to find that I was promoted as well as the others - by one step. Then I finally got the courage and asked my leader about the promotion, to which I received a simple answer: "Yes, you work great, but you never said about your goal to get a double promotion." One should not be afraid to communicate with both colleagues and managers,people around you should know what is in your head. Even if the developer is close to genius, but at the same time does not know how to communicate with colleagues or even is “toxic” (negativist), then he will not be of much use, but he will be able to spoil the life of the whole team. Communicative skills in the modern world are very easy to develop and this opportunity cannot be neglected.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8. Understand what you are programming!</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Just as managers need to understand the processes that they control, so programmers must understand the subject area in which they work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is programming inherently? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Creation of algorithms and data structures reflecting the subject area. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you do not understand what you are doing and how your program makes life easier for users, you cannot create a good product.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead of a conclusion</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The topic of the article, of course, is extensive and it is impossible to limit it to a few sore points that we managed to write about. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Famous authors write entire books about this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From what I read, I would like to recommend two: “An ideal leader. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why they can’t become and what follows from it ”by Yitzhak Adizes and“ Ideal programmer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to become a professional in software development »Robert Martin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I’ll also add that right now we are expanding the development department at our Echelon Technologies company (part of the Echelon group of companies), and are actively </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">looking for talented developers of different levels</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> who share our views on life and work.</font></font></div>
