 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Recently I saw an article on Habré </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Distributed gaming network as an alternative to GFN"</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and decided to write about his experience of participation in such a network. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It so happened that I am one of the first participants in the program described in the article. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I'm not a gamer, but just the owner of several productive PCs whose power is used by the network. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To immediately make it clear what I’m talking about, my servers are used by network-connected gamers of the cloud gaming service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The article mentioned above mentions SONM, Playkey, and Drova. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I tried the service from Playkey and now I’ll try to talk about the nuances of the distributed network and work in it.</font></font><br>
 <a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Network principle</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Briefly describe how it all works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A cloud-based gaming service is looking for owners of powerful PCs who are ready to provide the computing resources of their machines for money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When a player connects to a cloud service, he automatically selects the server closest to the user, and the game runs on this particular machine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, the delays are minimal, the gamer plays and rejoices, the cloud service and the server owner receive the money paid by the gamer.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did I get into all this?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My experience in IT is about 25 years. For many years I have been managing a small private enterprise that specializes in developing navigation systems. I love games, but you can hardly call me a passionate gamer. The company has about two dozen powerful machines, the resources of which are far from being fully utilized. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Somehow I began to look for the opportunity to download them for the benefit of the company, that is, to get additional income. I saw several foreign and domestic services that offered to hand over the resources of their PCs for money. Most of the proposals are, of course, mining, which did not attract me from the word at all. Fake in this area at the time was 99%.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But I liked the idea of ​​loading servers with games, the idea turned out to be close in spirit. First I applied for beta testing, it was accepted right away, but now the invitation to participate came in a year and a half. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What attracted me was that only hardware was required of me, and on the same physical server it was possible to run several virtual machines, which I did in the future. Everything else - installation of specialized software, configuration, updates - the service took over. And that was great, because I don't have much free time.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After deploying the system, I tested the game on a distributed network from the player’s side (I connected to my own server, which was several kilometers at the time of the game). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compared just with a game in the cloud. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The difference was very noticeable - in the first case, the process could be compared to playing on your own PC.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Equipment and networks</font></font></h3><br>
 <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0be/42b/d8f/0be42bd8fc7e81bce9b4bb4150c27fe1.jpg" alt="image-2020-04-16-15-15-01-27"> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I tested the work of a distributed network on different equipment. As for the PC, these were workstations based on Intel processors from i3 to i9, with different memory modules in volume and frequency. The computers have HDD and SSD drives with SATA and NVME interfaces. And, of course, Nvidia graphics cards of the GTX 10x0 and RTX 20x0 series. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To participate in the beta testing program, I used 4 servers based on i9-9900 processors with 32/64 GB RAM, each with 3 virtual machines. A total of 12 relatively powerful virtual machines that meet the criteria of the program. I placed this equipment on a shelf a meter wide. The housings were well-blown, with powerful cooling systems and dust filters.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bo/bs/k0/bobsk05zvcpiqoscjj5iz-tlmfe.jpeg"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Network equipment also used different things, bandwidth ranged from 100 Mbit / s to 10 Gbit / s. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As it turned out, most home routers with a bandwidth of up to 100 Mbps are not suitable for a distributed network. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actually, even normal network work with such devices is a problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But gigabit routers with 2 or 4 core processors fit perfectly. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a7/778/29f/6a777829f87b7f2424bd0f45ad8c2285.jpg" alt="image-2020-04-16-15-09-09-58"><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is what the server looks like on three virtual machines</font></font></i><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Server load</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I became a member of the distributed network program before the pandemic. Then the computers were loaded at about 25-40%. But after, when more and more people switched to isolation, the load began to grow. Now loading of some virtual machines reaches 80% per day. I had to postpone the test and maintenance work in the morning, so as not to create inconvenience to the players. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/op/mv/gpopmvauivzq5tusswsuufweqge.png"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the popularity of the service, the load on me and my colleagues has also increased - you need to monitor the work of virtual and physical machines. Sometimes there are failures that need to be fixed. However, so far we are managing, everything is going well.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/1c/ma/df1cmavfbsnmwrxryylbluzdrx4.png"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I see the loading of my virtual machines in the admin panel. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It shows which cars and how busy they are, the amount of time the player spent, which game started up, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are a lot of details, so you can stick for a couple of hours, studying all this.</font></font><br>
<br>

 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maintenance</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As he wrote, not without difficulties. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main problem is the lack of automated system monitoring and notification of server owners about problems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hopefully these features will be added soon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the meantime, I have to look into my personal account, monitoring equipment operation parameters, monitoring the temperature of server components, monitoring the network, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experience in the IT field helps. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps someone with an insufficient technical background may have problems. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5bb/38b/a4d/5bb38ba4dce4e68732dda8e9e7dd6a57.jpg" alt="1"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
True, most of the difficulties were solved at the very beginning of participation in the testing program. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would be nice to have a detailed setup manual, but I think this is a matter of time.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most interesting - income and expenses</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is clear that this program is not SETi @ home, the main goal of PC owners is to make money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The best solution for this is a powerful computer with several virtual machines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The proportion of overhead in this case is much less than if you use one physical machine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, in order to raise a virtual machine, and then run a game service on it, you need technical knowledge and experience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But there would be a desire - you can learn. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Energy consumption is much less than in the case of mining. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I know what I'm talking about, because at one time I tried various options for the extraction of digital coins, although not for long. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here are the average energy consumption according to tests:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1 server (i5 + 1070) - one virtual machine ~ 80 kW * h / month.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1 server (i9 + 3 * 1070) - 3 virtual machines ~ 130 kW * h / month.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1 server (i9 + 2 * 1070ti + 1080ti) - 3 virtual machines ~ 180 kW * h / month.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the very beginning of the beta testing program, payment for machine resources was purely symbolic, $ 4-10 per month per one virtual machine. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then the payment was raised to $ 50 per month based on one virtual machine, subject to the continuous operation of the virtual machine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a fixed payment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The service soon promises to introduce per-minute billing, then, according to my calculations, it will turn out about $ 56 per month for one virtual machine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not bad, even when you consider that part of the income is consumed by taxes, bank commissions, as well as electricity bills and provider services.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to my calculations, the payback of equipment, if purchased exclusively for the gaming service, is about three years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, life expectancy (including physical depreciation and obsolescence) of computer hardware is four years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The conclusion is simple - it is best to participate in the program if you already have a PC. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The positive thing is that now the demand for the service itself has grown. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company plans to introduce a new per-minute billing, as I mentioned above, so the payback period is likely to decrease in the near future.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thoughts on and prospects for service</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I think that the distributed gaming program is a great option for gamers with powerful PCs who can recoup their costs for their own equipment. They themselves do not need cloud games, but if there is an expensive car, why not return some of the costs or even pay for the equipment completely? In addition, the option of participating in a distributed gaming program is also suitable for companies like mine, where there are 100% of power that is not used. They can be converted into money, which is especially important in the current crisis conditions.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Distributed gaming is a kind of cloud smartbox that is available to a wide range of consumers. It provides an opportunity to receive rewards to owners of powerful machines, providing resources to third-party users. Well, gamers, in the end, do not experience problems with cloud games, since the servers are located at most a couple of tens of kilometers away from them, and not hundreds or even thousands, as is often the case with users of most cloud gaming services. And the larger the distributed network, the higher the quality of the game.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the near future, cloud and distributed gaming will coexist, complementing each other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the current environment, when the load on gaming services is growing, this is ideal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The popularity of games and gaming services will continue to increase in the future, after the pandemic ends, so that distributed gaming will gain momentum. </font></font><br>
