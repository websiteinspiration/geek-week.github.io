Only one book with the rules of the role-playing game has on its cover the message "Book Confiscated by the US Secret Service!" This RPG is the GURPS Cyberpunk, a 1990 addition to the Generic Universal Roleplaying System, published by Steve Jackson Games. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the morning of March 1, 1990, GURPS Cyberpunk author Lloyd Blankenship and his wife were woken up by six Secret Service agents who invaded their home and confiscated a laptop, printer, and even telephone. Then the Secret Service went to the office of Steve Jackson Games, where Blankenship worked as a senior editor, and did the same. The office was still closed, and Secret Service agents nearly knocked out the door before the still half-dressed Blankenship did not explain to them that he had keys.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I asked Steve Jackson in a letter if he remembers the day when his company was stormed by agents whose primary job is to protect the president from bullets. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúVaguely enough,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúWhen they invaded the office, I haven't come yet. The company president was there, he called me, told me what was happening and advised me not to come, because no one was allowed into the office. Therefore, that day I did not come across the guys from the Secret Service, but later we talked for quite some time. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Secret Service confiscated the computers on which the Steve Jackson Games BBS was running (people used this technology when there were no online forums and comment sections yet), as well as all computers that had files related to the then unpublished GURPS Cyberpunk. They opened the boxes, damaged the knife for opening letters, trying to break open a closed clerical cabinet and, according to rumors, ate candy-dragees from someone's table.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to Jackson, ‚Äúthey behaved unceremoniously in the office. Created real chaos. Not like vandals, but the mess turned out pretty good. I can not say anything about the story with sweets - they were not mine. But they certainly bent the letter opener and left strong scratches around the cabinet lock. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then no one understood what was happening. The search warrant was sealed, but since GURPS Cyberpunk was taken, it was logical to assume that for some reason it was in it. Jackson says the author of the rule book was inspired by works of art in the high-tech low-life genre of William Gibson and Bruce Sterling.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúThe characters usually had devices that turned them into cyborgs,‚Äù he says. "But it was not always so. The most popular game scenarios were espionage, high-tech attacks, protection against such attacks and their various combinations with many betrayals and intrigues. It‚Äôs worth noting that even after 30 years, it still remains science fiction. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31e/651/59e/31e65159e516b647f55dbed8539b7f7d.png"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Cyberpunk GURPS Basic Guide contains rules for exploring cyberspace and hacking networks.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
It was hard for Jackson to explain all this to the Secret Service. Despite the fact that the book contained rules for transferring the player‚Äôs consciousness to a clone of a different gender, the next day after the search he was informed that the company was publishing a ‚Äúcomputer crime textbook‚Äù. When he protested and said that all this was fiction, the answer was one: "All this is real." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The strangest thing in this story is not that government officials were unable to distinguish a science fiction book from reality, but that the confiscation was carried out for their own reasons. Although the warrant was sealed at that time, everyone assumed that the reason for the search was GURPS Cyberpunk; but the truth was even stranger.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Today it may seem ridiculous, but in the late 80s, the US was swept by hackermania. The news constantly talked about computer crimes, and the film "War Games" convinced society that children could start a nuclear war. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúIt was stupid, to say the least,‚Äù Jackson says. ‚ÄúAll the hype was fanned by the media, which was helped by law enforcement officers (they liked using horror stories) and the‚Äú hackers ‚Äúthemselves (they, like any smart teenagers, loved to brag and come up with reasons for boasting, which the trusting public took seriously)."</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When a hacker who called himself a Prophet hacked into the mainframe of the telephone company Bell South in September 1988 and copied the file from there, it was perceived as a serious threat. It was just a text file, but it described an advanced 911 system that Bell South used to prioritize and recognize emergency calls. The company rated this stolen file at $ 79,449 - this amount was obtained by summing the salaries of all employees involved in writing, editing and storing the file, as well as the cost of the computer equipment on which the file was stored ($ 31,000 for a computer, $ 6,000 for a printer and $ 850 per monitor) and the Interleaf software that created the file ($ 2,500).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The information contained in the document was not top-secret. Basically, it was administrative, and all the information from it could be found in a document that Bellcore </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
(the company owner of Bell South) sold to anyone for $ 13. Strongly overestimating this file, and therefore exaggerating the significance of the crime, Bell South attracted the attention of the Secret Service to it to scare teenagers who might want to crack the company‚Äôs security system again. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In his youth, Blankenship was a member of the hacker group Legion of Doom (the same one where the Prophet was) under the pseudonym Mentor. In 1986, after he was arrested for a computer crime, he wrote an essay </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Conscience of the Hacker</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(‚ÄúHacker Conscience‚Äù), which, after being published in the Samizdat magazine Phrack, became known as the Hacker Manifesto (Hacker Manifesto). Later, fragments from a document stolen from Bell South were published in the same magazine. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Four years after his arrest, Blankenship had already left a criminal path. He was no longer a young computer criminal; he got a real job. However, he still managed BBS from home and worked for a company that had its own BBS. This BBS in the Steve Jackson Games was jokingly called the Illuminati.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00a/159/da3/00a159da30ab6603c03ec4fd1f231094.png" alt="image"></div><br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GURPS Cyberpunk actively borrowed surroundings from science fiction books of the 80s, for example, from Neuromancer. To the extent that the concepts from William Gibson's fundamental novel are highlighted in the glossary of the desktop RPG with asterisks.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The idea that the forum owned by the RPG publishing company should be closed to the Secret Service, because there you can publish a stolen text file with publicly available information, is obviously ridiculous. However, this is exactly what happened. When the agents did not find this file in the equipment of Steve Jackson Games, they took away instead a computer book with the name Blankenship on the cover.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It took Jackson and his lawyer a few days to find out all this, and a few more months to get their equipment back. When it was finally surrendered, most of it was inoperative. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúThe equipment was sent to the lawyer‚Äôs office in one large box without packaging material,‚Äù Jackson says. ‚ÄúFor example, the hard drive was simply put inside the PC case, where it hung freely and fought on the motherboard during transportation. It is difficult to attribute it to ignorance; someone did it on purpose. ‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The release of GURPS Cyberpunk was postponed, and the rules had to be almost completely rewritten from scratch based on notes on playtesting and memories. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The loss of BBS, a way of direct communication with fans, was also a big blow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI guess it seems funny from the outside,‚Äù Jackson says. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúBut the damage to the business made me fire half of the employees, and that‚Äôs not funny at all.‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Jackson filed a civil lawsuit against the Secret Service, and, in particular, against the Chicago Department of Computer Fraud and Search Abuses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to the help of technically competent legal advisers who became interested in the recent increase in the number of computer crime cases (another 15 searches were conducted throughout the country as part of the Sundevil operation), Jackson and three of his employees received 300,000 in damages and attorney fees.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Later, these legal advisers organized the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to protecting civil rights online. This search also inspired Bruce Sterling, the author of science fiction books, who wrote such fundamental cyberpunk novels as The Schematrix and Islands on the Net, to turn to the documentary genre and write The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Steve Jackson Games has survived and is still publishing games, including Munchkin, Toon and Discworld Roleplaying Game. Remembering the search, Jackson says that he almost buried his company, "but managed to survive it." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
‚ÄúAccording to my most optimistic estimates, it cost us five years of development,‚Äù says Steve.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Lloyd Blankenship no longer works in the field of RPG. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, he is on the other side of cybersecurity - working as a UX designer for McAfee antivirus software developer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
GURPS Cyberpunk is still for sale. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The book thanks the US Secret Service for ‚Äúunsolicited comments.‚Äù</font></font></div>
