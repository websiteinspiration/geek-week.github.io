What is the difference between “word” and “concept” and why special techniques for memorizing words - pampering</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A word is a lexical unit with a set of meanings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The concept is more complex matter, poorly formulated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When a person begins to master a foreign language, he encounters lexical units (unfamiliar words), crawls into the dictionary, sees several meanings of the word and tries to understand which one works in this particular context.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Illustration: an Englishman learns Russian, encounters the word "table". Looks in the dictionary. It turns out that this is both table and desk. But desk is more like a table at which people work (not carpenters). Well, OK. Then he meets somewhere "passport office". Table?? He sees the sign “The table of orders” in the supermarket, But suddenly there is no table, and there is a girl at the counter with a tablet computer ... It begins to come to him that the “table” is still some point where the population is served on a specific issue (obviously, due to the fact that the employee who directly serves people sits, as a rule, at the table). He goes to the online store, sees the button "Order Table", understands that this is an extended value from the real (not virtual) "table of orders."</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As you learn the Russian language, it accumulates in the head certain meanings of the word “table”. It turns out that this is not only table and desk, but also board, and department, and much more. After that, the “table” begins to crystallize in his head, not as a word with a set of meanings, but as a concept. And he, once again encountering this word, already shines through the crystal of the formed “concept”, and already instantly grasps the meaning of the word in this particular context.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Students starting to learn a foreign language differ from advanced students, in particular, in the fact that beginners have words in their head (with two or three meanings). Advanced, due to the fact that they managed to come across this word in hundreds of contexts, in their head are not words, but concepts. They see any phrase through crystals of heavy, formed concepts over the years, so they take much less time to perceive a text than beginners.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose beginner and advanced students are given the same short text. The beginner knows all the words in this text, and even the specific meanings in which these words are used. It seems that they are with an advanced student in the same conditions. But the beginner still takes a lot of time to translate / understand the text, because you need to understand what specific meaning each word is used and collect the combined meaning of all the words in the sentence. An advanced student, because he thinks not with words, but with concepts, almost instantly grasps the meaning of each phrase and the whole text - he shines through the crystals of complex concepts in his head.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is why most methods of memorizing words are pampering. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, you have learned, in half, with a couple of meanings of the word apply ... Apply is a difficult concept, in Russian there are no direct correspondences for it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in order for words to crystallize into concepts, you need to work with different contexts, with sentences. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And make sure that all these sentences are understood correctly - do not be lazy to look into the dictionary once again or check with the teacher.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Sadness</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Have you noticed how diverse officials, company representatives, when you try to consult with them, are often annoyed if after two phrases you were unable to figure out their profession or internal procedures as well as they understand? They are engaged in these procedures every day, it seems to them that everything is outrageously elementary. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The manager through whom I interact with the landlord: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“What is incomprehensible? Write a regular statement so that the amount of the deposit is credited to the rental account. ” Stop. In whose name, in what form ?? I understand that she has been cooking for 8 hours a day for years. For me it is less than 1% of work tasks, I need to concentrate as much as possible in order to complete this task. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the grocery in a row are bags with a variety of cookies.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Give me this cookie (pointing to a specific package) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Which one? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Here it is (I pull the index finger, it almost rests against the package) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Is this ?? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Yes. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - This is not a cookie. These are biscuits ... (looks at me like an idiot) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Curtain. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Almost all instructions are written in such a language that you can understand them only if you ALREADY know how to use the gadget. Their authors talk to themselves. From the first pages begin to use heavy concepts, each of which requires a separate thorough input.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc7/fbc/0e3/dc7fbc0e3ad9c2594288ddfa4a722d4e.jpg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A rustic man of about 50 years old to a sales assistant: "The phone is needed so that it takes a long time to charge." Salesman: “Here are two interesting devices: one has 4050 milliampere-hours, the other has 3500. This one, which has four gigabytes of RAM, four gigabytes of resolution, Full-HD resolution </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
and a proprietary shell, is a program that works in addition to the bare android . Accordingly, it consumes processor resources. And the second RAM has a smaller gigabyte, the processor frequency and screen are lower, but it’s on a bare android. ”</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Amazing, isn't it? In the seller’s head, all these things do not exist at the level of information units, but at the level of heavy concepts, he easily juggles with these concepts, and can simultaneously compare a number of complex parameters. He sincerely does not understand how it is possible not to grasp his thought - after all, he just said what a corporate shell is ... For the buyer, these are raw, information units that have just been brought in half in his head in sin. He is not capable of comparing all these parameters at such a speed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is a very serious difference between a "unit of information" and a "concept." Why do they say: until you work in a profession, you won’t really figure it out. Work experience (or teaching) contributes to the conversion of raw units of information received at the university into “concepts” due to repeated reflection in different contexts ... But “concepts” already allow us to draw system conclusions and compare some complex parameters with others.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What is terrible is that most teachers do not understand this difference. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People, unfortunately, as they always talked to themselves, so talk. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Coming into the teaching profession does not change anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They do not want and cannot (as a rule) take the place of someone who does not understand the subject. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Retelling the same material for many years, they do not even notice how units of information are transformed in their head into heavy concepts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And they require the student’s brain to do the same in one semester. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not do like this…</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Pain</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61c/9bf/38a/61c9bf38ac08e9f639daea6a09729886.webp" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the worst problems of mankind, IMHO - the inability to express thoughts. The purpose of the speech acts, it seems, is to convey some kind of information. In practice, people almost always talk to themselves. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Intercity driver: “When will we go?” Answer: "Soon." What in his understanding is "soon", you have to find out separately, and you need to plan the next 5-10 minutes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"When is the soup ready?" The answer of a relative with 40 years experience in preparing soups: “I don’t know.” After a few leading questions, it turns out that she does not just know - she knows perfectly well, with an error of only 10-15 minutes, and you just needed to make plans for the next hour.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In everyday life, such misunderstandings are somehow smoothed out - it is not always so important to know for sure, and questions can be asked. In everyday conversations, you understand the context, so it’s usually obvious to you where and WHAT you could potentially misunderstand. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In teaching, an inaccurate expression of thought becomes criminal in nature. Students are faced with a context unfamiliar to them, and the ambiguous wording instantly turns into a part of the audience falling out of the process.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Unfortunately, most university professors sin by expressing their thoughts inaccurate by building logic on a blackboard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, they like to throw 1-2 links out of this logic - it’s obvious! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at the last lecture, I [this missed link] analyzed in detail! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All the constructions went to hell, but he did not even notice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The magnitude of the problem is greatly underestimated - they are gigantic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lectures of university teachers can usually be understood in two cases:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You know the subject no worse than they do.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You additionally dig yourself, google, ask questions to classmates or the same teacher.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Before accepting the next candidate for the position of teacher of English, I ask him to hold for me personally 40 minutes of classes on a given topic. And I’m watching not so much for his methodological methods (it’s easy to correct it later), but for how he formulates the thought, I write down moments that could be understood in different ways. Most often, the lesson has to be stopped after the first 10-15 minutes: people demonstrate a criminal inability for the teacher to express thoughts. After that I make a decision - a specific case of correction or too much trouble lends itself. And each, absolutely without exception, each teacher has to be taught to formulate explicitly.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For instance. A common mistake teachers (and almost all people have) is the abuse of pronouns. Especially the pronoun "this." The teacher is lazy to reproduce the name of the phenomenon in its entirety, it simply refers to it with the pronoun: "... and this gives us reason to believe that .." In practice, from his previous speech, 2-3 different conclusions can be drawn as to what he meant under "THIS". Part of the audience is lost. And we are not yet discussing the common case when a student did not listen attentively at all, and he does not have a single interpretation of “this”. The student missed the ENTIRE passage, he does not understand further constructions, the whole lecture is to hell.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In everyday life, due to the fact that someone incorrectly formulated, and someone incorrectly interpreted (and was too lazy to clarify), there are quarrels, fights, resentments. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In teaching, this is a failed learning process, which we observe everywhere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is sad.</font></font></div>
