<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dealing with the junk in my home office - and lately I‚Äôm definitely not the only one doing such things - I blew dust from a fairly large number of things I had forgotten. I had a bunch of electronic devices that I have not used for years - Amazon Echo Dot, Ouya, a prepaid phone with a bunch of disconnected applications from Google, etc. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Under this handful, the unexpected was revealed: an additional key block for my wireless keyboard, which I use in daily mode. My model, Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard, has a digital block as a separate wireless module, and I obviously removed it and forgot about it. I mentioned this case in our work chat for all kinds of jokes, with a sarcastic remark like ‚Äúwho uses it like that today?‚Äù</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In response to me, an unexpected avalanche of opinions fell over the digital block, which I, in principle, should have foreseen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, I write for the magazine Ars Technica. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If an object is in any way connected with any form of electric current, then we will find an opportunity to argue about it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And we argued - the editorial staff gave out jokes and memories related to the digital block over the past decades. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is followed by a handful of opinions from our employees regarding the digital unit, ranging from ‚Äúindispensable‚Äù to ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù.</font></font><br>

As a child, I grew up in a typical American suburb of the 1980s, so my earliest memories were from a school computer lab furnished with new computers from Apple. For the most part of my life, I believed that Apple itself provided these computers to schools in order to hook students with such a cunning advertising move not only to computers in general, but also to computers, programs and OS from Apple in particular. However, my superficial study of this issue revealed only one example of such a move on the part of Apple, which took place in the 1980s exclusively in California. Apple had difficulty trying to get federal lawmakers to introduce tax reductions on computer donations.</font></font><br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, I did not print this at school. This is an IBM 031 alphanumeric copy rock drill, which is discussed below. </font></font></i><br>
<br>

<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The digital block was located at an angle, and the numbers were located, like on a telephone keypad, and not like today on computer keyboards. However, its location next to the QWERTY-keyboard appeared for the first time.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
The history of the digital block is rather blurry, at least in the matter of its transition to computers. We know that the appearance of the block was patented in the United States in 1914 by the inventor of Swedish origin, David Sandstrand, although for computers of his time, and not for typewriters. To clarify the issue, I contacted the Living Museum and Computer Laboratory in Seattle, because they have a lot of classic PCs. They told me about two IBM products. At</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3232 series of computers</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , launched in 1971, quite a lot of actions had to be performed from the keyboard, and their version of the keyboard with a digital block may have become the first among computers with an electronic display, both consumer and everyone else. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, the IBM 031 alphanumeric copy rotary hammer, launched in the 1930s, was perhaps the first device that most closely resembled a modern keyboard with a numeric keypad, and it was used by an army of clerks who drove data. The photo above shows a digital block of a different location, but it is possible that for the first time it was invented specifically for use with a QWERTY keyboard.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So I can‚Äôt say how my elementary school in Texas acquired an Apple IIe fleet. However, I learned to print on them already in the third grade, and maybe earlier, in a program that I could not find later. And although by that time the Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">program</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> [a </font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">popular program for teaching computer printing in the USA / approx. perev.</font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ], our school used a rudimentary monochrome application that simply gave me commands to print repeating words and phrases, without illustrations that would demonstrate how to arrange my hands. I always thought that the name of this program was PRIMR, but now I can not find any traces of it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I mention all this because I can‚Äôt remember whether there were digital blocks on computer keyboards at my school or not. However, I remember that this program taught me to type by touch, without taking my hands off the middle row of keys. Not sure how a text-based program could teach this. Therefore, as a teenager, I never reached for digital blocks, even when they tried to push me in this direction of video games. However, this, probably, would be easier to do than to make my Gravis Gamepad bust to work with a large number of programs.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I did not rely on the digital block until I graduated and got the first formal job: working with clients and technical support from a telephone broker who had filed for bankruptcy shortly before (at the beginning of 2003 it was not the best time for job search). It was a hemorrhoid job that included strict rules prohibiting us from redirecting frustrated customer calls to a manager if we, front-line infantrymen, could not help them with problems such as a broken service or obviously fraudulent contract terms. And for every angry call or report on a dropped service, it was necessary to fill out a support request by clicking on the digital block when filling in such details as user IDs and collocation points.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, of course, I pushed to quickly click on the keys of the digital block in the reverse order, and when I have to process a large amount of data, I prefer this layout. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, when I was fired in the bankruptcy process, I took this as a sign from the higher powers that govern my fate of using keyboards, and decided that in the future I would try my best to avoid the digital unit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thoughts about the digital block return me to that desolate cubicle desert, where the main food for conversation was a quarrel over food stolen from the refrigerator. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this regard, I prefer keyboards without a digital block, and I would like as many laptop manufacturers to offer keyboards with a digital block as an optional option.</font></font><br>

<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Defenders of the digital block from our edition</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Next are the reviews of my colleagues about the digital block. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ron Amadeo, review editor</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : is this a serious question? Yes, an auxiliary keyboard is vital for me when using a computer, and when it is not on the laptop, I just get lost. It is ideal for quick use of the calculator, for entering sequences of numbers in the specification table. If in a sentence I write more than two numbers in a row, I move my hand to the right. In addition, I use it to enter a bunch of special characters using alt codes that I memorized. ALT + 0215 for "√ó" in "1920 √ó 1080", ALT + 0151 for a long dash (-), ALT + 0128 for the euro symbol "‚Ç¨". And it was really difficult for me to enter these alt codes into the text, because I don‚Äôt think about them at all. I already have them in my muscular memory!</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have not tried laptops with a digital unit, because laptops are primarily designed for mobility. My laptop needs to fit on my lap in an airplane, train, in the limited space available to a blogger, and models with a digital block are simply too big. However, I‚Äôm already used to the lame level of performance on a single-screen laptop. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eric Benjman, Managing Editor</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: In the 80s, when I was in high school, I had very few opportunities to learn how to program and generally work with a computer. One option for me was a local vocational school. There, in addition to BASIC programming courses, there was also a course called ‚Äúdata processing and computational operations‚Äù, which was a strange mixture of learning the COBOL language and entering data into a computer (I recall, it was 1983). When entering data, the numeric keypad was actively used. There, for example, there were tests consisting only of entering infinite rows of 6-8-digit numbers, so I had to master in this matter to complete the training.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since then, I have always gravitated towards keyboards with a digital block. The only exception was the 2nd generation Apple Wireless Keyboard. I bought this one because I didn‚Äôt like the dominance of wires on the table, but even then I bought an additional block of digital keys on Bluetooth from a third-party manufacturer. And when Apple nevertheless added a wireless version of the keyboard with a digital block, I bought myself one and have been using it ever since. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although I normally print blindly, it still seems to me that to enter a bunch of numerical data it‚Äôs easier to switch to a digital block. When I work on a laptop, sometimes I even postpone such tasks until later, until I get to the desktop computer. </font></font><br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jim Salter, technology reporter</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : if the keyboard does not have a numeric keypad, I do not need it. Honestly, I use this unit only once every one or two weeks. However, without it, the computer does not seem to me "real." </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nate Anderson, Associate Editor</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: on a small laptop I‚Äôm still ready to put up with the lack of a digital unit, but when I get to 15 ", I start to demand it. Yes, of course, it‚Äôs a little annoying when the keyboard is shifted in relation to the screen - but not so much when I need to drive in digital data, but there‚Äôs no digital block. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For most people, digital blocks are not needed - but I still have two keyboards with them. This is because on my old wired Mac keyboard, in addition to the digital block, there are still full-size cursor keys, keys page up / down and home / end. As an author and editor, I need to navigate through the texts, so I absolutely need such keys, so I always buy keyboards with a number pad - just not because of the number pad itself. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lee Hutchinson, Chief technology editor</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: a keyboard without a numeric keypad - like pants with a cutout on the ass. I honestly bought a beautiful special Varmilo keyboard without a digital block with white backlit keys and tried to work with it, but all the time, many times a day, I tried to hit my fingers on the table in the place where this block was supposed to be. It turns out that I enter all the numbers from the digital unit, and I do it for so long that it would be too painful to fix this muscular memory. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I already have a lot to do without learning to enter numbers from a long row of keys, like a little undergrowth.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, according to which of the employees uses the digital unit, you can always say which of them played adventure games from Sierra in the 80s. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These your truncated keyboards will be useless if you suddenly want to download DOSBox and play old adventure games with text parsing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How will you move your character? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Checkmate, assholes!</font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">John Broadkin, chief IT reporter</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : I would prefer that my desktop computer does not have a numeric keypad on the keyboard, because then I would not have to reach my touchpad so far with my right hand. However, my favorite Unicomp Model M mechanical keyboard for Mac is only like that, so I learned how to live with it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I still mostly use horizontal numeric keys, as I learned them all, and for me they are an integral part of the QWERTY layout. And to use the digital unit, I have to look at the keys every time. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Timothy Lee, Senior Technical Policy Reporter</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: I do not use a digital block at all. I grew up on computers without it (Apple II +, and then Macintosh Plus), so I never learned how to use it. For all my life I have had several keyboards with a numeric keypad, but I don‚Äôt remember that I used them to enter data to a large extent. Most of the time I spend on a 13 "MacBook Air. It doesn‚Äôt have a digital unit, and I don‚Äôt miss it. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chris Lee, author</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : I used to enter data into a computer for hours and would kill anyone who tried to take it from me my digital unit. And today I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs quite convenient, sometimes it is necessary for me. Well, it just collects dust.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, I write a lot, and it would be possible to decide that I enter characters from Unicode. Especially mathematical. And finding characters like ‚Ç¨, √ó, and ¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø should be time consuming, right? Indeed, to speed up the input of all these uncomfortable characters, you supposedly have to remember the codes. Nah, don't have to. To write mathematical identities, you need to know the LaTeX commands (when using the equation editor for Word). Well, in general, it was for uncomfortable characters that they came up with keyboard shortcuts. ‚ÄúMmult‚Äù ‚áí √ó, ‚Äússhrug‚Äù ‚áí ¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jeff Dunn, commercial editor</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : I will give a schizophrenic answer, admitting that I have both a full-sized keyboard and a keyboard at 60% (and I used quite a few keyboards with a numeric keypad). It seems to me that 100% of the keyboards look more attractive in terms of design. I imagine exactly this kind when I think of the word ‚Äúkeyboard‚Äù. However, in practice, I use the number row of keys more often than the digital block, possibly due to the long-term use of laptops as the main computer.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, thanks to keyboards without a digital unit, I stretch my arms somewhere less, and my shoulders strain less, so ergonomics also win. And although I don‚Äôt have a gaming computer, I think that a large free space for an armpit is useful in most modern PC games. Therefore, I am not a big fan of the digital block. The type of buttons, the feel of the keys and the aesthetics are much more important to me. </font></font><br>

<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Orik Lawson, creative director</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : I used to use a full-size keyboard with a numeric keypad and I like utilitarian things. It is good not only for entering data - for many things, such as, for example, exiting text input mode in Photoshop, a large enter key can be useful. However, such a wide keyboard has its own price - because of the remote location of the mouse, you have to move your shoulder in a not entirely ergonomic way.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Recently, I hit mechanical keyboards (I haven‚Äôt completely plunged into this rabbit hole, but still ahead), and decided to try switching to a 65% keyboard. It looks like a 60% keyboard, narrow, but it has an extra 5% with cursor keys and buttons for navigating pages. I cannot refuse individual cursor keys, I use them too often in graphic applications. I am still waiting for the production of the aluminum case and the printed circuit board that I ordered for my keyboard, made from scratch. Then I‚Äôll completely immerse myself in the rabbit hole, and until then I‚Äôve been using the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Magicforce 65</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> as a test option </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So far I‚Äôm missing a digital unit, but I really like the opportunity to move the mouse closer. Since I have nothing to do with mountains of numbers, I miss the digital unit more out of habit. Such a replacement was worth it, and I need to better monitor ergonomics, so for now I will focus on this option. But I was thinking about putting a separate digital block to the left of the keyboard. You can find advantages in keeping your right hand on the mouse while working with graphics, and enter numbers with your left. I think I‚Äôll wait until I finish the next keyboard and I‚Äôm convinced that it suits me. </font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Peter Opascar, line editor</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: I use only laptops because I can‚Äôt sit still. All the time I want to move from place to place - either on the kitchen worktop, then on an island in the middle of the kitchen, then on the table, now on the bed, then in Starbucks. During isolation, I had to remodel the garage into a workplace that we call Garagebucks. So the smaller the laptop, the better. And for video games, I don‚Äôt need a digital unit, I don‚Äôt play them. And I don‚Äôt play games because I hate fun. </font></font><br>

Since about 2005, I mainly worked on laptops, on the keyboards of which they simply do not exist. And when I recently bought new keyboards for a desktop gaming PC and home workstation, I specifically chose keyboards without a digital block, because it eats up the space on the table, and I love minimalism. I like the thought-out space where everything is carefully selected and serves its purpose. From my point of view, the digital block is useless. As well as function keys - I would not even notice if the keyboards with them ceased to be produced at all. And I‚Äôm still a developer - I believe that for most ordinary users, with the exception of accountants, they are even less useful.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, in certain product reviews, I can note the absence of a numeric keypad on the keyboard, because I know that some readers disagree with me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think it‚Äôs important for me to always remember that I do not always represent the audience for whom I write reviews.</font></font></div>
