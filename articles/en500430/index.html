<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I also think that many will be curious about the metamorphosis that has occurred with the job market in connection with recent events.</font></font><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, first, a little about yourself.</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
It is solely for the reader to “normalize” the experience. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am a developer primarily on the .NET + MS SQL stack. He started working as a student, with a total work experience of almost 20 years. Four years ago, he moved from Senior backend .NET developer to the team lead of a small team in Moscow. Two years ago, old friends lured me to Germany for the "Signora", and six months later again became the team leader of a small German and Indian team.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And so, in February this year, I returned from Germany, full of confidence that behind such a cool “playing coach” like me, there will be a line of employers. While I was engaged in relocation (hello to the Kashira customs post), while in family affairs (greetings to maternity hospital No. 8), I did not notice how the virus fell on the world. I had to urgently revise my vacation plans, and so far the economy has not completely contracted, to look for a warm, stable place. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No sooner said than done! Posted an English and Russian resume on Headhunter and on Linkedin, responded to “tasty” vacancies and waited. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, about the bad.</font></font></b><br>

<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Which companies remained on the market?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In a word - respectable. Alas, far from always IT is their main source of income. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This must be taken into account. I got a lot of calls from banks, brokers, credit bureaus. There were, however, food companies. They can be divided into two categories: or having serious state. orders, or just successful guys who did not lose from the crisis. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Oh yes, there were a few more integrators and a couple of outsourcers. But I didn’t want to find a job for them. At this stage of my life, I first of all looked for stability and so that my nerves would not break.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For the same reason, despite my good English, I did not try to look for remote work for foreign companies. A couple of my friends who worked for Europe and the States have already lost their jobs, several more are in limbo. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How is the interview going?</font></font></b><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
In 40% of cases, everything starts with a call, 45% - a letter, 5% - a message in the messenger, 10% - response to hh.ru. If, after the contact had taken place, mutual interest remained, an interview time was appointed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first interview with HR was in 90% of cases by phone, 10% on Skype and it took me 30-60 minutes. This is a long time. Maybe I was too chatty, but HR thoroughly asked about my experience all-all-all and more. They, for the most part, were friendly and empathetic, and also surprised me with a fairly good knowledge. In addition, they were actively interested in what I expect from a new job. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were, however, such HRs that were not able to interest anyone in anything. They chattered the job description in a robotic voice and were not able to answer questions. But there are not many of them. And thanks to accelerated natural selection, it will soon become even smaller. Some interviews ended with the understanding that we were not on our way. Which was immediately neatly voiced, and this is cool. I think so.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Much more often they told me that they would pass on information to colleagues. Then there were two options: either HR disappeared, or promptly scheduled a technical interview. In the event of disappearance, the main regret for me was that I did not understand what had gone wrong and how to act in the future if the problem was on my side. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second interview is technical. It went through 80% on Skype and 20% on Zoom. As a rule, 1-2 interviewers participate in it. But a couple of times I spoke with 5 people at once! I must say that techies are not yet used to interviewing remotely. Many people feel this format is uncomfortable. Over time, I guess, get used to it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a job seeker, I’m also unusual. But it minimizes time costs. Takes 1 - 1.5 hours. Maximum - 2 hours. Even during the interview, it happens that technical malfunctions occur. Interviewers may have poor lighting, poor microphone, and poor internet. A couple of times the guys sat in front of the window and I talked with dark silhouettes. The same set of problems may be on the side of the applicant. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seems commonplace, but I would advise everyone to check in advance that you are clearly audible and visible. The course of interviews was standard: tell about yourself, answer questions, solve problems, ask counter-questions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is noteworthy that the interviewers were divided into two categories: those who, in the case of my mistake, briefly reported the correct answer, and those who simply went on to the next question.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this radically changed the atmosphere of the interview. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I never wanted to get to where there was no feedback right during the interview. And where the employer did not show his human interest. Because I'm moody and I want to work with cool people. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I must say that with feedback, and indeed with non-verbal signals, difficulties arise. Because of the remote format, they are not easy to read. And techies on the other side of the barricade are also worried. They meet the candidate with caution, it is probably difficult for them to understand what kind of person is in front of them. It is far from immediately possible to melt the ice. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sometimes there was a third interview - with the leader. But most often he was present at the second.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Interviews took place on different days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is logical, because </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the goal is to cram everything on the same day so that the candidate does not ride several times, it makes no sense. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, as you can see, a remote interview is not like a remote interview. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But only - remote. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And if you decide or are forced to change jobs - it is quite possible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will just take some serious effort.</font></font></div>
