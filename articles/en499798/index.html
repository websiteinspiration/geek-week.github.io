      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/company/vtb/blog/499798/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The modern world is obsessed with speed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Imagine that you live in a world when an application for a plastic card or a loan is submitted in the usual messenger, it is almost instantly approved and you immediately receive the requested product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Imagine that such a ‚Äúcontact‚Äù in the chat can become a replacement for the mobile banking application. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not complete, of course, but taking over 60 percent of frequently used functions such as a balance sheet, transferring money to friends and paying in the store. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is exactly what is happening now in Azerbaijan, where all this has become possible thanks to our development.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cd/1ea/8c0/2cd1ea8c05867d1dd689a3f0d6736210.png" width="1000"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Under the cut, we will tell you how the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a bot came about, how it was developed, developed and promoted.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Background</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In 2019, our team in Azerbaijan was set a non-trivial task: to come up with how to quickly increase the volume of business without any serious investments from the parent company. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fact, it was a financial startup, where any decisions that could satisfy 4 main requirements were taken as ideas:&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Highest Availability. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new product in its basic version should not burden the client either financially or energy-intensively. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ideally, no more than a few seconds should elapse between ‚Äúwant‚Äù and ‚Äúuse‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we started, there was no talk of coronavirus, but now ‚Äúcontactless‚Äù communication is in demand more than ever.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><b>  . </b>          . ,            ,      .<br>
</li>
<li><b> .</b>    MVP (  )              .<br>
</li>
<li><b> .</b>                   ,   .<br>
</li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After a long brainstorming session, the team realized that the chatbot meets all 4 criteria. Not to say that this was a completely new idea in the banking sector, but our chat bot was to become not just a useless ‚Äútalker‚Äù, often annoying the client with his stupidity, but a full-fledged and clear interface of interaction with the bank. In fact, a sort of banking client, only packaged in the format of "contact". Nobody has done this yet.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a rule, advanced chat bots are developed in Telegram. However, market research showed that only 16% of instant messenger users use Telegram in Azerbaijan. Most Azerbaijanis predictably sat on WhatsApp (more than 95% of users) and, which turned out to be very curious, on Facebook Messenger (about 75% of respondents). It would seem that the logic suggests that you need to bet on WhatsApp, however, in the case of Facebook Messenger, we got a unique link between the display of ads within the user‚Äôs feed, instant transition to the messenger and fast delivery of the product. As a result, MVP was decided to do on Facebook.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In parallel with research, we studied legal regulation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out that there are also no obstacles, since the state in Azerbaijan is actively moving towards digitalization: there is a regulatory permitted issue of unidentified payment cards, there is a developed state system that accumulates the financial behavior of citizens. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Central Bank is also developing a platform for remote identification of customers by banks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, the legal, financial and technical capabilities of our bot gradually emerged.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Development</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Technically, the solution was divided into 3 components:&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chatbot development.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Development of an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù solution for a loan conveyor.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Integration 1 and 2 with ABS VTB Azerbaijan and local processing.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
</li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Chatbots.Studio company located in Kiev was chosen to develop the chat bot. The loan conveyor was created with the help of VTB Group's partner - PST Lab (Minsk). A project manager was sent to Baku to coordinate the implementation team, and the project headquarters was located in Moscow. Thus, a distributed team was formed immediately in 4 countries.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It took us some time to set up and motivate the administration and implementation team working on the spot. Because people who go to work in a bank usually get used to strict regulations and rarely changed rules. But we had a pure start-up with constantly changing tasks and regular testing and rejection of hypotheses. But we quickly rebuilt.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Chatbot programming is a simple task at first glance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But here we needed not just a "talk", but a banking service that complied with all the requirements of information security. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, it required the ability to flexibly configure scripts using templates and a special microservice architecture. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, MVP is a living organism that constantly requires improvements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I must say that, despite the conditions that are completely atypical for working on Agile, the development from A to Z itself took only a little more than 2 months.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Functionality</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
How our bot works: most often a new client learns about us from advertising received directly in the messenger, or from a message from friends who already use our services. Upon transition to contact, the client can get a digital non-personalized DIRECT card. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b4/962/d35/9b4962d358beee6fa3dbe814b2a8ce70.png" width="400"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since the client has not yet been identified by the bank, he can deposit no more than 100 AZN on the card (this is about 60 USD), and the total volume of his operations cannot exceed 1,000 AZN (600 USD). These limits allow the client to evaluate the level of service, its advantages, and then confirm their identity with a visit to the bank or via video link. In this case, all limits are removed.&nbsp;</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An interesting point: it looks a little funny when the name of the dog or fictional character that users write on the digital map is displayed. But after the user passes the identification, in his details, of course, the real data is already displayed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Immediately after the establishment of the card through the messenger, you can replenish the account from other cards (a compact WebView pops up), make transfers, pay in the store, on the Internet or through a QR code, pay for utilities. You can borrow money by generating your own QR code and sending it to friends. You can even withdraw cash through a one-time password via SMS. In other words, use it as a full-fledged card through a full-fledged client bank. Only almost instantly, without a visit to the bank and in the usual messenger.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2n/l2/gm/2nl2gm9nqi9xnmn-a1cishldrvm.png" width="200"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You can also apply for a loan through the messenger. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To get a solution, you need only two things: 1) the desire of the client; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2) his passport number. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All data for analysis is pulled by API from public services.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Implementation</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The project was expected to encounter difficulties due to its unusual nature for classical banking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many local services with which integration was required, for example, to replenish cards from cards of other banks, had outdated data exchange technologies that were not built into the ‚Äúinstant‚Äù paradigm of the chat bot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To adapt to them, the development of additional solutions was required. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the main difficulties were of human nature.</font></font><br>
&nbsp;<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For the success of a startup, it is important that not only the product, but also its team meet the principles of innovation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is an opinion that restarting a business on a digital platform certainly requires the creation of a completely new, digital team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our case, for a number of reasons, this was not possible, so there was a hard way to adapt the old bank team to a new reality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here are just some examples of the difficulties that had to be overcome:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The need to abandon the usual axioms, starting from the desire to definitely see the VTB logo instead of a new digital brand and ending with the reluctance to abandon classical banking procedures even at low risks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, they decided simply with the logo: we use the DIRECT brand, but everywhere we denote the parent brand - DIRECT powered by VTB.</font></font><br>
</li>
<li>,         ,   .            .<br>
</li>
<li>         ,       ,       (  ¬´ ¬ª).<br>
</li>
<li>        ,       .<br>
</li>
<li>   :       vs.    .<br>
</li>
<li>    ,    ,    .<br>
</li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fairness, it should be noted that not only the team sometimes showed unpreparedness for an innovative product, but also the customers themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, the undeniable advantage of opening a real card in just a few seconds through the chat bot played a cruel joke. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out that many customers, having activated the card, abandon the product, simply because they do not even suspect that the card can already be used. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I had to make an additional emphasis on this in the client way.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What's next?</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
While DIRECT is being tested at Azerbaijani customers, other banks of VTB Group are already beginning to take a closer look at the technology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now the product is used by several thousand customers, and judging by the feedback, people like the speed and convenience of working in the messenger. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Technically, our solution allows you to deploy another digital bank in the messenger in just 2 months. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Additionally, for greater coverage, we are also developing a chat bot on WhatsApp. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this messenger is a leader in the post-Soviet space, while the Facebook messenger in some countries is not as widespread as in Azerbaijan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But already the results that we see on Facebook allow us to call the start of the project successful.</font></font></div>
