Coronavirus and self-isolation certainly influenced our ML projects. From my talk you will learn how models, metrics, and processes have changed. The second part of the report is also related to the current situation. I talked about boomerang projects - we do them not because they improve the metrics in the moment, but because we believe that these projects will be useful in the future. For example - at a time like now.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/r6/be/jxr6benukbypmowp90etsb2cpku.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
- First we will get to know you, then I will tell you what kind of tasks our team solves and what areas of ML projects we cover. After that, I‚Äôll tell you directly about specific cases and examples, about how projects have changed under the conditions of the coronavirus. And in the final part I will talk about boomerang projects. This is when we did something long ago that seemed very cool to us, because we believed in it in the name of all the best. And now, in coronavirus, this project came back to us and helped make a cool feature. So let's get started. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/py/6c/e1/py6ce1digt5clxgwwmwlhvb_q8e.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's get acquainted. What kind of ML team are we? We solve ML-problems for three services: Taxi, Food and Shops. There are four main areas of optimization of our activities: optimization of the budget, business processes, the system as a whole and the product.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now more about these areas. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/eb/pe/czebpe0i8kyjlmgbtmxdptsx1ve.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Budget optimization, as the name implies, is related to the budget. We have a certain amount of cash or other resources and there are targeted actions that we want to get with these resources. For example, we want to give users discounts to encourage them to take more taxis or order at the Food or Shop. Or we want to give some kind of subsidy to the driver to stimulate demand. Or we want to predict what the demand will be in the region in order to plan courier changes and bring them out in such a way as to deliver all orders on time. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In these tasks, using ML, we either predict the business or solve the targeting problem in order to achieve the greatest impact effect.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kj/cd/jd/kjcdjdib2hvx8dnvmtxtlb6sg7i.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next direction is the optimization of business processes. There are a lot of large systems in Taxi, Food and Shop. For example, user support. In addition, there is a photocontrol of the car and its quality: whether the car is broken, dirty, the interior clean, etc. Or, for example, checking that the driver is not tired and everything is fine with him. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In all these tasks, one can increase the share of automation, automate some parts of the processes precisely due to ML-models. For example, to predict what the user‚Äôs appeal consists of in the appeal text. Or classify the picture for satisfaction of service requirements.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/wc/2k/uawc2khqa2oyo52mcyb2t2km5ae.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next direction is the optimization of the system as a whole. There is a large area in Taxi that is responsible for the platform‚Äôs efficiency, that is, how to balance supply and demand with the help of prices, how to assign a car to order to be as efficient as possible, and other algorithms that affect the efficiency of systems. Here, using ML methods, we help colleagues make these algorithms even more cool.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, you can predict where the car will be in five or ten seconds and assign the car not taking into account the current position, but taking into account where it will be in a few seconds when the driver physically accepts this order. Thus, it is possible to avoid the situation when the car is assigned, but the driver, taking the order, drove the turn to the user, he has to turn around and the delivery time rises sharply compared to the promised one. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gv/x1/df/gvx1df6m0dyvyt4acqkbsxoxzre.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next direction is product optimization. We want our application to be as convenient, functional and useful as possible for the user.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, we suggest points B so that he can select a destination in one click. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or we recommend convenient landing points so that it is as easy as possible for the user and driver to meet each other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Either we rank the restaurants according to the user's order history so that he can order where he liked best, or where he will be interested to try something new. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to recommendations, there are tasks of predicting various statistics for the future, so that the user can find out how long the car will arrive or when the food will be delivered.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Changed Projects</font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We met, and now I will tell you on specific projects how they changed under the conditions of the coronavirus. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/g7/bo/8eg7bo-kh8cjk8eng2gm1enxy24.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I'll start with a project to predict demand at Yandex.Lavka. Briefly, what is the essence of the project? In order to bring couriers to different areas and do it most efficiently, I want to understand what will be the demand in a particular area. Where more couriers are needed, where there will be fewer couriers? Therefore, a task arises - for each shop to predict what will be the demand in its area in the future. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This model has a set of requirements. For example, to make it as interpretable as possible, because if something goes wrong and the model is wrong, then we need to understand why it happened.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition, we would like the model to be as stable as possible, since demand is still a rather sensitive quantity that changes actively over time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And to make the model more stable, we, firstly, decided to use a linear model, such stability and interpretability. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Secondly, to make it more stable, we decided to use the RANSAC method, and this had a very positive effect on quality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even reduced the error by a few percent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, everything was perfect. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But under the conditions of the coronavirus, something unexpected happened. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can express your hypotheses about what went wrong in this whole scheme, and after that I will tell and it will be possible to verify.</font></font><br>

Conclusion: sometimes a feature that seemed very good to you can suddenly become a bug, and you will need to fight it. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/w_/lg/qsw_lgkvjdpccchplozx1w9iwfy.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The following story, namely UpSale, also concerns Yandex.Lavka. To improve the product, we made a recommendation block on the basket, in which, based on the contents of the basket, we recommend the user various additional products that might be of interest to him. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To evaluate the effect of this, we launched an A / B test, with which we decided to measure the average bill - how it changes when there is a recommendation block and if it is absent.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What could have happened here? Since demand was growing very actively and, moreover, people began to order more and more, during the A / B test, a constant linear growth trend was clearly distinguished, within which the average check was growing. And this created an extra variance in the data, as a result, standard methods of calculating the statistically significant could detect that the change is statistically, precisely because of this additional variance associated with growth. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To deal with this problem, I had to invest in additional analytics. Specifically, the method for assessing the significance of significance is called CUPED, I highly recommend reading more about it, a very cool and useful method.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With its help, we were able to take this linear trend into account, compete with it and get a more accurate estimate of the statistical significance, making our metrics more sensitive by reducing variance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Conclusion: sometimes the usual methods may stop working, and you need to be prepared for this at least mentally. </font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The following story concerns support automation in Yandex.Taxi. As I said, support is a fairly large area in our business. How to optimize support costs due to its maximum automation?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To do this, we process a lot of messages using the ML-model. We made a fairly large system and began to transfer it from customer support to driver support. But under the conditions of coronavirus, firstly, the message flow increased very much, because the situation was changing, drivers began to write more often. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Secondly, the meaning of these messages has also changed, because at least new situations have been added, for example, in connection with the appearance of omissions with QR codes.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Due to these two factors, the share of automation, that is, the share of requests to which we respond with the ML-model, has fallen by about half. To deal with this situation, we re-compiled a new tree of topics on which drivers turn. Retrained a new model for them, thereby won back the drop in this share of automation not to the initial level, but it turned out to return most of it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Conclusion: the priority of the task can grow very actively, because volumes have grown. But at the same time, the main KPI can fall dramatically. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It happens and vice versa. Here, for example, is the task associated with the forecast of price changes in Yandex.Taxi. Let‚Äôs briefly tell you what the point is.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uz/zt/y5/uzzty5lvf9d213ljcuhuibyxkny.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From the point of view of the system, it is disadvantageous when demand begins to sharply prevail over supply, since this creates an imbalance that hinders the efficient appointment of drivers for orders, and it is necessary to raise the price in order to attract drivers to the imbalance zone. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You might encounter this effect when you have ‚Äúpurple‚Äù prices in the app. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To make this happen a little less often, we notify the user that in the near future the price may change. We hope that due to this, some of the users will leave a little earlier than they originally planned, and the demand will seem to spread out over time. There will not be such a sharp effect of the prevalence of demand over supply.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But, under the conditions of coronavirus, the demand for taxis has greatly changed its character. Now ‚Äúviolet‚Äù prices practically do not exist in the system. That is, supply and demand more or less always coincide. Therefore, notifications in this current situation have become redundant, the functionality is not in demand, and we decided to turn it off. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Thus, the priority of a task can drop very sharply, although its main KPI has grown very much. It‚Äôs like in this case, when we really achieved the effect that supply and demand became more or less the same. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's move on to the next case - the launch of SuperApp Yandex.Taxi.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sj/by/vq/sjbyvqrcc1qayidvrat_jtvk7ag.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The idea to combine Food, Shop and Taxi in a single ecosystem, so that it was convenient for the user to solve several problems at once, was planned for a long time. Under the conditions of coronavirus, the relevance of the Food and Bench has increased dramatically. Moreover, since so many restaurants, let‚Äôs say, have lost the opportunity to directly sell their services and goods, in order to provide them with an additional platform where they could continue their work, the priority of launching SuperApp has increased sharply.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Due to the fact that ‚ÄúSince priority has increased very much, the speed of internal processes for developing SuperApp has grown at times. As for ML, there are a lot of new tasks, usually recommendations. For example, the name tags that you can see on the screen are called shortcuts. And you need to recommend including a shortcut with a trip point, suggesting the user somewhere to go by taxi. Or a shortcut of different restaurants where you can choose the restaurants that he likes, the categories of Shops, etc. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A separate task is to mix it all together so that, on the one hand, the most relevant is upstairs, and on the other, that everything is enough beautifully fit on the net?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Conclusion: sometimes a crisis can act as a catalyst for a project, raise its priorities, speed up its launch much more strongly, and affect other projects. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I would like to tell about the impact on other projects using the example of the prediction of popular locations. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xc/hg/kw/xchgkwxipapo-qg5q0gl2q2afuo.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Initially, the problem was solved at the expense of the arrival point, in order to facilitate the life of new users of the Yandex.Taxi application. But they have not yet used the service, so we do not have stories of their trips. But we can highlight the popular locations in the city or area where they are located, and recommend them. That is, we solve the problem of the cold start of new users.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the way, on the slide you can see a histogram of the distribution of points B among users in Moscow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The largest peaks are airports, which is quite expected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And yes, of course, this histogram was made before the coronavirus. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I propose to come up with a hypothesis of what are the peaks in the center of Moscow, that is, what other points are quite popular compared to the rest, but are not airports. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make your hypotheses, and after that I will say the correct answer.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div class="spoiler" role="button" tabindex="0">
                        <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Correct answer</font></font></b>
                        <div class="spoiler_text">     ,       .      ‚Äî  .</div>
                    </div> <br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4p/wl/a-/4pwla-ukuwycpzgyh2ee0dar3vc.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But what happened with the launch of SuperApp? Of course, when launching SuperApp in the Taxi application, I want to keep the user feeling that he is still in the Taxi application. Therefore, an important requirement is that taxis must be present in the extradition. Otherwise, the user may have an inconvenience: he opens the Taxi application, but there is no taxi, but there are restaurants and a shop. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Solving this problem of a cold start, we reduced the proportion of situations by 16 times when there was no Taxi shortcut in the issue. Thus, we previously received a satisfactory version of SuperApp and, in particular, rolled it out earlier. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Conclusion: the emphasis in the KPI of the project can change very much, it is also worth being prepared for this.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/iw/ld/oeiwldxswgcrs-454gh313b9w98.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In summary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About feature-bug is not just a remake of the famous phrase, but a reality that should be borne in mind. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The usual methods that we use may stop working. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You must be mentally prepared for this, and it is advisable to have a plan B for your basic tools. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The priorities of the tasks can vary greatly, and in the opposite direction compared to the KPI of these tasks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Final conclusion: a crisis can be a catalyst for projects and change emphasis even in KPI of other projects. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now we will move on to the next part, in which I will talk about boomerang projects, that is, about those projects that we once did, but they returned to us and brought good.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Boomerang Projects</font></font></h2><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/ij/rj/jvijrjvlh9jq7gsbnah3d2ueki4.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Once upon a time, people went to work in the morning, and returned home in the evening. And they did it by taxi, on the basis of travel histories one could predict where the users have a house and where they work. Moreover, so many people added travel points to their favorites and signed that it was home, and it was work. Based on such data, a model could be trained. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This was originally planned in order to prompt the user to add new addresses to his favorites. However, in the end, this was not useful for the original purpose. But it turned out that knowing where a person lives and where he works can be useful, so the model was brought to a production state and saved for future use.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this future, of course, has arrived. Namely, it was very actively used in pushing the opening of a new restaurant in the vicinity. Or that the Shop‚Äôs area has expanded, and now it also delivers to this point. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I would not want, of course, to spam everyone in the district. Therefore, such pushes were sent only to those who, for example, live in this area or who potentially had work in it, until they introduced self-isolation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This decision allowed to receive tens of percent of additional orders in the A / B test, which was very nice.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Conclusion: initially, your ML predictions may not have a place to use. But if there is no easy way to use these predictions, then such a place may never appear. It turns out the problem of chicken and eggs. In general, sometimes just a cool model is done, then a consumer is on it and everyone from this becomes a little happier.</font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/tf/fe/pxtffewy4rr4ibgs96--vf-oihm.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A similar situation is associated with offline visits to organizations. Once, my colleagues and I went to a cafe. When we left it, one of us got a push to the application: so you went to a cafe, would you like to leave a review? And here we had the idea that some people note where they visited, you can get this information on Yandex.Maps. And thus, it‚Äôs not just to find out the history of user orders, but to gain knowledge about offline restaurants that may be potentially interesting. Based on this data, you can find in the same way additional people who are worth notifying. And this also gave additional percentages of orders. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Conclusion: ML-models are, of course, cool, but sometimes working with specific data can be no less valuable than the ML-model, and also bring profit.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The following story is about proactive support. As I said, we are automating support using the ML model. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/c9/ee/nzc9eetheu1fnfymojmvfn2vta8.jpeg"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But an interesting thought arises: in order to optimize support costs, it is not necessary to optimize support itself. Let's reveal this idea in more detail. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have telemetry data about the trip. This is data from the accelerometer, that is, if there are a lot of sharp turns, then maybe something happened during the trip. And it is possible to determine the probability of contacting support on the basis of telemetric data. Suppose it seems to us that this probability is large. Then you can communicate with the user in advance, thereby preventing the case when he writes to support himself. This is the first.</font></font><br>

Secondly, we can interact with the driver if he often has such moments and on the basis of these data it seems to us that we could often complain about him. We kill two birds with one stone - we improve the service with a feedback from the driver and get an additional source of optimization: we reduce the number of calls for support. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Conclusion: do not limit ourselves to the initial framework that we set for ourselves in the task. It is worth going out of them to find something cool and new. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The following story is more technical. We are all data Scientists, we love Python very much, we love to train model models on it, because it‚Äôs convenient, nice and, in general, the language is good. But, of course, if you taught a model in a certain language, you may have a natural desire in the same language to use it in production and apply it.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We have part of the application of these models was written in Python. There was a Python service and there were a number of, let's say, problems, usually related to the performance and load that the service is capable of withstanding. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To ‚Äúlay straws‚Äù and calm the soul, we decided to rewrite the service in C ++ at the beginning of the year. We did it. They added additional restrictions on the request and saw that the response time had greatly decreased, everything was fine. And we began to keep the load higher at times. All done, forgot, live.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And now, under the conditions of coronavirus, the load has grown very much, but we did not particularly notice it. No technical problems arose and it is valuable when you need to make new cool features, correct and take into account the peculiarities of the situation in the models. We could do just that, and not repair and scale the service. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Conclusion: do not forget about the technical scaling of your solutions. Because when they break, you will have to repair them, instead of making important changes to the service.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Summarizing this part, it‚Äôs worthwhile to understand: there is a relationship between the cool things you do and their use. If you are guided only by the principle that cool things are not worth doing until a specific customer for the project and the desired KPI from this project appear, then you miss some of the cool things - although you could do them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Second: it is worth remembering that ML data is also important. And the way you process them, structure them and enable others to reuse them can be no less valuable. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next thought: do not limit yourself in solving the problem. Perhaps your new approach may take you to a whole new level.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this, a little boring point: for all this, do not forget that your decisions should work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can train an arbitrarily cool model model in a Jupyter Notebook and enjoy what a cool quality she has. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you can‚Äôt bring it to production or it won‚Äôt work, unfortunately you won‚Äôt improve this world. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the end, I would like to say the following. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Coronavirus mildness is the right time to take a critical look at your projects and processes and change them if necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main thing is to try to be objective, draw conclusions from your observations and not be afraid of changes, try to do everything better. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was very nice to talk about our observations and conclusions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thank.</font></font></div>
