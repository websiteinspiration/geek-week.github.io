      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/505462/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two years ago, we realized one important thing: customers are more and more interested in small forms and small kilowatts, and launched a new line of products - mini and micro DPCs. In fact, they placed the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù of a full-fledged data center in a small closet. Like full-fledged data centers, they are equipped with all necessary equipment in terms of engineering systems, including power supply, air conditioning, security and fire extinguishing components. Since then, we often have to answer many questions regarding this product. I will try to briefly answer the most common of them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The most important question is ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Why did we do this, and why do we need micro-data centers? Microcode is certainly not our invention. Peripheral computing based on mini and micro DPCs is a growing global trend, the so-called Edge Computing. The trend is clear and logical: the movement of computing to the place of creation of the primary information is a direct result of the digitalization of the business: the data should be as close as possible to the customer. This market (peripheral computing), according to Gartner, is growing at an average of 29.7% per year and will increase by almost five times by 2023 - up to $ 4.6 billion. And with it the need for a reliable infrastructure for peripheral computing equipment.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Who may need this? Those who need unified solutions that can be quickly and inexpensively implemented and scaled up in regional branches, where a fast response of information systems is required regardless of the quality of communication channels, for example, to remote branches of a bank or an oil concern. Most of the objects of oil and gas production (wells, for example) are significantly removed from the central offices, and due to the narrowness of the communication channels, enterprises need to process a large amount of data directly at the place of their receipt.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The ability to locally process and aggregate data is an important, but the only factor of interest in this product. MicroCODs are most often used if the organization does not have the ability (or desire) to use the services of a commercial data center or build its own. Far from all, for various reasons, they are ready to choose between their own and those of others, between long-term projects for the construction of a data center and public clouds.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
MicroCOD is an alternative accessible to many, which avoids the long-term and expensive construction of its own data center, while maintaining full control over the infrastructure. Commercial structures, industrial enterprises, and government services have an interest in micro-data centers. The main motive is the typification of the solution. It is suitable for those who want to get the result quickly and for adequate money - without design and construction work, without preliminary preparation of the premises and getting it into ownership.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And here the following query arises: the product is one, and the motivation for its acquisition may be different. How to satisfy customers with different needs in one solution? 1.5 years after the start of sales, we clearly see two equal requests: one of them - to reduce the cost of the product, the other - to increase reliability by increasing battery life and redundancy. Combining both requirements in one ‚Äúbox‚Äù is quite difficult. An empty way to satisfy both of them is to make all structures modular when all engineering systems are implemented as removable, separate modules, with the possibility of dismantling during operation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The modular approach allows you to adapt to the wishes of the customer to increase the degree of redundancy or, conversely, to reduce the cost of the decision. For those who are interested in reducing the cost, you can remove some redundant engineering systems from the design or replace them with simple analogues. And for those who care about performance, on the contrary, they need to ‚Äústuff‚Äù micro-data centers with additional systems and services. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another big plus of modularity is the ability to quickly scale. If necessary, you can increase the infrastructure by adding new modules. This is done very easily - by connecting the cabinets to each other.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And finally, the leader question, which always interests everyone, is about the site. Where can i place micro-data centers? Indoors or also outdoors? And what are the site requirements? Theoretically, it is possible of course both there and there, but there are ‚Äúnuances‚Äù, as the equipment for indoor and outdoor solutions should be different.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If we are talking about standard constructs, it is better to place them inside, and not outside, since the IT load requires a specific approach. It is difficult to provide quality service on the street, under snow and rain. To accommodate the micro-data center, you need a room that is suitable for overall dimensions, where you can lay power lines and low-current networks, as well as install external air conditioning units. Actually everything. It can be installed directly in the workshop, in the warehouse, in the cabin or in the office. No complex engineering infrastructure is required for this. Relatively speaking, this can be done in any standard office. But if you still really want to outdoors, then you need special models with a degree of protection IP 65, which are suitable for outdoor installations. As an outdoor solution, we also have climate cabinets. There are no such loadsother reservation and climate requirements.</font></font></div>
