      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/491672/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are really important things in the world. Maybe there's. Must be. Yes, anyway. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there are things “important” in the world. Feel the difference? “Important” things are full at work, in politics, on television and the Internet. Today we’ll only talk about work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So, we (and maybe you) at work have individuals who like to give importance to what they do and say. From the outside, it looks funny and comical, and ridiculous. Although, if you do not pay attention to importance, a miracle happens: you stop noticing it and begin to believe. And everyone around us begins to believe.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So the “important” things disappear, and the important, Important, IMPORTANT, and SUPERAVE appear! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am for this to not be. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything should be adequate to reality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, when I read letters and listen to speeches, I always apply a filter to them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It already automatically works as a predefined smoothing and blurring of the background in the smartphone’s camera. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main filter, of course, is quotation marks.</font></font><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quotes</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The targeted use of quotes began for me by accident. It is clear that sometimes they do this sometimes - show quotes with your fingers - but not systematically, but from case to case. And then they added me to the chat League of developers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For a second - I’ve been doing programming 1C for 15 years, but I can only call myself a developer for fun. And there are guys and girls who have been practicing 1C for a maximum of 8 years. But they are the Developer League. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I tell them: let's rename the chat room, I have two options: the “League” of developers or, even better - the League of “developers”. Offended. And I liked it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I began to mentally add quotes wherever common sense requires it. Basically - to written messages, of course. Since then, very strange messages have reached my brain. I will give a few examples.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Colleagues, on such and such a date we will have a “strategic session”. It will "discuss" plans for the "development" of the company, the "results" of the year, and a collection of "ideas" from employees will be organized. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Ivan, there appeared an “urgent”, “important” “task”. “Needed” for you to appreciate it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dear Colleagues! Something needs to be done “urgently” with “performing discipline”! This attitude to the terms of “tasks” from the leadership is “unacceptable”! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To all company employees! Urgently "familiarize yourself" with the new version of the "process" for managing "sales"! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, etc. The arrangement of quotes has turned into a funny game, a kind of direction, when the same script (the source text) can be painted in different intonations. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quotation marks look great on all sorts of posts, ranks and achievements.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, on Habré I have a Legend icon. Just kill, and there should be quotation marks. I am not a Legend, but a "Legend." And better - "Legend, EPT." </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Around me there are project managers, “project managers” and “project managers”. Feel the difference? Immediately the whole world is hidden, the history of life, fate. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And there are so many “specialists”, nowhere to spit. “Analysts”, “consultants”, “sales managers”, “sales” managers, “heads” of departments, “team leaders”, “team leads” and team “leads” - there is nowhere to put a test. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Quotation marks, of course, are best kept secret. At least, you should not write letters with quotes to people who do not understand this - it will look like a kindergarten.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But inside my team, I shared this method a long time ago. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It works magically - people just stopped writing “important” messages because they know that they will be read through quotation marks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyone who has written some kind of “importance” immediately becomes a source of healthy humor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is very uncomfortable, so the "importance" in messages is quickly treated.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whatever that means</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second filter in my “rating”, or rather, the modifier - “no matter what it means”. It is used, unlike quotes, in both written and spoken language. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Usually - where someone is trying to seem smarter than they really are. There is such a technique for reasoning - either to put in a word that no one knows, or to say a phrase that is inseparable from the context, without setting forth the whole context. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I will give a couple of examples from the Internet and communication with colleagues. I can’t resist in places and use quotation marks. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A new entrant in the quantum computing market (whatever that means) with “unique technology.” </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Good afternoon, colleagues. According to the “assignment” of the manual, each department should formulate a “Product” (here they put the quotation marks themselves), which you “produce” for customers. Whatever it means.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Kostya said that we need to establish cross-functional interaction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whatever it means. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Colleagues, Vasily Viktorovich asked me to convey that he would be late because his temperature is too low. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whatever it means. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Using this modifier in a team quickly teaches people to speak normally. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So that you don’t have to ask again what the person means, where the legs grow from, and what for he said it at all.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Absurd Modifiers</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When quotation marks and “whatever that means” does not fit, you can modify the phrase in an arbitrary way to give it an absurd color. The principle is simple: we believe that the person who wrote or said the phrase wanted to joke, or give his words a humorous connotation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Particularly suitable for news headlines and articles. Let's try it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
FAS, for no reason, for no reason, prepared a bill, "dangerous" for the IT industry. Well, so as not to get up twice. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Wargaming, for an unknown reason (even to themselves), forbade the use of the word "Blitz" to its former employees. Whatever it means. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Global migration: in Windows 10, after updating, you cannot create a local account. How to live now ... That's all, boys, we disagree.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“1C-Retail Checker”: we meet an updated line of tariffs “1C-Goods”. Why are you sitting? Meet, meet! </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Microsoft has combined Word, Excel and PowerPoint in one Android application. Microsoft In the android application. In one. I'll go. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why Masterhost was doomed: an inside look. Maybe it's for the better? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suddenly: A simple trick to control procrastination. And you sit and do not know procrastinators. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Please stop recommending Git Flow. First find out what it is. But stop recommending already. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A new participant in the quantum computing market (what?) With a (next) unique “technology”. And you drink tea from a bag.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Immediately I apologize to the authors of the headlines - I have nothing against you, I didn’t want to offend anyone, and I don’t express my attitude to the topics of the articles by applying “filters”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's just that you are now in the “tops” of two sites, and then look for examples of laziness beyond the “top”.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What the hell?</font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I’ll explain everything now. Importance acts like a whirlpool funnel, whether it be work or personal life. I won’t touch upon personal life, everyone will figure it out, and at work, importance is evil. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It starts small. Here are people sitting, adequate, normal, working, smiling and happily going to work. And then the importance comes up. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, someone suddenly becomes an Elder. Programmer, developer, manager or cleaner. Or everyone has projects, but for someone - An important project appears. Or Important customer. Or a strategic direction. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And here comes the key point - how will the others accept the importance. If the project will be called "important", but not important, then everything is in order. If importance takes root without quotes, then write is gone. The first brick in the wall of importance appears.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And there the next one will appear, and very quickly. The importance is bewitching - both its owners and outside observers. It begins to penetrate everywhere - in communication, in priorities, and in the distribution of resources, including monetary resources. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The one who has gained importance is afraid to let go of it, because importance gives advantages, even if sometimes invented ones. ChSV loves the importance of lunch, and will defend it, no matter what. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then miracles begin. Importance begins to cover up incompetence, failures, and even own frank stupidity. Importance becomes an integral part of work processes, because without it it turns out that most of the kings that surround you are naked. And who wants to stay in the middle of the office without pants? There are, of course, such personalities, but they are looking for the public in other, more crowded places.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Normal, adequate work processes, results, achievements and failures begin to hide under the importance. Importance fills everything that happens, like a sticky, sticky resin. It becomes impossible to move - not just to change something. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you want to talk with an important guy - be kind, respect his importance. No Hello, just Hello. You can’t "have an idea" - only "I ask you to consider the possibility of implementing the following proposals." Don’t try to write “you don’t have to do anything, I’ll do everything myself, only approvals are needed” - only “I know that nothing will work without you, therefore I ask you to consider the following issues, in terms of implementation, at the nearest Program Committee, if possible, Of course, understanding your schedule ... ".</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main thing is not to miss the growing importance at the very beginning. The higher it grows, the more difficult it is to get rid of it later. In this sense, importance is like weeds. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the crap is that importance cannot be eradicated once and for all. You need to work with her constantly, because the desire to increase your own importance is one of the instincts inherent in a person. You can’t eradicate it, you shouldn’t even try. It is only necessary to track the sprouts, and weed the garden. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have seen several times how importance spoils companies. For example, he worked in a company where there were only programmers, a couple of sellers and a director. No hierarchy, importance, everything is on “you”.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then off and on. Projects have appeared. Of course, they are more important than ordinary minor maintenance tasks. There were a lot of people, department heads were appointed. They didn’t do anything, they didn’t even pay extra money for the position, but you can’t drive up on a lame mare. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then the accountant, whom no one had noticed before, suddenly announced that the full-time driver first takes her (to the tax there or to the store), and then - programmers and managers to clients. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I added fuel to the fire - with career steroids I got the position of "Director of Quality" (whatever that means). And this really didn’t mean anything, just against the backdrop of the growing importance of everything around, I wanted to take some “honorable” place in the hierarchy. Then came the financial, commercial and executive directors.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In general, these are former programmers and sellers who suddenly become important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's all, the office is over. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost everyone who was in the beginning left. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I can’t say that this is bad or good, but I don’t want this for my team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I like working more than licking someone else's or my own importance. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, that’s it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thank you for reading my “article”. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Hopefully,” she will benefit you (whatever that means). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, what.</font></font></div>
