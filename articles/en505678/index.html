<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Planning</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The current server side for users was on Linux. Almost every organization has Windows servers, which cannot be said about Linux. The main strength of Veliam is its remote connections to servers and network equipment behind NAT. But this functionality was very rigidly tied to the fact that the router should have been a Mikrotik. And this obviously would not satisfy many. I first started thinking about adding router support to the most common vendors. But I realized that this is an endless race with an extension of the list of supported firms. Moreover, those already supported can have a different set of commands for changing NAT rules from model to model. VPN was the only way out of the situation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since we decided to distribute the product, but not as open source, it was no longer possible to include various libraries with open licenses such as the GPL. This is generally a separate issue, after deciding to sell the product, I had to sort through half of the libraries due to the fact that they were GPL. When they wrote for themselves, it was normal. But not suitable for distribution. The first VPN that comes to mind is OpenVPN. But he is GPL. There was also an option to use the Japanese SoftEther VPN. His license allowed him to be included in his product. After a couple of days of various tests on how to integrate it in such a way that the user does not need to configure anything and know about SoftEther VPN - we got a prototype. Everything was as it should. But, for some reason, this scheme confused us anyway, and we eventually abandoned it.But naturally they refused after they came up with another option. As a result, they did everything on regular TCP connections. Some of the connections work through the coordinator, some directly through the Nat Hole Punching (NHP) technology, which was also implemented on Free Pascal. I must say that I have never even heard of NHP before. And it could not have crossed my mind that you can connect 2 network devices, both of which are located behind NAT directly. I studied the topic, understood the principle of work and sat down to write. Conceived, the user is connected with one click to the desired device for NAT via RDP, SSH or Winbox without entering passwords and setting up a VPN. Moreover, most of these connections go past our coordinator, which has a good effect on ping and the cost of servicing these connections.As a result, they did everything on regular TCP connections.

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Translation of the server part from Linux to Windows</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were several problems when switching to Windows. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, the built-in wmic in windows does not allow WQL queries. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in our system everything was already built on them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And there was something else, but now I forgot why I finally refused to use it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There may be differences between versions of Windows. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the second problem is multithreading. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not finding a good third-party utility under a ‚Äúvalid‚Äù license for us, I launched the Lazarus IDE again. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And he wrote the necessary utility. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The required list of objects is sent to the input, and what kind of requests should be made, and in response I receive data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And all this in multithreaded mode. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fine.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After I configured pthreads for PHP, Windows thought that everything would start right away, but it wasn‚Äôt there. After some debugging time, I realized that pthreads seems to work, but it didn‚Äôt work on our system. It became clear that there was some peculiarity of working with pthreads in Windows. So it was. I read the documentation, and it was written there that for Windows the number of threads is limited, and, as far as I remember, implicitly. This has become a problem. Because when I started to reduce the number of threads at which the application worked, it did the work very slowly. I opened the IDE again and the functionality for multi-threaded object pinging was added to the same utility. Well, to the heap already and port scanning there too. Actually, after that, the need for pthreads for PHP disappeared, and it is no longer used.Further, several more functionalities were added to this utility and it works to this day. After that, the installer for Windows was built, which included Apache, PHP, MariaDB, the PHP application itself and a set of utilities for interacting with the system written in Free Pascal. As for the installer, I thought that I would quickly resolve this issue, as This is an extremely common and necessary thing for almost every software. Either I was not looking, or something else. But I constantly came across products that were either not flexible enough or expensive and also inflexible. And yet I found a free installer, in which it would be possible to provide for any Wishlist. This is InnoSetup. I am writing here about this because I had to search, suddenly I will save time for someone.which included Apache, PHP, MariaDB, the PHP application itself and a set of utilities for interacting with the system written in Free Pascal.

<h3>      </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I wrote earlier that the client part was a browser with a ‚Äúplugin‚Äù. So there were times when, then Chrome will update and the layout is slightly crooked, then Windows will update and the custom uri scheme will fly off. I really did not want to have this kind of surprises in the public version of the product. Moreover, custom uri began to fly after each Windows update. Microsoft simply deleted all its branches in the necessary section. Also, Google Chrome now does not allow you to remember the choice to open or not the application from custom uri, and asks this question every time you click on the monitoring object. Well, in general, it was necessary to have normal interaction with the user's local system, which the browser does not provide. The simplest option in such a scheme is simply to make your browser, as many now do through Electron. But many things have already been written in Free Pascal,including in the server part, so we decided to make the client in the same language, and not produce a zoo. So the client was written with Chromium on board. After that, he began to acquire various bindings.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Finally chose a name for the system. We constantly sorted through the various options while the process of remaking from the local version to SaaS was ongoing. Since we initially planned to enter not only the domestic market, the main criterion for selecting the name was the presence of an unoccupied, or not very expensive domain in the ‚Äú.com‚Äù zone. Some functions / modules have not yet been ported from the local version to Veliam, but we decided that we will release them with the current functionality, and finish the rest in the form of updates. In the very first version there was no HelpDesk, Veliam Connector, it was impossible to change the thresholds for triggering notification triggers and much more. We bought Code Sign Certificate, signed the client and server parts. We wrote a website for the product, started the registration procedures for software, trademark, etc. In general, ready to start.Easy euphoria from the work done and the fact that someone will probably use your product, although we had no doubt about this. And then stop. The partner said that it is impossible to enter the market without notifications in instant messengers. It is possible without much else, but not without it. After a short debate, Telegram integration was added, which suited us. Of all the current messengers, this is the only one that gives access to its APIs for free and without any complicated coordination procedures. The same WhatsApp offers to contact providers who take good money for using their services, all letters asking for access without laying were ignored. Well, Viber ... I don‚Äôt know who is using it now, because spam and advertising there are going wild. At the end of December, after a series of internal tests,and testing among friends, opened registration for everyone and posted software for download.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Distribution start</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From the very beginning, we understood that we needed a small flow of users of the system so that they would test the product in combat mode and give some first feedback. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Several purchased posts in the VK have borne fruit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Send the first registration.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here it must be said that entering the market when your company does not have a famous name, and at the same time providing agentless monitoring functionality in which you need to enter accounts from your servers and workstations, is very difficult. It scares so many people. From the very beginning, we understood that there would be problems with this and were prepared for this both technically and morally. All remote connections, despite the fact that RDP and SSH are encrypted by default, are additionally encrypted with our software using the AES standard. All data from local servers is transmitted to the cloud via HTTPS. Accounts are stored in encrypted form. Encryption keys for all subsystems are individual for all clients. For remote connections, session encryption keys are generally used.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All we can do in this situation so that people can be calmer is to be as open as possible, work on security and not get tired of answering people to their questions.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For many, the convenience and functionality of software outweigh the fear, and they register. Some individuals in the published posts in VK wrote that this software cannot be used because This is a collection of their passwords and generally a no-name company. I must say that this opinion was not one person. Many simply don‚Äôt understand that when they install other proprietary software on a server that works as a service, they also have full rights in the system and they don‚Äôt need accounting in order to do something illegal (it‚Äôs clear that you can change the user from whom the service is started, but this way, you can enter any account). In fact, people's concerns are understandable. Installing software on the server is a common thing, but entering an account is already a little scary and intimate, since a good half of people have one password for all services,And to do a separate account even for the test is lazy. But at the moment there are a huge number of services that people trust their credentials and not only. And we strive to become one of them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many comments were of such a plan that we stole it somewhere. This slightly surprised us. Well, the opinion of one person, but such comments were found in various publications from different people. At first they did not know how to react to this. Either sad that some people have the opinion that in Russia no one can do anything on their own, or can only steal or rejoice that they believe that this can only be stolen.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now we have completed the procedure for obtaining the EV Code Sign Certificate. To receive it, you must go through a series of checks and send a bunch of documents about the company, some of which must be certified by a lawyer. Obtaining an EV Code Sign certificate in a pandemic is a separate topic for the article. The procedure dragged on for a month. And this was not a month of expectation, but of constant requests for additional documents. Maybe the pandemic has nothing to do with it, and everyone has had the procedure for so long? Share it. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some say that we will not use it because there is no FSTEC certificate. I have to explain that we can‚Äôt get it and we won‚Äôt because because to get this certificate encryption must be in accordance with GOST, and we plan to distribute the software not only in Russia and use AES.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All these comments inspired some uncertainty that it is possible to promote a product into which you need to enter accounts, without being at the same time heard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even taking into account the fact that we knew that there would be those who are very negative about this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the number of registrations exceeded one thousand, we stopped thinking about it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially after, in addition to the negative of those who did not even try the product, very pleasant reviews began to appear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I must say that these positive reviews are the biggest motivator for the development of the product.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Adding remote access functionality for employees</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
One of the frequent tasks from clients is to ‚Äúmake Van access his computer from home.‚Äù Raised VPN on Mikrotik and did accounting for users. But this is really a problem. Users are not able to watch the instructions and follow the steps in order to connect via VPN. Different versions of Windows. In one Windows everything connects well, in another you need a different protocol. And in general, this was always associated with the reconfiguration of the network equipment that was the VPN server, and not all employees had access to it and this was inconvenient.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But we already have remote connections to servers and network equipment. Why not use the ready-made transport and make a separate utility of a small size, which you can simply give the user to connect. I just wanted to make sure that the user did not enter anything abstruse there. Just one ‚Äúconnect‚Äù button. But how will this utility understand where to connect if it has only one button. There was an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãonline building the right application on our servers. The system administrator presses the ‚Äúdownload shortcut‚Äù button, and a command is sent to our cloud to build an individual binary with wired information on connecting to the desired server / computer via RDP. In general, this could be done. But this is a long time, the administrator would have to wait first until the binary is compiled, and then download.Of course, one could simply add a second file with a config, but these are already 2 files, and for simplicity the user needs one. One file, one button and no installers. After reading a bit of Google, I came to the conclusion that if you add some information to the end of the compiled ‚Äú.exe‚Äù, it will not go bad (well, almost). There you can at least add war and peace, and it will work as before. Sin does not take advantage of this. Now you can simply unpack the application directly on the go, by the way it is called Veliam Connector, and simply append the information you need to connect to it at the end. And the application itself knows what to do with it. Why did I write ‚Äúwell, almost‚Äù in parentheses? Because you have to pay for this convenience by the fact that the application loses its digital signature. But we, at this stage, considerthat it‚Äôs a small price for such convenience.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3>  </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I already wrote above that after it was decided to make the product publicly available, and not just for my own use, I had to work hard and look for replacements for some modules that did not allow myself to be included in our product. But after the release, a very unpleasant thing accidentally appeared. The Veliam Server, which was on the client side, included the MariaDB DBMS. And she is licensed under the GPL. The GPL license assumes that the software must be open source, and if MariaDB, which has this license, is included in the composition of our product, then our product must also be under this license. But fortunately, the purpose of this license is open source, and not the punishment in court of those who accidentally make a mistake. If the copyright holder has a complaint, he will notify the violator in writing and he must eliminate the violation within 30 days.We found our mistake ourselves and did not receive letters and immediately began to consider options for how to solve the problem. The solution was obvious - the transition to SQLite. This database has no licensing restrictions. Most modern browsers use SQLite, and a bunch of other programs. I found information on the Internet that SQLite is considered the most common DBMS in the world, just because of browsers, but did not look for proofs, so this is inaccurate information. I began to study what threatens the transition to SQLite.that SQLite is considered the most widespread DBMS in the world, just because of browsers, but did not look for proofs, so this is inaccurate information. I began to study what threatens the transition to SQLite.that SQLite is considered the most widespread DBMS in the world, just because of browsers, but did not look for proofs, so this is inaccurate information. I began to study what threatens the transition to SQLite.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This becomes a non-trivial task when there are several hundred servers installed on clients with MariaDB and data in it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some MariaDB features are not available in SQLite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, for example, in the code used queries like</font></font><br>
<br>
<pre><code class="sql hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> <span class="hljs-string">`table`</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> <span class="hljs-string">`id`</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-number">1000</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FOR</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">UPDATE</span>
</code></pre><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This design makes not only a selection from the table, but also blocks the row data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And a few more designs also had to be rewritten. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But besides the fact that I had to rewrite a lot of requests, I also had to come up with a mechanism that, when updating Veliam Server, the client will port all the data to a new DBMS and delete the old one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also, transactions did not work in SQLite and this was a real problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But after reading the expanses of the World Wide Web, I easily found that transactions in SQLite can be enabled by sending a simple command when connecting</font></font><br>
<br>
<pre><code class="sql hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">PRAGMA</span> journal_mode=WAL;</code></pre><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, the task is completed and now the server part of the clients runs on SQLite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We did not notice any changes in the operation of the system.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New HelpDesk</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From the internal version to the SaaS version, it was necessary to port the HelpDesk system, but with some changes. The first thing I wanted to do was integrate with the client‚Äôs domain in terms of transparent user authorization in the system. Now the user, to go to HelpDesk and leave a request in the system, simply clicks on the shortcut on the desktop and the browser opens. The user does not enter any credentials. The module for Apache SSPI, which is part of Veliam Server, automatically authorizes the user under a domain account. To leave a request in the system when a user is outside the corporate network, he clicks on the button and a link arrives in his mail, through which he logs in to HelpDesk without passwords. If the user is turned off or deleted in the domain, then the account in HelpDesk will also stop working.Thus, the system administrator does not need to monitor the accounts in the domain and in HelpDesk himself. The employee quit - disconnected the account in the domain and that‚Äôs all, he won‚Äôt log into the system not from the corporate network, not from the link. For this integration to work, the system administrator needs to make one GPO, which</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Adds an internal site to the intranet zone</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">throws a shortcut to all users on the desktop</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The second thing that we consider essential for HelpDesk systems, in any case for ourselves, is to connect to the applicant directly from the application with one click. Moreover, connections must be made if the system administrator is on a different network. For outsourcing, this is a must, for regular system administrators it is also often very necessary. There are already several products that do the job of remote connections. And we decided to make integration for them. Now we have done the integration for VNC, and in the future we plan to add Radmin and TeamViewer. Using our network transport for remote connections to the infrastructure, we made VNC connect to remote workstations behind NAT. The same will be with Radmin. Now, in order to connect to the user,you just need to press the "connect to the applicant" button in the application itself. The VNC client opens and connects to the applicant, regardless of whether you are on the same network or sitting at home in slippers. Previously, the system administrator, using GPO, must install everything on the VNC Server workstations.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now we ourselves are moving to the new HelpDesk and are using integration with the domain and VNC. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very convenient for us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now we can not pay for TeamViewer, which we used for more than three years to work our support team.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are we planning to do next?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When we released the product, we did not make any paid tariffs, but simply limited the free tariff to 50 monitoring objects. Five dozen network devices and servers should be enough for everyone, we thought. And then requests to increase the limit began to come. To say that we were a little shocked is to say nothing. Are companies with such a number of servers interested in our software? We expanded the limit for those who made such requests for free. In response to their request, we asked some of them why they needed so much, did they really have such a large number of servers and network equipment. And it turned out that system administrators began to use the system in a way that we had not planned at all. Everything turned out to be simple - not only servers, but also workstations began to monitor with our software. Hence there are many requests for expanding limits.Now we have already introduced paid tariffs and the limits can be expanded independently.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Servers almost always work with either storage or local disks in a RAID array. And we originally made a product for them. And SMART monitoring was not interesting for this task. But taking into account the fact that people adapted the software for monitoring workstations, there were requests for the implementation of SMART monitoring. Soon we will realize it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the advent of the Veliam Connector, it became unnecessary to deploy a VPN server on a corporate network, or do RDGW, or just forward ports to the necessary machines for connecting via RDP. Many people use our system only for these remote connections. Veliam Connector is only for Windows, and some users of companies connect from home laptops running MacOS to workstations or terminals on the corporate network. And it turns out that the system administrator is forced, due to several users, to return to the issue of forwarding or VPN anyway. Therefore, now we are already finishing making a version of Veliam Connector for MacOS. Users of their favorite apple technology will also have the opportunity to connect to the corporate infrastructure with one click.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I really like the fact that having a large number of system users does not have to puzzle what people need and what will be more convenient. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">they write their wishes themselves, so there are a lot of development plans for the near future. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In parallel, we are planning to start translating the system into English and distributing it abroad. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not yet know how we will distribute the product outside our country, we are looking for options. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps more on that later there will be a separate article. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps someone who has read this article will be able to suggest the desired vector, well, or he himself knows and knows how to do it and will offer his services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will be grateful for your help.</font></font></div>
