<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Just like lizards, hiding in stones, and falling asleep like dead lethargic sleep to survive the winter, there are reptilians on Nibiru while interstellar night lasts. However, they do not lose time in vain. The ability of people to keep consciousness in a dream, accessible to few people, is common for them. And they continue to live, existing in the astral world - in the world of ghosts and dreams. They can even control the lives of others, penetrating the dark depths of their subconscious, telepathically inspiring their thoughts, and stimulating desires. It was accessible to people, until they appeared. They hid this gift from people, making them obsessed.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A star burst was inevitable. Her life cycle was drawing to a close. But by then, dragons had a ton of ways to survive this. They built underground cities as close as possible to the inner sun of the planet, whose nuclear fusion could warm them for a long time. These cities were airtight and earthquake-resistant thanks to polymers, they scooped up water from stocks under the ocean floor, and they had everything to live for a long time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Gutting the bowels of the planet, the dragons threw tons of metal into orbit, which included a lot of gold. They created a huge shield from satellite mirrors, which was supposed to take on the main blow of the explosion, and from metal dust in a low orbit formed an artificial ionosphere around the planet - a giant resonator, which served both as a solar sail and a screen. Feeding emitters from the surface to it, they changed the sound of their planet, and its orbit began to move away from the star long before everything happened.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When the power of light began to grow, lightning filled the electronic sail, and the orbit began to move away faster, but this did not last long. The explosion scattered all the gold that was in orbit through space, vaporized the atmosphere and oceans, incinerated everything that was on the surface. He threw the planet away from the star‚Äôs gravitational field, and since its mass decreased, it no longer attracted with the same force as before. The planet Nibiru, driven by a frantic wind, began its journey into outer space. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the dragons were able to survive this and survive. And when they left their shelters, they saw a lifeless desert under the stars, in which there was no more air or water. And what was left of their native star eventually turned into one of the cold glowing dots in the black sky.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The planet‚Äôs heart slowly began to fade away, because its luminary did not warm it anymore, and they could only hope that someday a new house would meet on their way. This could happen in thousands of years, but they had time. They knew that after they died, they could be born again and continue their work. They had an eternity to make plans.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When the dragons from the planet Nibiru discovered at the heading a habitable planet in the system of stars that pulled them into their field, they were glad. But they soon realized that they could not move to her, because she was already occupied by others, equal to them, called gods by people, whose power was beyond doubt. These gods created people, and gave them knowledge, and people served them. The gods were different, they had different people with different skin colors, physiques and facial types, similar to them. They even had different animals. It was their joint project for the exchange of genetic information brought from different star systems - the repository of life. Zoo, as people say.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
These gods knew that stars can telepathically transmit information, and they can also transmit dna code. They knew that the spontaneous generation of life does not happen by chance, but due to the evolution of consciousness, and that it exists initially in every atom of the Universe comprehending the experience of being. These gods, like dragons, knew about their immortality. They, with the help of people, built huge pyramids, and entering them in resonance with the Earth, left their body traveling to the stars. They were not required spaceships to transfer their body to other worlds. They could be born there. And also they could change the orbits of the planets, changing their sound with the frequencies of their thoughts, creating an inverse astrological relationship.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
People worshiped and exalted the gods, and so the gods received psychic energy from people. This energy gave them strength to translate ideas into reality. This is the same as if you like. Their main knowledge was that the thought is material, that the energy that the galaxy shoots from the poles, returns again to the center, and the worlds, like the foam of waves appearing along this path, are the vibration of the thought of the galactic sun. And like him, man also creates what forms the reality around him. The earth was a playground for these gods, they built civilizations there. And the rules were there as elsewhere - everything is allowed, and everything will return.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This power, which made it possible to translate thoughts into reality, was known to the dragons, and they wanted to take possession of it. Having fallen into the field of the Sun, Nibiru and staying there, but only in a very elongated orbit, gradually became a part of this world. Dragons also took part in the Earth project along with other gods. And they had a lot of time to come up with, just after time entering the solar system to become its masters. Over a long time of wandering, they learned to live in space, accumulate the energy of stars, and collect resources from planets. They created a new ionosphere shield from the golden dust around Nibiru, which was held in the standing waves and controlled by a network of satellites and antennas. Now he could serve them as weapons. Dragons became real space pirates, and were not ready to leave their ship Nibiru, which became the personification of their strength. They would be defenselessthrowing his planet and just moving to Earth, capturing it. They had to guard their prey. And they decided to use the Earth in order to realize their grandiose plan, which appeared at their very beginning - to put Nibiru into orbit around the Sun. And for this they needed the power of the gods. They wanted to expel the gods, and rule over people, since people were like gods and they also had this power.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order to gain this power, they needed to make people think about what they needed. Dragons began to act secretly. They left their DNA on Earth, now they had their own people there. Then they tempted other people with technology similar to the current one. What is a TV, computer, telephone, Internet? This is artificial telepathy. When people spoke all in one language, understood the language of birds and animals, they communicated telepathically, and the technologies on Earth at that time were completely different.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Telepathy is not only about knowing the thoughts of others. It also feel their pain. What people call conscience now. And besides, when everyone has telepathy, it‚Äôs impossible to lie. But it is a lie and lack of conscience that give the greatest material wealth. Such an opportunity to get more, living in ignorance, seduced many. Everything new is always interesting. And people refused telepathy, gradually replacing it with an electronic prosthesis, and not noticing how this happened. It was in a country called Atlantis.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now people could at any time remove a person from friends, pursuing their goals to hurt, and not know about it. People gained the happiness of ignorance, and this made it possible to control them, since mind control was the Trojan horse of this technology. People no longer knew where thoughts came from. They took them for their own, and even sold them. And people ceased to be like the gods who created them, for their eyes were closed and their ears could not be heard. After a while, the wise ones who led others along began to lie and manipulate their consciousness, obsessed with a thirst for power. And the gods, meanwhile, were losing their magic power, and the Earth began to resonate with Nibiru more and more. The world of the gods began to rot from the inside. The Atlantean technologies that were given to them changed the sound of the Earth, and created a telepathic resonance of their collective mind with Nibiru.This responded to the sound of the entire solar system, and increased the attraction of this planet. People have a reminder of this technology in the legend - the Atlas that holds the Earth.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The next time a new star appeared in the sky, the invasion began. The artificial electromagnetic field of Nibiru lit up with a radiance in the metal ionosphere, and with its crushing frequencies penetrated the consciousness of the Atlanteans, sowing horror on Earth. In fact, Nibiru had to perform a gravitational maneuver, which is what ordinary spaceships do. She had to go near the Earth, between her and the Sun in order to slow down and stay in the solar system. And the technology of telepathic resonance with other planets made it possible to some extent influence the course in order to follow the desired trajectory. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When Nibiru approached the Earth, clouds covered the sky. A gale of wind rose, giant waves from the ocean hit Atlantis, and an earthquake began.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And then what happened usually happens in experiments with static electricity - attraction and repulsion. Nibiru did not touch the Earth in the literal sense. Planets "crashed" through their fields. The electrified golden tail of dust, reaching for Nibiru, the tail of a dragon, began to attract Earth. There was a breakdown between the planets, the flow of static electricity began. And from the lead clouds on Atlantis, a huge lightning collapsed, together with huge waves sending it into oblivion. And Nibiru flew further along its new, somewhat modified, still as long orbit, leaving the solar system. But the blow dealt by this maneuver was sudden and destructive. He destroyed the civilization of the gods. What was still left of them, the nuclear explosions were turned into ruins before Nibiru again disappeared behind the cover of interstellar darkness.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dragons could do a lot since they now had a moon. They created a frequency barrier in the Earth‚Äôs field, because of which the earth gods ceased to remember past lives, and people forgot that they were like gods, and part of their DNA turned into garbage. People were left with a minimum so that they could survive and work, and as soon as they reached the age of awareness, they began to die slowly. Those who were able to resist this gradually found themselves in the prison of death - their bodies were turned into mummies, and surrounded by the illusion of life, so that they could not break out of the shackles of their previous incarnation and be born again. When Nibiru returned the next time, there were only fragments of the greatness of the gods on Earth, and half-wild people reigning among them, deprived of memory and knowledge. Only in a few cities did people still remember the old days, but nuclear explosions erased that memory.All that remained of the people was the myths about Sodom, Gomorrah, and the Tower of Babel.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When everything old was swept away, a new world order began to be built on its machines - a second attempt to attract Nibiru. A new order had to be built so that people did not know who rules them from the other world, and did not remember that they are gods. But so that their thoughts could create a resonance, reflected in the ionosphere and responding throughout the planet, they created a god for them, an embodiment of Nibiru with many names. This happened 5781 years ago, and was considered to be the creation of the world.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The new God also wanted to receive psychic energy from people like the old ones, but his appetites were different. He divided and pitted people in wars, and demanded sacrifices. Cruelty and fear gave the dragons strength in the same way that dog fighting evokes an emotional upsurge in humans. They spread fear all over the planet because it was the right frequency of resonance. Being far from the light, Nibiru resonated with him. Cruelty and hatred reigned on Earth, fear began to sound in its aura, creating an ever-increasing connection of the planet with Nibiru. People, however, were no longer aware that emotions are the energy with which their thoughts are embodied in reality. This knowledge was hidden from them forever.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From time to time on Earth, strong gods were born from those that were before. They were born without a memory of who they are, but their strength led them to this knowledge, and they passed it on to people, so that they would know too. But whenever this knowledge appeared on Earth, dragons exterminated it, changed it, and turned it into a religion, gaining power over it. Once, when a new star lit up again on the earth‚Äôs sky, giving a reference point to a new reckoning after 3,700 years, a very strong god was born. The knowledge given to them was so great that it became indestructible. But the blindness of people allowed them to take possession, and this knowledge, hundreds of years later, became the most important religion of worship of Nibiru. In order for people to attract this planet, not knowing about it, they were given its description, encrypted in numbers and abstract images. And a sequence of events was given as a prophecy,so that they translate it into reality with their thoughts.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The preachers of this religion were given secret knowledge, the essence of which they did not know. This was knowledge of emitters, gathering in which and entering resonance, people could act on the ionosphere. By visualizing the encrypted image of God, and its inevitable second coming, people gave their energy to dragons, and attracting Nibiru. And the image of a strong god who was crucified was always before their eyes, so that they remember how to not do it. This new faith spread throughout the earth, and was central to the rulers. Her servants for many centuries destroyed the gene pool of all who could still see the secret world, and knew about telepathy. They uprooted knowledge that could undermine faith in the new god, and planted those that were profitable. Over time, this belief has ceased to resonate with the minds of people, as they have new knowledge about the world,and then science replaced it. She also defended a new faith, eliminated everything that people do not need to know, and allowed to develop what was needed to implement the plan. People were allowed to build an information network, and rulers possessed by power were given control of the human mind through electronic speaking images that everyone worshiped in multi-story temples. Seeing the pain of others in electronic images, experiencing fear of their death, and visualizing the salvation offered by them, people sacrificed to the new electronic god. And the prophets of this god showed them the way.it was given to control the human mind through electronic speaking images that everyone worshiped in multi-story temples. Seeing the pain of others in electronic images, experiencing fear of their death, and visualizing the salvation offered by them, people sacrificed to the new electronic god. And the prophets of this god showed them the way.it was given to control the human mind through electronic speaking images that everyone worshiped in multi-story temples. Seeing the pain of others in electronic images, experiencing fear of their death, and visualizing the salvation offered by them, people sacrificed to the new electronic god. And the prophets of this god showed them the way.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But people were not aware of the true capabilities of the information network available to those who owned telepathy, and could inspire thoughts. And people did not know about the mighty power that their thoughts create, resonating with their planet. Surrounding the Earth with a sphere of metal debris of space debris and clouds reflecting the Sun, creating an electronic network that changed the sound of the planet, they created a space engine that uses the power of their thoughts. People have turned the Earth into a cyborg. But at the same time, no one ever knew the true purpose and appearance of those whom he serves, although he was always known to everyone.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The best deception is half-truth, and the most hidden secret is that which is in sight. Teaching people to laugh at the truth, while visualizing their slavery, they were impudently exposed to show secret plans in the guise of silly stories and films. People created an electronic prison for themselves, not knowing what it is and who controls it from outer space. Manipulating the minds of people, the secret invaders led them to a development course that completely divided them in self-isolation in order to finally establish the power of the beast. To this end, a global threat has been created for people, in the fear of which they themselves will imprison themselves in the prison of the psychotronic hell created by their own hands. Irradiated by zombie radiation, drugged by chemicals and lack of oxygen due to the destruction of forests, intimidated by artificially played nuclear wars, viruses and alien pseudo-intrusions,people hiding in the tight concrete boxes of generators, studded with emitters, and isolated from the Sun, people will be happy to accept virtual reality. And by connecting to it through a chip implanted in the head, the emitter from which you can no longer get rid of, and without which it will be impossible to live in modern society, people will be driven into a mousetrap. After the exit from the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãclosed, and the power of the police world finally passes to the robots controlled from Nibiru via the Internet, the trap will shut. And then the only possible way out of it will be death. But death from destructive brain irradiation will not take long to wait in a world where the disappearance of a person can be considered a change of account for those who behave incorrectly. Special,if for the owners of this world a person in the simplest sense is nothing more than a source of food. The only goal, meaning and way of life of people connected to wires in such a world will be the production of the psychic energy of fear, and the visualization of monstrous designs, under the strict control of the electronic god. Perhaps by that time the Sun will no longer shine and the Earth will replenish the fleet of worlds of darkness, becoming the next embodiment of technoad.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But the gods did not leave this planet. They watch her with interest, because for them life is not a game. For people, the game is fair in that they decide how to act and which path to choose, because it is useful for their own development. The solar system does not just fly in a circle, it evolves along with those who live in it, and this evolution is cyclical. Each time, making an acceleration jump, increasing and decreasing the frequency of vibrations, and noting this with periods of warming and cooling, the solar system is at a new level of evolution. Once such a leap will lead to the physical death of the Sun, and its degeneration into a new stellar body. By accumulating energy, the spring of the solar system will expand as muchthat the Sun scatters its entire mass with a giant explosion and makes a leap to a new level of existence in the form of a small white star - its next shell.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The structure of the spiral of the galaxy is such that the consciousness, developing in it, moves to the central Sun - the main source of light and energy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Planets and stars along this path are born and die millions of times, they are nothing more than bubbles in a giant vortex. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the development of consciousness traveling from the hellish worlds of darkness of the outskirts of the galaxy to the central light continues. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the circumstances that arose in the solar system along this path are just another stage of development before a new evolutionary leap. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People, as well as the astronauts who are preparing for the journey, must survive the overload, then to feel weightlessness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And for this, they must remember that they are the pilots of this ship called Earth, and are responsible for where it flies.</font></font></div>
