</i><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On January 25, 1979, in the city of Flat Rock (Michigan, USA), Robert Williams, a 25-year-old Ford warehouse employee, was instructed to retrieve parts stored in a huge rack, which was also serviced by a five-level truck. It was developed by Litton Industries to move blanks in stock. Part of the machine consisted of monophonic vehicles for transportation - carts with rubber wheels equipped with mechanical manipulators for moving blanks. Williams was sent to do a job that the robot could not handle - some details were left without the attention of the machine. The worker climbed to the third level of the rack and began to carry out the task. In the meantime, one of the carts appeared here, which immediately killed the worker, who did not notice her approach, with a blow from the manipulator.Williams' body remained on the shelf for half an hour until the workers found him. The robot routinely continued to move the blanks. Relatives of the worker sued $ 10 million in damage, and Williams, not even learning about it, went down in history as the first victim of the robot.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is symbolic that the death of Williams happened on the anniversary of the premiere of Karel Chapek‚Äôs play ‚ÄúRossum Universal Robots‚Äù, which took place in 1921. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was this work that gave us the concept of "robot", as well as the first description of the total destruction of humanity by rebel machines. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, to call the death of Robert Williams a murder would mean a great exaggeration, because the factory machine did not have the main ‚Äúqualifying symptom‚Äù of intentional murder - the motive. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And even in July 2016, when a police robot with explosives was used to eliminate a criminal in Dallas (Texas, USA), the actions of the machine were still led by a man.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do robots often harm humans?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Although all robots, with the exception of the military, are designed so that none of Azimov‚Äôs rules are violated, victims cannot be completely avoided. Are there many of them? The statistics of dramatic incidents with robots cannot be called extensive, although injuries and even murders involving machines occur regularly. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to a study by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), industrial robots caused at least 33 deaths and injuries in the workplace in that country over 30 years. However, there are more gloomy data. In 2013, German insurance companies calculated that about 100 incidents involving industrial robots occur in Germany every year.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In an earlier study in 1987, which covered enterprises from the USA, Germany, Sweden and Japan, it was found out exactly how robots injured workers: in 56% of cases they inflicted penetrating wounds, in 44% - blows. Most accidents were caused by poor organization of the workplace (20 of the 32 incidents analyzed), and human errors provoked only 13 unpleasant situations.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are statistics about the unsuccessful use of robots in individual areas of their application. For example, as doctors say, medical cobots ‚Äúopened their cemetery‚Äù: in 2013, a team of scientists analyzed statistics from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and found that since 2000 In 2013, during surgical operations assisted by robots, 144 deaths, 1,391 injuries and 8 thousand device malfunctions occurred. Among them, two deaths and 52 injuries were caused by spontaneous shutdown of the robot during an operation or in the wrong movement. One death and 119 injuries occurred due to the fact that the elements of the robot or the equipment held by it fell on the patient.</font></font><br>

<h3>   ?</h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main and almost philosophical problem: robots do not recognize themselves as part of the world, and therefore, can be dangerous to others. However, if 20-40 years ago the robot was an electromechanical machine with a very limited range of repetitive tasks, and it could literally be "kept in a cage", that is, limited access to it so that it would not harm anyone by accident, today the situation is changing. In order for robots to replace individual workers or supplement their capabilities with their own, machines have to be released from cages. For one conveyor, two sorters can work simultaneously - live and mechanical. Moreover, robots become multi-tasking, for which they need to move around the workshop. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Accordingly, a single working space of a person and a machine is formed, in which anything can happen.</font></font><br>
<br>

<li> ,          ;</li>
<li>,    .</li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
What provokes these threats? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the observations of OSHA experts, many incidents involving robots do not occur under normal operating conditions, but in emergency situations, for example, during reprogramming, maintenance, repair, testing, tuning or adjustment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The following are external factors that are not dependent on the person - natural or technical, say, a power failure. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In total, it is customary to identify seven main reasons for robots getting out of control:</font></font></b><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">control errors, that is, errors in the control system or software, which leads to unstable behavior or an increase in the dangerous energy potential of the machine;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unauthorized access - violation by an untrained specialist of a security zone near the machine; </font></font></li>

<li>         ,        ; </li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">human factor: programming errors, pairing, control, safety violations. </font></font></li>
</ol><br>

Although the promoter was in the wrong place, the driver of the car who turned off the autopilot was to blame. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Source: Promobot YouTube Channel</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Most often, emergency situations arise either when the human robot interferes with the work of the robot, or due to environmental changes that the mechanical worker cannot respond to. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What technologies can prevent this?</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What technologies ensure the safety of robots?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Three key skills are made a safe employee of the robot: 1) controlled stop, 2) control of speed and separation of zones, 3) limitation of power and force. Explain these concepts. </font></font><br>
<br>
<i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safety-rated Monitored Stop (SMS) A</font></font><br>
</b></i><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
controlled stop of the robot occurs as soon as a person is in a certain area near the machine, say, to replace equipment, adjust, adjust or other actions directly with the robot. In this case, the power supply continues, and the robot automatically goes into idle mode. As soon as the operator leaves the control zone, the robot resumes work operations without additional commands.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To measure the distance from the robot to a person (or other interference), remoteness sensors of various types (optical, sound, etc.) are used, which determine the distance to the object, sending a signal and receiving a response. To ensure maximum safety, the sensors have two parallel systems for transmitting and processing signals about the appearance of interference in a given zone. The signals arrive in two different modules in the robot controller and are processed separately, with different algorithms. Then they go through cross-validation. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Accordingly, if one of the channels fails for any reason, the robot will still stop.</font></font><br>
<br>

<br>
<i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand Separation Monitoring (SSM)</font></font><br>
</b></i><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This more sophisticated security technology involves changing the behavior of a robot when a person is in a specific area near a machine ‚Äî for example, slowing down a robot.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Technically, this happens like this: a machine continuously measures the position and speed of an object in the field of visibility. SSM can be implemented in both static and dynamic conditions. The key to this is the technology of recognition of surrounding objects. In particular, Toshiba object recognition technology is applicable for SSM. Initially, we developed it to solve problems with warehouse robots, which were supposed to learn how to handle parcels, including different sizes, colors, weights and shapes. If a robot needs to see what it captures, then why not learn how to recognize colleagues, including humans? Toshiba's recognition technology is based on the use of two cameras, an RGB camera and a 3D camera. Combining the pictures they received, the robot can determine the position of the object in space and the direction of its movement.</font></font><br>
<br>
<i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Power and Force-Limited (PFL)</font></font><br>
</b></i><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
This is one of the most commonly used technologies that avoids harm to people when they come in contact with people. It involves the use of various techniques, including force-sensing sensors. It converts the measured components of the force and moment vectors into signals suitable for processing by a robot that ‚Äútouches‚Äù certain objects. For example, such sensors are mounted on the brackets of Toshiba robots, which sort out different types of packages, including fragile ones. Before taking the package, the robot ‚Äúfeels‚Äù it and the sensor determines which object the machine deals with in shape, elasticity, size. Based on the data obtained, the robot selects the clamping force and the speed of handling the object.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What technologies will make the robot safer in the future?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Future industrial robots, unlike their predecessors, which were only capable of rhythmic repetition of a limited range of tasks, will interact with a changing environment and humans. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order for the robot to be able to do this and perform atypical tasks, it must, to one degree or another, master the basic human skills, in particular, the ability to listen. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
More recently, Toshiba introduced a new technology for speech recognition based on artificial intelligence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the first such development in the world: any robot or simple electronic device will be able to process voice commands without connecting to the Internet and cloud data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, the processing device is integrated into the machine.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, the neural network processes the sound, separating voice commands from extraneous noise. Next, a technique for expanding data in a neural network is used. Data extension is a method of studying small amounts of information, in this case, oral statements. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/l5/2j/gpl52jdnu0h27orkpjyrwsrsj64.png"><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/xl/7_/vvxl7_wtg3q7qjmnoug0xljt9uy.png"><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By randomly assigning zero weight to the connections between the nodes of the neural network, it is possible to generate simulated speech information, as if the speaker spoke differently. Successful identification of people occurs thanks to the training of AI based on samples of their speech, which allows you to recognize specific speakers, even when only a small number of statements are available. Source: Toshiba</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Toshiba has reduced the number of speech patterns required to such an extent that the new technology can recognize the user in just three sentences. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This technology is perfectly </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">suitable</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for robots and kobotov, which need not be wordy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyway, bye. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the future, artificial intelligence will help robots not only hear better, but also see, think and move, which over time will completely eliminate the barriers between human workers and their artificial colleagues.</font></font></div>
