<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sport</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The advice ‚Äúgo in for sports‚Äù often sounds along with many problems: posture, obesity, migraines, self-esteem, burnout - sports help a lot in very different cases. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And you don‚Äôt even have to specify what kind of sport we are talking about. Usually, those who have said and heard have the same meaning by the word ‚Äúsport‚Äù - this is some kind of healthy physical activity that is healthy for them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It remains only to choose the appropriate sport - bringing more benefits and less harm. To not expensive, not far from home, according to strength and personal preferences. According to the recommendations of those who tried and examples of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">success</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I want to draw attention to the fact that the mentioned choice of a sport is part of a problem closely related to the use of a popular but vague term.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I want to suggest thinking about the opportunity to improve what we do in swimming pools, fitness clubs, exercise machines, rocking chairs, on treadmills, workout areas and at home. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Spoiler: The article contains an invitation for reflection. Questions are voiced, a direction for new thoughts is suggested, not ready-made answers. There is no motivating advertisement for the next training methodology. If you want to find out another recipe for health that helped someone, then you need other articles, there are many. Those who want to skip the discussion can immediately </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">jump to the results</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Disclaimer: Some sports are unambiguously and undeniably more useful than an excessively sedentary lifestyle. The author does not offer anywhere to give up sports, fitness and other workouts, which undoubtedly bring health benefits.</font></font><br>
<br>
<a name="habracut"></a><a name="12"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The word ‚Äúsport‚Äù is common, there is no need to consult the dictionary. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I close my eyes, mentally pronounce the word ‚Äúsport‚Äù and look at associations: ski jumping from the ski jump, judges with raised grades, handing out medals, boxing match, corns ripped off a horizontal bar, pain from fittings for several days ... Pictures add up to a kind of screensavers that spin on TV in front of reports from the next Olympics. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Everyone has their own associations, yes. Are there many who have the word ‚Äúsport‚Äù directly associated with pictures of a simply healthy life?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A healthy life is by no means a process of earning health. Health refers to the terms of the absence of the opposite, which denote not the essence, but the absence of opposite essences. Health in itself cannot be depicted in the figure. With a healthy life, sores and diseases do not prevent you from doing something important, useful, interesting. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A simple healthy life looks too simple, so sports advertisements instead of health offer other pictures: effort, biceps, press, twine, attention of the opposite sex, self-confidence - different symbols of overcoming and achievements. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In sports advertising, a healthy body has lost its value and has become a tool to achieve any other goals. The tool has become a commodity. To obtain which you need to buy other goods.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Advertising pictures chosen by the business for business purposes are poorly associated with those who need to fix the shaky health. If someone wants to get out of the pit, he is motivated by photos of climbers on top of the mountain. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, sports are good for health, but only if you compare sports and snacks on the couch in front of the TV. Definitely, moderate exercise in certain sports is more beneficial than pronounced inactivity. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, sports are not only healthy sumo, rugby and motorcycle races, but also poker, network battles in Starcraft, ferrets in trousers and fast-eating hot dogs. There is even a sport in the square - a tote, competition for competitions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Sports too often intersect with </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">professional injuries</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, a career for children and a threshold for lovers. </font></font><br>
<br>
<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sport</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is a sight, a way of dumping emotions, fun, game, competition, gambling and hundreds of types of business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A very vague term, under which there are too many dissimilar entities besides ‚Äúgood for health in moderate doses‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the term fits poorly, then attempts to find another are not prohibited.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Training</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Several times I heard professional athletes in gyms correcting fans: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Hello, yes, I am doing sports now ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - No, you are not doing sports here, do not confuse. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not an original, even an old idea: it is difficult to achieve success if you do not understand what exactly you are doing. The better you understand, the higher the effectiveness of the classes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In gyms, we solve some completely understandable tasks: rehabilitation after an illness, preventive maintenance of health, gaining beauty, peace, vitality, good self-esteem ... </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We achieve what we want by different methods: stretching, strengthening, pumping, drying and so on. Many recommendations and training programs can be found on the Internet and in person with professional trainers. It remains only to choose.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the neighborhood with the term ‚Äúsport‚Äù, others have long existed: exercise, warm-up, training, exercises. More accurate, better suited to specific situations. Accuracy makes them small and therefore not interesting for business. However, if someone goes in for sports for himself, and not for business, then he can afford to take a closer look at these other terms. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Increasingly, the word ‚Äúfitness‚Äù is used instead of the word ‚Äúsport,‚Äù which is more focused on gaining health, but is still limited to training. You can find a nutritionist in some fitness centers, but I did not find in the fitness centers quality lessons on gaining a healthy walk, posture, rest, sleep, breathing - on developing everyday skills that undoubtedly relate to the topic of health.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Training is needed to correct, compensate, strengthen what does not work out properly in the process of ordinary life. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A sign of insufficient training - skipping classes in the fitness center leads to a deterioration in well-being. If skipping a workout feels unpleasant, then this indicates not so much the benefit of the workout as the fact that during the workouts the consequences of a problem are habitually eliminated, and not the problem itself. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If training does not develop a useful skill for everyday life, if it has become a compensatory practice, then there is a dependence on training, and they can safely be called exercise.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to charging, warm-ups are useful - to pull muscles, to work with something that has not been used for a long time. A warmed up and revived body, prepared for loads, can be seated in a car or at a computer so that you can continue to do your main activity while still. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In gyms, we do not so much competition, as training. We train individual parts or functions of the body that we consider to be the most in need of improvement. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Training inherited another drawback of ‚Äúsports‚Äù - a narrow focus. Even choosing sports all-around, we try to achieve success in the chosen framework.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Hearing the advice ‚Äúgo in for sports‚Äù, we begin to look for some specific occupation - the rocking chair is closer, the pool is easier, I don‚Äôt want to run along the freeway, I need a forest for a bike, you can hang up a horizontal bar at home, beautiful girls use yoga, wise philosophy, boxing can be useful on the street ... One or several directions are selected according to recommendations, convenience, likes. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Training becomes self-sufficient, we select a tool for training - a place, a simulator, a program of approaches. And, while training, we train something for some purpose - to become more beautiful, stronger, more resilient, calmer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To achieve something good. Or to avoid something bad. Looking at what today is listed in the values ‚Äã‚Äãand recommendations.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The phrase ‚Äúyou need to train everything‚Äù sounds scary - I don‚Äôt have enough time, money, desire. Therefore, I will only train something that needs training most. Or I‚Äôll take a group of several directions - for strength, speed, endurance, add cardio and stretching. What else was recommended there? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With the help of a trainer, I‚Äôll make up a set of exercises that I will follow for a while, waiting for some results. I will measure progress in seconds, kilometers, kilograms, and the number of repetitions. And to hope that some portion of health, confidence and beauty will become a side effect. The popularity of the sport is based on side effects.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The choice of direction for training is given more attention than the training itself. Money, time, effort are invested in training, but not the head, so the articles ‚Äúwhat kind of music is suitable for training‚Äù appear after the articles ‚Äúwhich sport to choose for sedentary work‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In popularity, those types of fitness that offer not just training, but also entertainment, win. It is believed that during training it is necessary to distract the head with something external, otherwise it begins to toil from idleness. And gamification is in fashion.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The training inherited from the sport not only the desire for the game, but also the need to compete - to overcome oneself and enjoy the external symbols of victory. Tired, do not want to? Ignore, the effort is important, you have to reach the drawn finish line. We repeat ‚Äúno gain without pain‚Äù, ‚Äúbeauty requires sacrifice‚Äù and other fashionable slogans for motivation in battle against a part of yourself. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Perhaps at the same time, the feet begin to get tired, some veins swell, the back begins to creak in a dozen years - these are trifles, we can write off age, genes, stresses. And we plan to strengthen the next muscle group. Or change the coach to a more knowledgeable one. Immediately after the next series of disputes of trainers about the futility or </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">trauma of</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> individual exercises </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ends </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When choosing a direction, you can meet with the Feldenkrais method, the Hannah method and other similar schools - this is not a sport, not yoga, not qigong, but new directions, based on body knowledge, not on competitions and traditions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, these schools, quite respected by me, still have the same old drawback - they did not have time to develop to the possibility of independent use. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Schools require classes with a teacher to identify errors and receive recommendations on how to correct what is found.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Physical Education</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If I want to train everything, and not follow the magic of the recommended sets of exercises, if I want to understand what I am doing, then the term ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">physical education</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">is suitable for me </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Between folk culture, production culture and physical culture is common. Any culture is a set of knowledge and skills. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An example of physical education is brushing your teeth, the benefits and rules of which are told not by trainers, but by dentists. But dentists will not talk about the rules of working the muscles of the temporomandibular joint when chewing, because the cheeks go beyond dentistry. Where to find a physical education specialist in general? This was not a rhetorical question.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We remember the word "physical education" from the time of school, where under the guise of physical education they gave everything except physical education, simultaneously discouraging interest in development. At school lessons, we received exercises and tests - this is not gaining knowledge and not developing skills. And it is unlikely that the next generation will escape this trap, the education industry will not fix bugs at all quickly, and the backlog is long. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Physical education is compromised, it is not a fashionable novelty, it is not aimed at selling goods, textbooks contain norms instead of principles, the role of a teacher is reduced to the work of a coach.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, the curriculum contains beautiful phrases like ‚Äúthe ability to follow socially significant ideas about a healthy lifestyle,‚Äù but all this philosophical and philosophical wealth does not cause interest among adolescents. Only the simplest is remembered about a healthy lifestyle: do not drink, do not smoke, play sports. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, teaching materials for physical education teachers contain many brilliant words like ‚Äúto instill‚Äù, ‚Äúform‚Äù and ‚Äúcontribute to the development of skills‚Äù, but remember the school - did you learn to sleep and walk properly?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I searched and looked at modern textbooks on physical education, the quality has improved markedly over the past decade: there are fascinating facts for children, there are interspersed anatomy, complexes of exercises are developing, motivating calls softened. However, it seems that physical education for textbook compilers is no different from other school subjects - textbooks offer information, but I was looking for a basis for building a culture. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Perhaps some readers were lucky to meet a real physical education teacher. I attended five schools and watched three more schools as a parent, but I was out of luck. The physical education lessons I know did not bring so much knowledge and skills. And in no way intersected with the lessons of anatomy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Breathing - calls ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù and ‚Äúnot to part‚Äù, without a story about the mechanism. Posture - the rules ‚Äúkeep it flat‚Äù and ‚Äútake breaks‚Äù, without telling about the reasons leading to distortions. The gait comes down to the rules of running - the orders ‚Äúdo not put your feet‚Äù, ‚Äúdo not jump out‚Äù, ‚Äúdo not stick the heel‚Äù, ‚Äústretch before the loads‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If education comes down to training, then I doubt the ideality of the current state of things, I see an opportunity to find ways to correct and improve. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I do a picture search for the word ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">physical education</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄùAnd I get a lot of images with children, plus a little with the elderly (who can‚Äôt do without exercise therapy anymore). The obvious conclusion is that in our time physical education is not associated with adults, it is not necessary for adults, it is only necessary for the education of young people and occasionally for treatment. An unobvious conclusion is that if a parenting product disappears without a trace after school, then parenting failed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To stop playing sports in the gym and begin to engage in physical education, you need to get headphones with music or foreign language lessons from your ears and focus on your body. Invest not only time and calories, but also attention. Start observing, studying, comprehending and correcting what you are doing. Do not mechanically carry out a program compiled by specialists, but acquire knowledge and develop skills for life outside the gym or stadium.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I‚Äôll take the study of a foreign language for analogy. The trap is hidden in the word ‚Äústudy‚Äù - speech, as it were, boils down to obtaining information and assimilating knowledge. In fact, the study hides the development of completely different reading, writing, listening and pronunciation skills. Hard-working students rely on the quality of courses and teachers, although skills can only be created inside their own head by the efforts of its owner. Knowledge of a foreign language does not boil down to knowledge and performing exercises. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the one hand, lazy. After all, I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe name of the profession‚Äù, ‚Äúposition in the family‚Äù and ‚Äúthe name of the hobby‚Äù, I have something to study besides anatomy with physiology, I pay doctors and coaches for this special knowledge, it was not in vain that I came up with specialization.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
On the other hand, the body and mind are the main tools in life. A problem with any of these tools complicates any work. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We pay a lot of attention to working tools: languages, frameworks, soft-skills ... And the body - it will somehow repair itself, patched up and fixed, won't it? The rhetorical question, obviously, is not always the case. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Not so, if you look at the abundance of posts on forums and magazines about health problems, and the abundance of generously distributed tips that sometimes help, yes, but not for everyone and not always.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Take a look at the children - they don‚Äôt need to force themselves to run, unlike most adults who run only when absolutely necessary, according to the doctor‚Äôs recommendations, under the influence of fashion, but very rarely just out of a desire to go for a run. If by the age of twenty years the desire to run and jump disappears, then this means that problems arise already by the age of twenty, they simply are not yet visible in the diagnoses, although the body is already in full use of the margin of safety. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Hypodynamia, which is the cause of many diseases, in turn, has a reason - unwillingness to actively move. What kind of sport eliminates the cause of physical inactivity?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Doctors certainly benefit, especially in crisis situations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Coaches are beneficial, of course, especially in preventing mistakes, saving time, and improving efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in everyday life, the view from the inside of the body sees more than the view from the outside. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The owner is responsible for the state of the body, and hourly, third-party assistants can only occasionally help.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Massage</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Doctors and trainers often recommend being like a massage. For example, an ophthalmologist may advise collar massage, a Thai boxing trainer may advise correcting lower back problems before continuing training. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the case of diseases with an unclear cause, massages are quite suitable for maintaining health. On the topic of health, massage therapists have long settled a niche between doctors and trainers. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It‚Äôs no easier to find a good massage therapist than a good doctor or a good trainer. The best on the Internet are not advertised, because they already have an excess of customers, and going to the middle ones is also a lottery. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Near the ‚Äúmassage therapist‚Äù other titles are often present: vertebrologist, osteopath, chiropractor, kinesiologist, physiotherapist, traumatologist, rehabilitologist, neurologist, orthopedist ... Who to choose? </font></font><br>
<br>

Here I made a gross simplification, but I just do not want to go into the details of their philosophy of ‚Äúdialogue with tissues‚Äù. Spurred by unexpected successes, the direction began to develop rapidly, the discoverers, in their enthusiasm, went so far as to deny a significant part of traditional medicine, for which they justly suffered, having received the stigma of unscientific heretics along with anti-vaccines and homeopaths. Osteopaths were so carried away by experiments with non-traditional methods of ‚Äútreatment‚Äù that sometimes their patients with inexcusable lateness ended up in hospitals with real doctors. </font></font><br>

In general, the term has become too collective - if someone invents some kind of myofascial release (Rolfing) or post-isometric relaxation (PIR), then it will be attributed to the manual, although these methods generally do not apply to those accumulated in the neighborhood. If to be coarsened and generalized, today heterogeneous manual therapists offer to stretch the bones and internal organs less, to pay more attention to the state of muscles and fascia. But the manuals do not fit into the framework of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">evidence-based medicine</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and cause controversy about whether therapy is treatment, and whether someone who is not a doctor has the right to treat (not all manuals have a medical education).</font></font><br>

<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kinesiologists</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , who are new, who should somehow be distinguished from the same areas in chiropractic, develop the ideas of </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">biomechanics</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and draw attention to the fact that a motionless sitting or lying patient is not a completely natural living organism. The study of efforts and movements allows you to move forward in the treatment of man. They were also helped by the fact that the fascial chains that have been talked about since the middle of the last century have been </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">confirmed</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">existence, therefore, it is necessary to more comprehensively consider local problems with the musculoskeletal system. Both functional blocks that eliminate osteopaths and trigger points that eliminate manual technicians are not causes of problems, but compensatory reactions of the body, thoughtless removal of which is not always beneficial for the patient. Reasoning looks logical, progressive, scientific terms are abundant, but even kinesiologists are lame in evidence, and dubious vacillations are observed towards too strange experiments, to put it mildly.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Watching the next video from the next manual, sometimes I can hardly resist exclamations like "well, what kind of nonsense does he bear." However, I also have rich experience in communicating with traditional doctors who, without a shadow of a doubt, voiced postulates that are far from any kind of science. Unscientific myths can be found in any head, including mine. The important thing is not who the massage therapist calls himself, but what we gain from him as a result - benefit, harm or nothing.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A doctor‚Äôs diploma is the best we can get today to reduce the likelihood of falling into the hands of a complete layman. If I need to go to a massage therapist, I will look for one and a half education - a traditional diploma in medical specialties, such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rehabilitologist, plus something from a near-medical subject, even the same manual technician or kinesiologist, but with a mandatory check for selected doctor hobbies bioenergy, acupuncture and craniosacrality. And so that magnets do not apply. I‚Äôll look at lymphatic drainage with caution. Perhaps I agree to try taping. But the closer to traditional massage, the better - this is if I am looking for a massage therapist to solve my problems, but do not want to serve as an experimental to advance science.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To choose a good massage therapist, it does not hurt to get acquainted with a thick layer of related information. Health is important, so the choice must be made deliberately. If you choose the right massage therapist, you can relax, calmly invest time and money in anticipation of a useful result, the specialist works ... Do you notice the template? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For this article, the names of the directions are completely unimportant, they are given above only as an example of the same problem, hiding in the complexity and overvaluation of the choice (the problem is choice, Neo). The choice gained value and became like a finishing tape, after which you can relax. This article offers a peek further.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The masseur, no matter who he is, still only eliminates the consequences. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether he really heals or simply exploits the placebo effect - he only helps to correct mistakes, and does not lay the foundation for a healthy life. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Teachers at school, doctors, masseurs, trainers - they do not provide education on which an adult can rely in everyday life.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recipes</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Looking at another successful story about another recipe for gaining health, I often notice a good old plan:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Talk about a personal health problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A prerequisite - the problem must be popular, close to at least a hundred readers.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the problem is serious, then be sure to mention the examination in hospitals with a disappointing result.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When speculating on possible causes, you should generously add scientific terms, it is also useful to add links to scientific articles.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mention a few other recipes that didn't help or didn't work.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Choose your favorite recipe (push-ups, horizontal bar, yoga, diet, bike, swimming, etc.). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A prerequisite - this recipe must be popular, close to at least a hundred readers.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Talk about how the recipe helped make the long-awaited progress.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Give helpful tips or cautions for beginners.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Share plans for the future.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Motivating to wish everyone success in the field of health.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Find a cute KDPV and remove errors from the text. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Publish.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It remains to collect a lot of positive ratings:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Useful - promoting a healthy lifestyle.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Support - well done, that do not give up, hold on there.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Community - I also tried this recipe, we are many.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Empathy - I also have such a problem, I tried other recipes.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Design - written in living language, not dry.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And you can ignore the rare grumbling of the dissatisfied:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Offtopic is actually a technical forum.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rivalry is another recipe more effective and popular.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Design - too many emotions, mistakes in terminology, not enough quantitative indicators of success.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Rereading my article, I see that some paragraphs can be expanded into full-fledged articles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I‚Äôm not interested </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in pattern </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">farming</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, I plan to write articles about migraine, baldness, neck, breathing, eyesight, immunity and something else that seemed interesting and ambiguous to me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In these articles, some recipes will probably be mentioned, as an example or idea. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But my articles will differ from popular samples, because I try to make the main content of the articles a problem for which I have not found a solution, not a magic pill. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I try to voice questions, not answers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Answers and without me the Internet is full:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I, as an authoritative specialist (the list of titles is attached), recommend such and such a way to solve a group of problems.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A digest of popular ways to solve one of the problems.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">News about the invention of a new method.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I can talk a lot about different recipes, but I don‚Äôt want to talk about recipes, because recipes are part of the problem for which I have no solution and which I am trying to formulate here. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Change of working chair and table, sleeping mattress and pillow, dozens of opinions ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Evenings by candlelight and other recipes for getting rid of bad habits, dozens of books ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Evminov‚Äôs board, Yulina‚Äôs swing, TRX loops, anti-gravity hammocks, barefoot, fitball and dozens of traditional gym equipment for halls and apartments ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Dozens of available sports and dances, martial arts and wisdom ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Jogging and Nordic walking, pump and slide, aqua and step aerobics, callanetics, Pilates, body flex, crossfit, stretching ...</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You are not tired of choosing a deliverable recipe? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also choose health gadgets, there are also dozens of solutions there.</font></font><br>
<br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prevention</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When there is a problem with health or external beauty, a person goes to the doctor, the Internet, to the trainer - begins to look for popular recipes to correct the error that has appeared. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the problem has not arisen, then the person loses interest in health issues and begins to earn money, look for a life partner, raise children and neighbors, come up with the meaning of life - he is engaged in other interesting things. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The word "prevention" is known to everyone, but it is so shabby and worn out that it does not attract attention. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And, again, prevention is a recipe for the prevention of specific diseases in advance.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Society requires hygiene, dentists instilled brushing, scientists have proved the benefits of vaccination and the harm of fast food, business and politicians popularize sports - this is the end of prevention, we calmly continue to earn, educate, create and other entertainments. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We are completely dependent on the body, but interest in it arises only in case of breakdowns - is this not a problem? The body is one of the most important tools for life, but how many inhabitants are interested in it when it does not require repair? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some relate to the body‚Äôs safety margin as a fuel reserve - we will replenish it when necessary. Yes, by the middle years health has to be backed up with medicines, but what do you want, everyone lives like that, old age is inevitable, scientists have not yet come up with a pill for </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">prolonging life</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Every day we breathe and eat, fall asleep and wake up, sit, stand and walk - most of us have all these necessary skills formed spontaneously, by themselves, somehow, thanks to nature, we could not bother, neural networks resolved. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yes, they didn‚Äôt solve it perfectly, errors accumulate, the resource is exhausted, but everything can be attributed to genes, age, stress and other pseudo-answers. And when it breaks, you need to contact specialists to fix breakdowns and develop individual functions. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the work of specialists, I see magic. I do not like magic, I prefer knowledge and skills. In the absence of a specialist, understanding does not arise, amateur performance is fraught with the appearance of unpleasant errors (do not self-medicate).</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Trainers help to calculate and correct mistakes in training, but we can‚Äôt turn to trainers every minute of our lives. We need someone who will teach less often to make mistakes with health risks in everyday activities, and not just during treatment and training. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To go through highly specialized training yourself to become a coach is an idea so-so, in terms of cost, it is too far from the original goal of ‚Äújust to be healthy‚Äù. Everyone should at least be able to independently train themselves, but at the same time it is important to strike a balance between extremes ‚Äúrely on specialists in everything‚Äù and ‚Äúbecome a specialist in all spheres of life‚Äù.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you already become a little trainer for yourself, then a wide profile. What is a ‚Äúbroad profile‚Äù in gaining and maintaining health? I don‚Äôt know, an interdisciplinary approach is needed, but I suspect that physical education is somewhere nearby. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I do not want to play sports to eliminate the shortcomings found, choosing a fashionable direction. The direction of classes should depend on knowledge about yourself, and not on statistics of recommendations on the Internet. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I don‚Äôt want to play sports - mindlessly follow ready-made recipes for artificially set achievements and infinitely repair common breakdowns. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I do not need ready-made exercises, but principles that will allow me to come up with exercises as needed. Nobody teaches cats to stretch, cats catch the general principles, feel their body and adapt to the situation.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I want to engage in physical education - to acquire knowledge and skills for everyday life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not have enough textbooks, lectures, seminars on physical education. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If someone is looking for an idea for a search or creativity, then I just talked about one of the possibilities.</font></font><br>
<br>
<a name="24"></a><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Total</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have seen too many discussions like ‚Äúworking while lying down or standing‚Äù, ‚Äúrunning or swimming‚Äù, ‚Äúraising or lowering the monitor‚Äù - dozens of solutions or recipes are moved over, and new ones are added to the list every year. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Usually, I notice in discussions at once several similar interconnected fundamental problems:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The complexity of the choice - the business wants to sell again and again, the person needs the opportunity to choose, ignoring the reasons leads to insufficient decisions.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Self-worthiness of choice - allows you to turn off your head after the finish line and requires you to defend what is chosen.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fight against the consequences - they are more noticeable, so it‚Äôs easier, but there are no resources left to find, eliminate and prevent the causes.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The recipe (one of the possible) to get out of a rut: to notice problems, think about it, take a closer look at physical education. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am not against recipes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If I am against the ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">golden hammer</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù, this does not mean that I am against hammers in principle - I use hammers, including sports. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If I am against ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">magic pills</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù, this does not mean that I am against pills - I use medicines and other achievements of traditional medicine. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A complete sequence of actions when faced with any health problem:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mandatory examination in the hospital to search for possible diseases.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Solving problems discovered - doctors, masseurs and trainers work here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many deservedly popular solutions: exercise therapy, sports, fitness, etc.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Elimination of the causes that lead to problems is a poorly developed direction that goes towards psychology and therefore deserves a separate discussion.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Making the right reflexes for everyday life - there should be the physical education that I'm looking for.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The elimination of problems should be systemic, integrated, covering not only the consequences, but also the causes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Habitual training and attention to physical education are at different levels of decision.</font></font></div>
