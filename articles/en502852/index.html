This is an online conference on engineering practices and processes. We will discuss in detail how to develop without bugs, how to work with legacy, how to ensure that MVP does not become a technical debt, how to choose practices depending on the problem. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But we know that the most good undertakings are broken about the power of habit. You do not need to be a developer in a technology company to experience this. Remember how annoying changes are in the interface of your favorite applications, even if later they turn out to be convenient features.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To come up with a process that will improve the quality of a product is one thing, and implement it in such a way that it really benefits is another. It‚Äôs not enough to say: ‚ÄúGuys, I know how! Do so, so and so. ‚Äù In order to understand what technical tricks can be expected on the path to implementing change, we talked with Dmitry Maslennikov from </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tinkoff</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . And already at the conference Dmitry </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">will tell</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> what needs to be done so that the changes take root in the team.</font></font><br>

<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is the problem with the implementation of changes in general, why is it not enough to say how to do it?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
We constantly have to implement something. Whoever you are, starting from an active team member to a tech team or manager, you have to influence your colleagues all the time so that they do something differently, and often also synchronously. Most often this is done on a hunch, because engineers mainly study technology, nuclear physics, algorithms, mathematics, but very rarely learn how to work with people.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And indeed this sphere is incomprehensible. There are no exact answers: all people are different, everyone has a different background and cultural characteristics. Therefore, it often doesn‚Äôt work out very well.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From my own experience I want to tell you how to implement changes as efficiently as possible. I have a lot of practice, and now I do just that: I force teams to do something differently. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAre we talking not only about processes, but also about tools?‚Äù</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Yes, I include the introduction of tools here. For example, once upon a time I implemented Git. Now this is the mainstream, and there seems to be nothing to introduce here. And once there was SVN, and to implement Git was that still a task. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A tool for me is a broad concept. In my understanding, pair programming or code review are also tools. I also include practices here, because, it seems to me, these are approximately the same thing. A tool is the practice of using this tool.</font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, the introduction of a process such as daily meetings is not very different from the introduction of a development environment? </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Right. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, I promoted environments on Google because it‚Äôs more convenient to write code with them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But when it is more convenient for the developer to use vim and emacs, try to convince him to change the environment. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why do people so dislike change? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And even in those cases when, it would seem, best practices are designed to save time and energy.</font></font></em></strong><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is always resistance - this is a basic principle.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are changes that go easily: on the thumb track. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But sometimes the changes will be just to stop the changes that are on the thumb. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But to jump from one track to another, change direction, it is very difficult. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And this is true in everything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If a person is used to running, then he runs, and try stopping him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the other is used to not running, so try to force him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Both that, and another are changes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Despite the fact that the one who runs regularly, probably without any problems will be able to go in for some other kind of sport and this will be an easy change for him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And for someone who wasn‚Äôt running, an easy change, for example, is to start playing a new video game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it will be very difficult to get the runner to play this game.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I understand the changes in how a task jumps from one path to another.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, changes on the thumb, when people only need to be pushed, are much simpler than changes that significantly change the usual way. But sometimes the latter are needed, and gradually they will not succeed. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The way people in the company respond to innovations, including the culture of the company. For example, in the West quite often it is in the company's culture that all opinions are important and everyone needs to be heard. It really helps change. And in Russia it often happens that when you propose to do something in a new way, a ton of criticism immediately falls upon you. If a person does not know how to withstand criticism, then he simply becomes silent, and no changes occur. In the West, change is usually easier because at least proposals are heard.</font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is it always possible to build an iterative process for introducing changes? And will the movement in small steps only interfere, because it will be easier to slide back to the old order?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Sometimes it‚Äôs very difficult to take a big step right away and you have to break the implementation process into small stages. For example, now we want all teams to automatically and automatically read SLA. I gave them a start-up training, but only the three strongest teams out of eight made the SLA calculation for themselves. It became clear that you need to help teams and first develop tools, give a technique.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Again, it very much depends on the teams that are mastering the new. You can again bring a sporty analogy. If an athlete, a swimmer starts to run, his progress and steps on distances and loads will obviously be greater than that of a person who has not been involved in sports before. There is no point in referring both of them to the same category of ‚Äúnovice runners‚Äù ‚Äîthey have different training. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So in development. If this is a cool team with highly professional engineers, who also have well-developed soft skills, they most likely understand the need for change, and implementing anything will be faster and easier. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When making changes, you need to understand who you work with, which team, how ready it is, what they already know how to do. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who should initiate changes, and who should introduce and maintain? Necessarily the same person?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I believe that everyone who cares, regardless of job level, should initiate the changes.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I highly encourage any innovations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Western companies do this with a new sauce, but our culture has historical roots - rationalization proposals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any employee could make a suggestion, and if it was beneficial, then the employee was encouraged. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If a person is sure that this will be better, he should try to achieve change. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not the fact that it will really be better - everyone is mistaken. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if there is a desire and energy to do this, then you need to try. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And with my report I want to tell you what you need to think about before proceeding. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In order to implement something, is it necessary to have special powers and use the administrative resource?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An administrative resource is simply one of the tools that can also be used sometimes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you use it too often, it will lose power, there will be a lot of discontent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But sometimes you can‚Äôt do without it.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is rather important to note here that in any case, the introduction of changes needs control.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you implement something only in your team, then it‚Äôs easy to control - you immediately see how everything goes. And when the changes are more extensive, control becomes costly, but without it in any way. At least because they will understand incorrectly, they will not apply as intended, and without control it will not even be clear. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I often observe the law "If something can go wrong, then it will go wrong" in action. On the contrary, glimpses when everything went this way are so rare and perceived as a miracle. And normally you need to prepare to control. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Control is not in the sense of administrative endless reports (although sometimes it is). It is necessary to check whether everyone understood that whether everything is done and whether it is done at all. If you do not invest in it, then everything will definitely go wrong.</font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How to track that, for example, colleagues seem to show the fixation of something in a special form, but for themselves, as they wrote in Google docks, they write like that? That is, the proposed tool is used only to report, but not to make it more convenient for ourselves.</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Google Docks win by convenience, and I myself use them with pleasure. But, if necessary, you can replay this convenience with small tricks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A great example of such a trick that imperceptibly allows you to change people's habits, you can peek at Google. When the company wanted their employees to consume less harmful sweets less, they replaced the refrigerators with those in which the lower part of the door was opaque and the upper part transparent. They put juices, plain water and fruits upstairs, and removed all the chocolates and soda so that they also had to bend down. Of course, this worked, and people themselves changed their behavior. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
With working tools, you can also apply such tricks. Google docks are essentially the same refrigerator you don‚Äôt have to bend into: it‚Äôs very easy to fumble, it‚Äôs convenient to edit, etc. This convenience works against the introduction of any new products. But you can apply the same tricks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, now many have begun to work remotely. Almost all of our employees also work remotely, and the question arose of how best to follow them: to understand whether they are busy or whether they are busy. This was not necessary in the office, but it was needed here. We considered different options, and among other things, I suggested writing daily reports. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I suggested a specific format for reports, wrote a small toolkit that this format would then beautifully display, I tried to make it convenient to use. I introduced this practice in teams that I control. I read all the reports at least once a week, gave feedback to everyone, what‚Äôs so, what‚Äôs wrong. And in two weeks the process got into a rut: everyone writes everything, no complaints.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I proposed the same scheme to my superior leader, and he lowered it to other teams, but did not control. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, everyone reinvented their formats, no one began to adhere to a single format, even within the team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to the fact that there were no tools to control the format, moreover, no one complied with any format. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, it didn‚Äôt work for anyone, only my employees continue to write reports, without negative.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It's all about control - it was not in other teams, so nothing happened. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, the control is not to punish for non-compliance, but that I did not care, I gave feedback. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, some of my team even liked this practice, and the rest did not experience any inconvenience and said that it was more convenient than in Jira would make worklovers write.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another favorite example of mine is how we implemented post-mortem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Google postmortem written in google docks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They don‚Äôt need anything else, because post-mortem is essentially a document that is necessary to be convenient to read and fumble, easy to assemble in a directory with links. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We implemented postmortem writing on wikis - in principle, this is about the same. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But everyone was ready to offer something, tell what is inconvenient, and say what needs to be improved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only no one has improved.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this case, in the end, we had to use the administrative resource and push those who disagree. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The administrative resource was that in the event of any major malfunction, the technical director was ready to explain to everyone why post-mortem is important in principle, why in this format, using such tools. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was a serious matter and we took a tough stance.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In some cases, a tough position is indispensable.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Otherwise, there will be a booth, the details will be discussed until everyone gets tired of doing this at all and everyone returns to their usual rut. </font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- It seems that if the changes are significant and greatly change the usual order, then they require effort from all participants in the process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Have to tolerate or is there another way? </font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Almost always have to be patient. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems to me that, therefore, my report will also be useful to those who are the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù of change. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So that they think that everything is not just and that sticks in wheels are not good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I myself used to be like that, but now, when they tell me that something needs to be done differently, I try to first understand why this might be necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And how to help, or at least not to interfere.</font></font><br>
<br>
<strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is it possible that you endure, endure, when at last it will become more convenient or better, but it still doesn‚Äôt become? When is it time to stop and decide that the idea did not work?</font></font></em></strong><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Of course, some changes have to be discarded. For example, Elon Musk has been trying for a long time to create a robotic plant, so that Tesla will collect mainly robots. This went on until all the deadlines were broken. As a result, Musk admitted that he was in a hurry that the technology was not ready yet, and made a little more traditional production.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The specific criteria at which point you need to abandon the changes, in each case their own.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In my opinion, there are interesting cases when it is known for certain that for others it works well. I believe that when there is such data, it means that it will definitely work for you too. Often cultural characteristics are cited as an argument, but I do not like such reasoning. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seems to me that if a person does not like something for religious reasons (in the sense of a fanatical belief in the correctness of certain approaches), then he shows hidden resistance. Then everything will be done so that the idea dies. But if you implement a really useful practice, then time will squeeze.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, I recently watched how quite a bit of time helped radically change my mind. One young employee with foam at the mouth argued that it was convenient for him and his teammates to receive a huge pile of alerts on slack. Allegedly, looking at a board with 1000 events a day allows you to quickly understand what is happening with the system. And we tried to convince him that alerts should not work like that: they should be rare and really important. And for ordinary events there should be a separate board that you can see when you need to read something like logs. We argued for a long time and came to such a compromise: we help to make a board, and he tries to use it for a week. After 2-3 weeks, the one who resisted the most, already convinced his lead with my own arguments. There was only enough time to realize that the proposal was really useful.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, political moments can turn on here: how long to experiment, how much pressure can be put on, what maximum negativity are we ready to go, if any. These are gray areas. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am not talking about such complicated cases. I want to tell you what you should think about when introducing changes to those who have just become a leader. My </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">report</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> will be a good help for those who only yesterday had excellent communication with colleagues, and now his ideas are not very well accepted. There will still be difficulties, but it will be easier to deal with them if you think about the problem points in advance.</font></font><br>
