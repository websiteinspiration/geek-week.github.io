<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
For many years, smart people working on their image, such as ... well, for example, I have endlessly chatted about usability and how important it is to make the software user-friendly. Jacob Nielsen has a </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mathematical formula</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that he will open for you for only $ 122: with it, you can calculate the value of usability. (If the expected value of usability is more than $ 122, you probably have income.) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have a book that you can buy much cheaper. It tells about some principles of developing convenient software, but there is not a word about mathematics, and the price may seem doubtful to you.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In this book, on page 31, I showed an example of what was then the most popular program on Earth - Napster. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the main window of Napster there were buttons for switching between the five screens. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In accordance with the principle of usability, which is called ‚Äúaffordance‚Äù, instead of buttons, it actually should have tabs, which I wanted to demonstrate with this example. </font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Yet Napster was the most popular program on Earth.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In truth, in the early version of the book, I wrote something like "it shows usability is not that important." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You see, writing this in a usability book was pretty weird. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was relieved when the typesetter asked me to shorten this paragraph and deleted this sentence.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But there is some terrible truth in this - at least terrible for the user interface specialists: an application that does something good that people really need can be hopelessly inconvenient, and it will still be a hit. And vice versa: the application may be the most convenient application in the world, but if it does not give anything that people need, it will fail. That is why consultants on the user interface are constantly defending their positions, developing incredible return on investment formulas for their return, which customers will receive from their usability project for $ 75,000. Usability is perceived as something "optional", and the most frightening, which in most cases is. In most cases. The usability consultant will not be able to give the CNN website anything. I'll take a chance and saythat there‚Äôs not a single content-based website on the Internet that can make a profit of at least one dollar by increasing usability, because content-based websites (that is, sites that are not yet applications) are already already very easy to use.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My current goal is not to whine that usability is not important ... Usability is very important if we consider it as half measures, and there are many examples of how poor usability makes airplanes fall, brings hunger, pestilence, etc. .d. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My goal today is to talk about the next level of software development problems that need to be solved after you have made the right interface: designing a social interface. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I guess I should explain what I mean. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the 1980s, when usability was "invented", the whole point of software was the interaction of a computer with a person. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A lot of software is still this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the Internet has brought us a new kind of software: software based on human-human interaction.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Forums </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Social network. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Internet ads. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh yes, and email too. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is all software that mediates between people, not between a person and a computer. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you write software that serves as an interaction between people, then after you bring usability to mind, you will also have to take care of the social interface. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the social interface is much more important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The best user interface in the world will not save software with a poor social interface. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The best way to illustrate this is to give some examples of unsuccessful and successful interfaces.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A few examples</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First, an example of a bad social interface. Every week I get an email from someone I‚Äôm hearing about for the first time asking me to join his / her social network. Usually I have no idea who this person is, so I'm a little angry and delete the message. Someone explained to me why this is happening: one of these companies engaged in the development of software for social networks has an application that looks through the email address book and sends out letters asking to join all the contacts in it. Now add a feature to this application that allows some mail programs to add each sender of incoming messages to the contacts. And also a program that, when someone subscribes to the Joel on Software site newsletter, automatically sends a confirmation letter asking ifDoes this someone really want to subscribe. And voila: all kinds of strangers to me use software that involuntarily sends me a request to confirm that I am their friend. Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter, but no, I'm not going to introduce you to Bill Gates. I currently have a policy of not joining any of these social networks, because they seem to me to be ardent opponents of how human social networks should work.how human social networks should work.how human social networks should work.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now let's look at a successful social interface. It‚Äôs easier for many people to communicate through correspondence than face to face. Teenagers are shy. Using SMS to mobile phones, they are more likely to invite each other on a date. This type of software was so successful socially that it radically improved the personal lives of millions of people (or at least their social life). Although text messaging has a terrible user interface, it has become extremely popular among teens. The irony is that every mobile phone already has a much more convenient user interface for communication between people: a smart thing called ‚Äúphone calls‚Äù. You dial the number, and after that, everything you say will be able to hear your interlocutor, and vice versa. So simple.But in some circles, calls are not as popular as this inconvenient system, because of which you break your fingers by typing long lines of numbers, just to say "you're sexy." Because this line of numbers will help you go on a date, and you will never have the courage to say ‚Äúyou're sexy‚Äù with your mouth.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another example of a successful social interface is Ebay. When I first heard about Ebay, I said: ‚ÄúBullshit! This will not work. "Nobody will send money to some random person whom he has encountered on the Internet, in the hope that this person will kindly send him some goods‚Äù. Many thought so. And we were all wrong. No, no and NO. Ebay made a big bet on the cultural anthropology of man and won. The great thing about ebay is that it was a huge success precisely because at the time it seemed like a terrible idea and no one else tried to do the same until ebay entered the network algorithms and won the pioneer advantage.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In addition to examples of the absolute success and failure of social software, there are side effects of social software. The way that social software behaves is largely determined by the type of developing community. Usenet clients have a big-R command that is used to reply to a message while quoting the original message with these elegant "&gt;" in the left column. The early news readers were not interconnected, so if you wanted to coherently respond to someone‚Äôs point of view, you had to quote them using the big-R function. This led to a particular Usenet-style response: line by line digging into the details. This is fun for someone who is digging, but not for someone who will read it later. (Incidentally, political bloggers, newcomers to the Internet, reinvented this technique, thinking that they were discovering something fun and new,and called it fisking for reasons that I won‚Äôt go into. Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs nothing dirty behind this.) Although people have been debating for centuries, the tiny feature of the software has created a whole new style of discussion.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Small changes in the software can significantly affect how the software achieves or does not achieve its social goals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dana Boyd criticized social media in an Autistic Social Software article, condemning the current version of this software for making people autistic:</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúConsider the recent surge in interest in articulated social networks such as Friendster, Tribe, LinkedIn, Orkut and the like. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These technologies are trying to formalize how people should build and manage their relationships. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They imply that you can value your friends. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In some cases, they procedurally determine how people can interact with new friends by offering a comprehensive algorithm by which you can connect with other people.</font></font><br>
<br>
  , ,   ,      ,   ,   ,       .    ,      ,     ,          -  .  , ,  ,     ,     ,     .  ,    ,      ?   ,           ?¬ª</blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When software implements a social interface, ignoring cultural anthropology, it looks weird, ridiculous, and generally doesn't work very well.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Social Software Design</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let me give you an example of designing a social interface. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose your user does what he shouldn‚Äôt do. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to the correct design of usability, you must explain to the user what he did wrong, and tell how to fix it. Usability consultants promote this under the brand name ‚ÄúProtective Design‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And that would be too naive if you are working on social software. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Suppose a user is mistaken by posting Viagra ads on a forum. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
You tell them: ‚ÄúSorry, Viagra is not a good topic. Your post has been declined. ‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Do you know what they will do? They will advertise V1agra. (Either that or they will start a long boring discussion about censorship and the First Amendment.)</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When designing a social interface, you must consider sociology and anthropology. In society, there are freeloaders, scammers and other bad people. If we are talking about social software, then there will be people who try to use the software for their own benefit to the detriment of the rest of the forum participants. If this is not kept under control, this will lead to what economists call the ‚Äútragedy of the communities.‚Äù </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
While the goal of user interface design is to help the user succeed, the goal of the social interface is to help the community succeed, even if it means that one user must fail.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Therefore, a good designer of social interfaces will say: let's not display an error message. Let's just pretend that the post on Viagra has been adopted. We will show it to the author so that he is happy and proceeds to the next forum, which is not suitable for such posts. But leave this post invisible to everyone else. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Indeed, one of the best ways to repel attacks is to make them look successful. This is the software equivalent of pretending to be dead.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
No, I will not give guarantees that this will work in 100% of cases. But in 95% of cases, this will definitely work and reduce the number of problems that you encounter by twenty times. Like everything else in sociology, this is a fuzzy heuristic algorithm. He works most of the time, so it's worth it even if he has no protection from the fool. The Russian mafia with its phishing schemes will bypass this mechanism over time. The Florida idiots sitting in their trailer parks and trying to get rich quick will move on. 90% of the spam I receive today is still hopelessly naive about spam filters, such spam could catch the junk e-mail filter built into Microsoft Outlook. And your spam must be really crap so that this dead surface program using simplified search phrases can recognize it.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3>  </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A few months ago, I realized that while designing the software we created at Fog Creek, the typical theme was an almost obsessive emphasis on creating the right social interfaces. For example, FogBugz has many features and even more non-features designed to make the bug tracking mechanism really work. Again and again, users tell me that they never used their old bug tracking software because it didn‚Äôt adapt to the way people wanted to work with it. But when we deployed FogBugz, people really started using it and even became addicted to it, and that changed the way people worked with it. I know that FogBugz works because we have a very high update speed when a new version appears. She tells me that FogBugz is not just useless software,because even users who buy many licenses come back to buy even more, because the product extends beyond their organization and is really used. I'm really proud of it. The software used in teams usually cannot be fixed, because its use requires that everyone in the team simultaneously change their way of working, and this, according to anthropologists, is unlikely. For this reason, FogBugz has many design solutions that make it useful even for one person in a team, and many design features that help it gradually spread among other team members until everyone starts using it.as the product extends beyond their organization and is actually used.

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When working on the forum software used on the Joel on Software website (it will be available soon as a function of FogBugz 4.0), we took even greater care to properly configure aspects of social interfaces. There are dozens of functions and non-functions, as well as design solutions, which together lead to a very high level of interesting conversation with the best signal-to-noise ratio compared to any forum I have ever participated in. I wrote a lot about this in my article </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúBuilding Communities Using Software‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Since then, I have become even more confident in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe importance of good design of social interfaces: we attract experts such as Clay Shirky (a pioneer in this field), put bold experiments on the unfortunate members of the Joel on Software community (many of these experiments are so insignificant that can be almost invisible, for example, the fact that we don‚Äôt show you the message that you reply to while you print your answer to reduce quoting and facilitate reading the thread), and we invest heavily in advanced algorithms to reduce forum spam .</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New subject area</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Designing a social interface is still in its infancy. I have not seen a single book on this subject; only a few people work in this field of research, and there is no organized science of designing social interfaces. At the dawn of usability design, development companies hired ergonomic experts and human factor experts to develop useful products. Ergonomics experts knew a lot about the correct height of a computer table, but they did not know how to develop graphical interfaces for file systems, which created a new area. In the end, a new discipline of user interface design was formed and brought out concepts such as correctness, accessibility, feedback, etc.,which have become a fundamental element of the science of user interface design.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I expect that over the next decade, software companies will hire people trained as anthropologists and ethnographers to design social interfaces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead of building usability laboratories, they will test everything in practice and write ethnography. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope that we will be able to deal with the new principles of designing social interfaces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will be fun ... as much fun as designing a user interface in the 80s ... so stay tuned. </font></font><br>
