<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Free software vs domestic software</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I'll start with the question, free software or software from the registry of domestic software. It was not by chance that I wrote not domestic software, but software from the domestic software registry, because the question of what is considered domestic and what is not was often raised at a conference, for example, in a joint (MTUCI and CCSS) series of reports on the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúTypical Domestic Internet Learning Module Technologies ‚Äù(TOMIIT)</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Hardware was domestic, in particular, a PC based on Elbrus processors. But we studied the usual routing protocols RIPv2, OSPF, BGP, OSPFv3, RIPng. As a result, I could not stand it and asked the speakers a question, but how is your domestic module different from the usual one? But let's take it in order.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The problem of the difference between domestic and free software was clearly manifested in a report by Renat Lapshin, Executive Director of the Russian Software ARPP entitled </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"On the activities of the ARPP Association to ensure compatibility of domestic solutions and education"</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. The report noted that the ARPP Association is supporting domestic software, more than a billion rubles has already been allocated to support domestic system software, and tens of billions are being allocated. The report was so strongly focused on domestic software that it naturally raised a question from the conference participant: ‚ÄúWe are at the Free Software Conference, and you are talking about the domestic one, how do you represent the association you represent as free software?‚Äù The essence of the answer was as follows: of course we in the association love STRs and used to think STRs were completely domestic, but it turned out that no one could be responsible for STRs, therefore, difficulties with quality support and support could arise. Another thing is when a commercial company puts its products on the register,Regardless of the model of development and distribution, this company will provide support services.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The problem is understandable if no one is responsible for the quality of the software, its support and maintenance, it is unlikely that such software will be in demand, even if it is free, because we all know that free cheese only happens in a mousetrap. But at the same time, we, as developers, also know that free software is not so much that it is free, but with its flexible adaptation to the wishes of users, fewer errors (I naturally speak of popular projects), and lower development costs and escort. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the conference there was a report presented by an activist of open source software (yes, it turns out there are such) Sofya Zvereva </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄùOrganizing in the field of open source software. Involving students in the development and use of open source software. "</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. The report showed that doubts about the quality of STRs are well founded. A screenshot was shown on one of the slides, in which ‚ÄúRussification‚Äù was made in the mobile application. In the menu, the inscription in English (Latin) was replaced by the inscription in Russian (Cyrillic); the commit message was approximately of the following content: ‚ÄúHello from a lawyer‚Äù. The slide was supposed to show that anyone can add code to the project they like and thereby improve the product. But since developers were present in the hall, praising for the wonderful impulse, they nevertheless noted that it is possible to leave the development to professionals, because the project does not provide for localization, that is, the replacement was carried out directly in the code. And what will happen if someone doesn‚Äôt like the proposed inscription, and he changes it to another one that he personally likes,in Bashkir (I have nothing against this or some other language). Who is responsible for the software that is installed to the end user? It turns out that just a large number of people can hardly improve the product, but it can worsen. Well, in other words, the Internet refuted the idea that if you give a large number of monkeys typewriters, then sooner or later they will write ‚ÄúWar and Peace‚Äù (</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">endless monkey theorem</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It would seem that everything is true, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a registry of domestic software solves the problem with the quality of software, and the participants on this list are worth supporting. But look at this problem from the other side. The same report cited the </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">law of dialectics on the transition of quantity to quality</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, so he reveals the benefits of open source software. In other words, a software product, if it is distributed only in the local market, will always lose to a similar one in the global market. Of course, I do not mean localization and some highly specialized things. But you must admit, the more the product is used, the better it is tested, and in a variety of conditions. And if the product is not used enough, then it can have only very limited quality functionality. After all, when adding new functionality, errors will inevitably arise! This problem cannot be overcome with the help of modern development tools: code analyzers, modern programming languages, integration and continuous testing systems, and so on. Just because modern software has grown so much in size (functionality,the number of lines of code, and so on), which is difficult to even provide decent coverage with tests.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a report by Stas Fomin entitled </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúUdaff - Russian Pictographic Python. From elementary algorithms to homomorphic encryption ‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, the author perfectly showed the problems of domesticity on the example of creating programming environments. Many of these attempts (the creation of Russian-language programming environments) are justified by the improvement in learning. As a result, incomprehensible languages ‚Äã‚Äãare created, ‚ÄúRussian C‚Äù, ‚ÄúRussian Python‚Äù and so on. At best, these languages ‚Äã‚Äãare used only by the creators themselves, and in special cases, they are introduced by order into the educational process. The author suggested, if a Russian-language programming language is really required, using relatively simple manipulations (replacing keywords with Cyrillic) use the original python, for which there are already a bunch of beautiful and convenient development environments, debugged libraries, and everything that a developer needs, because the language is widely common in the world. Talking about the benefits of the approach,the author invited interested parties to continue the project together with subsequent commercial support, that is, in full accordance with the ideas of open source software.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Let's try to compare the quality of our own programming language, used only in the ‚ÄúRussian-speaking‚Äù segment, and the language that is used all over the world. For some reason, it seems to me that the Russian-language version will benefit only by one indicator - the need for constant injections of money from the state. At the same time, I by no means urge not to develop anything new, just the opposite. Take, for example, the Kotlin language, since there is an island with this name nearby. Well, what is he not domestic? But he appeared not from the need to create his own language, but from the need for a language for certain purposes, which he successfully solves.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But back to the approach proposed in the report about the ‚ÄúRussian snake‚Äù. More precisely, we will discuss what the opposite approach can lead to, the creation of our own proprietary language from scratch. The company (or organization) released a certain proprietary software product and entered it into the register of domestic software. For example, let's return to programming languages, ‚ÄúRussian Pascal‚Äù. It is clear that with the original Pascal in this language only the name will be common. Some state-owned companies are obligatorily switching to this technology. Development begins on it, it is necessary to develop, including all libraries, money is allocated from the state, 5 years later the company that develops this language becomes a monopolist and can render services of inadequate quality for awkward money. It‚Äôs clearthat the company is not very interested in the development of technology and the product, money is not received for the quality of the software, but for the fact that no one can offer an analogue. In the STR model, no company, even the creator of the Russian language, can become a monopolist, because another company will immediately offer an alternative solution to support and develop the product.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It turns out that in the long run, open source software always wins over proprietary software, because you can add commercial support to the open source software not only from one company. And this, in turn, means that it is possible to build world-class software on the basis of open source software, because open source software may well be considered domestic, since a domestic company may well provide quality support for open source software. In addition, it is worth considering that specifically in our country there are a lot of developers of open source software projects, including the Linux kernel, and there are a large number of companies that provide good support based on these projects.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is no need to go far for an example of successful implementation of an approach based on open source software and localization (commercial support). The conference was crowded, there were many representatives of various educational institutions who spoke very well about the support of Alt OS for various requirements from the Ministry of Education (or whatever it is now called). So, Alt-Education distributions by default include various packages that are required in the curriculum. Of course, shortcomings were also expressed, but you need to understand that if Basalt-SPO did not listen to its users, there would be no product improvement, and some other company could easily occupy this niche.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To illustrate the benefits of openness, I will briefly return to the ‚ÄúModel Domestic Internet‚Äù. As I already said, the main emphasis was placed on the fact that ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù elements were used: PCs based on Elbrus processors and Alt OS from the registry of domestic software. There are no questions regarding the OS openness in terms of openness and quality of software, and anyone can check the declared characteristics or use alternative solutions. But the architecture of Elbrus (e2k) does not have such an opportunity. The manufacturer, the MCST company, does not disclose implementation details, and is essentially a monopolist in the development of key software components of the ecosystem: a cross-compiler and the Linux kernel, which greatly inhibits the development of this architecture. At the conference, a report was made by a representative of another company manufacturer of processor Baikal Electronics Roman Stavtsev. The report was called</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Domestic hardware platforms" Baikal "for open source software</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It talked about the models of processors of this company, Baikal-T1 and Baikal-M, both of them are based on cores with an open (described) architecture (mips32, aarch64) respectively, all development tools are in the public domain, and anyone can offer an alternative. Which of course greatly increases the attractiveness of the platform, because it reduces the cost of decisions on it and reduces the risks when using it. In fact, at the MCST, they also understand the problem of closed architecture and have recently </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">released a description of the teams</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My position on this issue is probably understandable, you can achieve technological independence only by developing software, and not just buying it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Inclusion in the register of domestic software refers specifically to sales. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, of course, the support of a domestic manufacturer is very important, and it is very important that there is support from the state and such associations as the ARPP. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it is also important that this software be world-class (or become so in the future), and this is easier to achieve with the STR model. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I hope that described in the article </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúPersonal experience: how I applied to the registry of domestic software, and found a ban for all versions of Linux‚Äù is</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> greatly exaggerated.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Standards Education vs Free Education</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another important issue in the title is ‚ÄúSo what kind of IT education do we need: standard or free?‚Äù In my opinion, this question strongly intersects with the question from one of the previous conferences, which I described in the article </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHow to catch a programmer on cheating and whether it is worth doing it‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but in a more general form. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In order to begin to consider different approaches, it is necessary to formulate the problem (or problems) that we are trying to solve. So in the report of Vladimir Sukhomlin </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe concept of the skills of the information age and the principles of its implementation in the digital skills development system of the Naval Forces of Moscow State University and Basalt SPO‚Äú</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, the author, formulated the problem as follows. The digital economy is coming, the industry is booming, a large number of new specializations are appearing, educational standards are becoming obsolete, but specialists in the field of digital technologies are required by the economy, and accordingly, they need to be trained in the skills necessary for their workplace. The author proposed two ways to solve the problem of improving IT education. First, use not Russian standards, but </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúSFIA information age skill standards‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">or similar, since these are already developed methods by which they work in the world. Secondly, use a platform that allows you to formalize the description of skills for specific specialists. In other words, create a map of skills for any specialist. For example, a company needs a specialist, the company can look in the classifier which specialist it needs, or add a new line to the classifier indicating what skills are required for a new specialization. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were doubts about both approaches during the questions. Indeed, in essence, some standards are replaced by others, which are also becoming obsolete, and HR specialists also successfully cope with the selection of specialists in an IT company, without any maps and classifiers of skills.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main argument made by the author on the sidelines in defense of the proposed approach was as follows: well, we must specify what kind of knowledge is needed for a particular specialist. Based on these principles, there is a selection of personnel (hence, training) for the Pentagon and other reputable organizations. But let's look at a hypothetical situation. Suppose a company needed specialists with a new specialization.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A skills map is formed, a program is formed, certification centers are created, and students are recruited. But only undergraduate studies take 4 years. It turns out that the fastest when the company can get these specialists is 5 years, because at least several months will be spent on the formation of a program based on a new skills map. The current situation is changing so fast that in 5 years these specific skills may simply not be in demand not only in this company, but also in the labor market as a whole. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Well, take, for example, distance learning, in early February no one could imagine that all universities would be forced to switch to a remote school and Zoom will become one of the main tools. Yes, distance learning is gaining momentum, there have been several reports on this topic, for example, a report by Lev Chernyshov</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAn open-source online testing system‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> or a report by Ivan Khakhaev </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAgain on the assessment of electronic educational resources‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But before the pandemic and the sharp transition to udalenka, distance learning was considered more likely as auxiliary. And with the advent of coronavirus, everything changed, and I had to urgently look for a way out. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
That is, the problem is much broader than simply identifying and formally describing the required skills. Embox proposes a different approach. Anton Bondarev‚Äôs talk (mine) </font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúEmbox - the way from student fun to an open source project‚Äù</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> was dedicated to him</font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. The essence of our approach is not to provide specific knowledge to the student, but to develop his ability to gain knowledge himself, and, very importantly, to be able to independently choose what knowledge and areas of development he needs. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, no one has canceled the basic knowledge: mathematics, logic, algorithms and data structures remain unchanged, and, most importantly, they make you learn to think in a certain way. So, at the conference was a report by Sergei Abramov </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHaskell, as the first programming language‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, this language makes you think in a functional paradigm, which is very useful. But, for example, the study of a specific language, development environment or database, who can say which technology will be in demand? In addition, higher education implies precisely the ability to create these very nonexistent technologies. How to teach this? It is a difficult question, but for some reason it seems to me that driving students into the framework of tests and grades is unlikely to contribute to this. Hence the Embox approach - the student does what he is interested in, and we act as senior comrades (mentors, mentors) and help him in this endeavor. In addition, we involve students in the world of open source software, in which there are many other projects and directions besides Embox. And of course, you need to consider that participation in such projects is much more effective than the implementation of standard training tasks,after all, these projects are industrial and industrial development processes are adopted in them.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This year, </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Embox is participating as a mentoring organization on Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . A wonderful initiative that allows students from all over the world to take an internship in a project that interests him. That is, Google does not care about standards, but manages to grow (helps to do this) IT specialists of a very high level. The process does not contain the acquisition of specific knowledge, this is given to universities, because only university students can participate in the program. The process does not require participation only in Google (or American) projects, but the process works based on open source software and allows relatively low costs in collaboration with communities to get high-quality specialists who are able to further develop technologies and build a digital economy.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
