      <div class="post__text post__text-html post__text_v1" id="post-content-body" data-io-article-url="https://habr.com/ru/post/492804/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am not a supporter of anthropomorphism - transferring the human image and its properties to inanimate objects, animals, plants, natural phenomena, supernatural beings, abstract concepts, etc. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But when there is a problem such as this, there is simply a desire to use this terminological and journalistic device. The issues raised in my question, one way or another, are connected with what is happening recently. Half the shots of the all-consuming coronavirus infoemia have not yet died out. And it‚Äôs too early to draw meaningful complex conclusions. But forgive me, where did we all look? Are we followers of Babbage and Turing? An involuntary personification of what basically determines the essence of our workers, scientific interests.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The general problem of information technologies in this particular acute issue is that from the point of view of mathematical modeling, a stack of geo-information technologies, almost nothing happened, and what can already be said with almost certainty - no miracle happened. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The Web has only become an involuntary certifier and aggregator of several ‚Äúregional metronomes‚Äù that are often (as, however, due to objective factors and should be) inconsistent. It is not enough to position the IT industry in its final form as just a conjunction of some iterators at this stage of its development, speaking in terms of discrete mathematics</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In a particular case, IT is not so much the possibility of disseminating information, or its mediocre processing, but the possibility of implementing such an object model platform, which has a naturally decentralized basis (based on the concept of ‚ÄúSaaS‚Äù - software as a service), which would allow reducing minimize the implementation of risks as such, in particular risks of a social nature, implying the entire socially-oriented essence of the web. Recall, for example, the economic theory of risk management, and about its tools. Let us repeat the basic tenets of information security. As if, by chance. After all, why the next thing happened that can be called a pandemic,without much embarrassment? Because the main criterion of a sufficient condition for the possibility of its direct carriers to distribute it (the carrier is a person in our particular case) - the variable (unstable) geolocation tracking, as such - was not taken as a basis determining the actual geographical location of an electronic device, such as a radio transmitter, cell phone or computer. And this, given the country of origin of the problems and the general, specifics mentioned above, which is unforgivable.which is unforgivable.which is unforgivable.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And what is most surprising - having certain ideas that there is such a Chinese government, very opaque hinting at the ideal manager. China, followed by the entire developed world, in which almost every digital device, in one way or another, is personified, that is, not just attached to a person, but also is his digital replication (let‚Äôs omit the general pathetics of this issue, leave an aftertaste and post-analytics), so frankly poorly applied to himself all the already existing inclusive capabilities of the digital world.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As if this whole developed world is an overgrown infant. Infant is an adult with a passport, but with children's values ‚Äã‚Äãand attitudes. And infantilism is terrible because it does not allow a person to grow to the Person. Ideas about the world, people, life in the infant are simplistic-flattened. And if the Personality lives in the real world, then the infant is in the illusory. A person sees life as complex and multidimensional ... The Infant presents it as a kind of kinder surprise. You just need to understand which direction to unfold, and then you will find solid chocolate and a nice little present inside. A person learns from his own and others' mistakes. Infant, stepping on the same rake, is surprised every time.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Why am I talking with such confidence about the possibility of implementing means of determining the circle of people, tracking location, social connections based on graph theory, within the framework of a complex epidemiological situation?</font></font><br>
 <br>
<cut></cut><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Firstly, in countries such as Italy, South Korea, France, Spain, the main determinant of the spread of coronavirus infection, as well as throughout the world (in slightly lower proportions), is a capable population with regular Internet activity. I will not complicate my opus with statistics on the number of mobile contracts per thousand people, the number of active Internet users, etc. Since everything is so obvious here, it is not a question of the Ebola epidemic spreading in the context of ‚Äúdigital blindness‚Äù - when a potential sick person (African) does not in any way replicate his activities via the Internet.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And the problem, after all, is not only in it - after all, one can recall both mobile communications and the fact that in almost all of the countries indicated above (particularly affected at the moment), there are strict legislative mechanisms for identifying a person with a mobile communication identifier. And if we talk about such subjects as the People‚Äôs Republic of China and the European Union again, we can confidently say that these aspects, in view of the long counter-terrorism ‚Äúlegend‚Äù and other events, have long been elevated to absolute.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another thing is clear: there is no natural diversity of the focal points of the pandemic. All occurrences have a strict history and direction of distribution. Vector algebra and graph theory explain everything as simple as possible. But not enough to explain. It is enough to ask only one question - are we adults ... or not? Are we involuntary extras or under-analysts of someone else‚Äôs pain, or those who synthesize simple meanings aimed at solving a problem?</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Maybe it‚Äôs time to introduce digital volunteering, based on such seemingly simple things as building social graphs of the relationship of the sick and their acquaintances (with thoughtful spooling of the latter) - because the main problem of the sick is that among the ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù for doctors Diagnostics include only blood relatives and neighbors, and not friends and acquaintances, and often not the closest ones, and about meetings with which the human memory for some reason leaves no chance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maybe it‚Äôs really worth reviewing the insignificant ... at the moment, the importance of mobile communications, its capabilities, but already for special services (and not only in the context of internal roaming), in the fight against today's virus? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While the "numbers" still allow ...</font></font><br>
