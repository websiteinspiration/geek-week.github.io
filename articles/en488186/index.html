<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Hello! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My name is Luba and I am a QA engineer for the contact center systems development team at Lamoda. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Three years ago, I have recently been working in our company, and this made me think and look again at the events that have occurred since the moment I chose this profession, at the decisions that I made. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At some point in my career path, I ran into burnout, and was close to completely leaving the profession. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I didn‚Äôt leave, but on the contrary I continue to realize myself in the same field, moreover I have been working for a relatively long time in one place, and so far I am not going to leave.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Software testing - is this the profession that I want to do?</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I am a mathematician-programmer by education, but at the institute I realized that I do not want to become a developer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Testing, on the contrary, immediately seemed interesting to me, because it requires a variety of skills (and at the same time it remains an opportunity to code). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For the first three years of my career, I worked in two companies, and in both I was engaged in testing banking software - and I gratefully recall my past jobs and my former colleagues who helped me gain initial experience in the profession. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the first place, I tested WEB applications on tablets / mobile devices (iOS, Android) and desktop client-server applications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I began to apply different types of testing, and new skills appeared in the piggy bank of my technical experience:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I learned to do everything necessary for working in a * nix system through the command line;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">learned how to make requests to Oracle DBMS;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">learned to create and customize your test environment, including using VirtualBox;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I realized the importance of logs and learned how to work with them, as well as adjust them by levels.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then I got a job as an outsourcing company providing testing and analytics services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This work gained me little technical experience: only getting to know SoapUI, integration testing, and on one of the projects I managed to get even more involved in testing mobile applications. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But on some projects, I managed to try myself in the role of analyst and test lead for a small team of testers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I talked a lot with both colleagues and customers, which helped me to develop software skills.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In these first three years, I realized that I was not mistaken, testing is really very diverse, and I like the work in this area. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the more experience appeared, the more I began to demotivate some points that at first seemed quite acceptable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Basically, these were the features of the organization of work processes adopted by the company - something that I could not influence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I tried to cope with discomfort by investing my internal resources, because I liked the work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at some point it stopped working.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Burnout</font></font></h1><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was a millennial on open space, sees - the work is on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He sat down for her and burned out.</font></font><br>
</blockquote><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8h/-o/cq/8h-ocqh-n6g_bdlwbixxfcead90.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
By the end of the third year of work, I had burned out so much that for three months I simply went ‚Äúnowhere‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resting and recovering, I tried to understand what exactly brought me into such a state. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most critical moments for me were:</font></font><br>
 <br>
<ul>
<li><b>   :</b>     (/),          .</li>
<li> <b>     :</b>        ,  ,         .          ,       QA-    ,       .</li>
<li> <b>      </b>,     ,    .</li>
<li><b>        </b>  ,    ,     ,  .</li>
<li>          .       <b>     </b>.</li>
<li>    <b>     </b> -   ‚Äî , , .</li>
<li>   ‚Äî  ,  <b>   ¬´ ¬ª</b>      ,   ,  ,         .</li>
</ul><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l8/dz/ph/l8dzphl8eeigjqrb1jm22wpzecy.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All these unpleasant things, if you think about it, are not directly related to the profession of a software tester. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at that moment, of course, it was difficult for me to separate one from the other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when, after the break, I again had the desire to go in search of work, I thought about changing my profession to an adjacent one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, go to analytics, or try to continue in the role of QA Lead. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But at the same time, I realized that I incredibly like the technical component of my profession. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then I realized that I want to continue to develop as a QA engineer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That analytics is likely to bore me without technical points, and in the role of QA Lead I will gradually lose technical skills. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And according to my feelings, in the near future, strong technical specialists will be more in demand in the labor market.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Search for a new job</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This time I entered the labor market as an experienced enough specialist. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I determined for myself a list of requirements by which I evaluated the offers of employers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, I would like to see the same disadvantages that caused my burnout at the new place of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Separately, I identified a few more criteria:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the subject of testing should no longer be associated with banking software;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the company should not have bureaucracy;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and most importantly, to be satisfied with the work, I must see the results of my work and receive feedback from users and my colleagues.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A long search began. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was not very pleased with the proposals received - it seemed that most of the disadvantages of the previous places would be here. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And suddenly I remembered that a year ago I was staring at a job as a QA engineer at Lamoda. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the interview, I was hooked by the fact that it was supposed to do a lot of technical tasks, use new tools for me and test a large and complex system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And that normal communication is one of the company's values.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And so it was possible?</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The first unusual thing that I came across in a new place was that here all the work is done by the team. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This is manifested in established processes in the form of adapted scrum - synchronous 2-week iterations in each team, during which various meetings are held (meetings, grooming, assessment of tasks, discussion of projects). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My workload is planned taking into account the fact that I will attend all these meetings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, I am always up to date with all the project news.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Healthy working relationship</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Personally, I really like that there is no testers department as such, headed by a supervisor. When there is a dual subordination - the team leader of the developers and the head of the testing department - sometimes there is a conflict of interests and a struggle for resources for certain tasks. </font></font><br>
<br>
<b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Lamoda QA, an engineer is part of a specific system team</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And it turns out that I am subordinate to the team leader of my team, who is aware of my current and upcoming work, and this helps us to effectively conduct 1-to-1 meetings. At them we discuss my painful work, and the team leader tries to help with everything necessary, and also determines further possible development vectors. That is, I get the very feedback from colleagues through team lead - something that I really missed before.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And I began to feel absolutely normal when I needed to ask for help from a developer or analyst, or even other teams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nobody makes you stupid if you don‚Äôt know something, but on the contrary share knowledge, and welcome this approach.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Autonomy in work</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Especially important for me was the availability of access wherever needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I can independently configure my test environment as I need, climb into the database and logs, and also see the application code as a whole and all changes in it according to the task request pool. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, when I take a task to work, I see what exactly was changed in the code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this stage, I can already notice the defects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If I understand that I need to check the exchanges with another system, then I can deploy any other system on my testbed myself - raise databases for it, containers with the necessary version, roll migrations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I do not need to ask one of my colleagues to do this.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Knowledge sharing culture</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From the very beginning of my work at Lamoda, I was incredibly pleased with the openness to sharing knowledge accepted in the team. This greatly simplifies many work points. But knowledge sharing works really effectively when it is shared by the whole company, when a whole culture has formed, and each employee is a part of it (about how exactly this was achieved at Lamoda, my colleague recently wrote in an </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">article</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ). I appreciated all the advantages of this culture on myself, and with pleasure I now support it myself.</font></font><br>
<blockquote> ,     ,     ,               .      ,       ,              .    ,       ,      ,        .<br>
</blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, such banal awareness came that instead of writing abstruse documentation (which is still written very rarely and slowly), you can simply share knowledge in notes accessible to all, and in the simplest possible language. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After working in the banking sector, this was unusual for me, and I deliberately weaned myself from adding excessive terminology and ‚Äúwater‚Äù. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Leaving such notes, first of all, I take care of myself future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Which, after a while, will be forgotten, as I checked something the last time, and here my notes from the past will come in handy. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And over time, I realized that it was possible and necessary to share knowledge not only within the company, but also outside - at various conferences and meetings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, I once made a </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">report on integration testing</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, or an article here you can write =)</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1>     -</h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Our company has a really large IT unit, more than 340 engineers, and I constantly work with only one part of it. But, thanks to integration testing, I get acquainted with the systems that other teams support and develop, and even participated in testing them at times when those teams had difficulty with the resources for this. And this is again the very diversity that I love in my work. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is also very important to me that I can look inside all the processes that are built in the system. For example, it is possible to observe the work of call center operators. What turned out to be very useful for me, as a call center tester, I was able to better understand the business logic of some cases, as well as see the weak spots in the application and tell the team about them in order to make improvements in the near future.</font></font><br>

</blockquote><h1>         </h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the past few months, I have joined the guys who conduct interviews to find new QA engineers in our backend teams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It also turned out to be very useful: I pumped up soft skills and even learned new technical things from the candidates. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus, it was very nice to help find really cool specialists in their field, with the same burning eyes as mine, with whom I then work together to get high.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recently, I had a transition from one team to another, and I wanted to leave the system and all my developments in good hands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it was especially important for me at this moment that I could personally interview new candidates and choose the best one.</font></font><br>
</blockquote><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What, in fact, have I tested all this time?</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the beginning, I got into the Order Processing system team for storing and processing orders (a colleague told more about this system in an </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">article</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that moment it was a very large monolith written in PHP, which communicated with a huge number of other systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And, honestly, at first it was difficult and painful to test it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I had never before encountered such systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over 3-4 months, testing of each task began almost from scratch - they all related to completely different functionality, and required different approaches to testing. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
But personally, I realized that I enjoy such complex challenges. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because, firstly, it does not get boring, and secondly, there are many opportunities for developing technical skills.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hooray, finally automation!</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here, I finally got the opportunity to get acquainted with test automation and do it closely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I always had a point that I would not want to forget the acquired programming skills. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
And now I am engaged in testing automation for php + codeception - my colleague talked about how it works in </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this article</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The whole team is working on the creation of integration auto-tests, trying to ensure that as a result, hands-on testing had to be done only once when developing new functionality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regression in my system is already covered by autotests, and it pleases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Passing the same scripts manually from time to time is probably the most unloved part of the work of many testers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is much more pleasant to spend this time developing your skills and other interesting activities.</font></font><br>
</blockquote><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Frequent changes - extra difficulties or an opportunity for development?</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Of course, over the three years I have not always been fine. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For example, over the past few months there have been changes in the team supporting CI / CD. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this period there were problems with the test environment, they were solved for a long time, or they were completely left without a solution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this upset me and made my work less enjoyable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at some point I realized that a large number of changes that are difficult to predict are an integral part of working with any really complex system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in all this you can find the pluses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I managed to better understand my test environment, I learned to fix some problems on my own.</font></font><br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It happened that the containers in the docker after lifting almost immediately fell. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here it was necessary to get into the logs of the container, understand what exactly went wrong, and try to localize it on your own or understand which of the developers can be attracted for help. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, this method was much faster and more effective than waiting for help from the guys from CI / CD.</font></font><br>
</blockquote><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My technical growth: specifics</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Compared to past places of work, I feel that for now I have been growing professionally ‚Äúfor three years,‚Äù my tasks were so different and rich. </font></font><br>
 <blockquote>       ?<br>
 ‚Äî           Jenkins, VirtualBox,        .<br>

</blockquote><h1>  :     </h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Despite this kind of great variety in work, after about 2 years I felt that I had again stopped in development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tasks became repetitive, I just started to get bored. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, I openly talked about my thoughts and feelings to my team leader at the 1-to-1 meeting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out that the company is ready to give me a lot of opportunities for horizontal development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A month later, I was offered to go to the Callcenter team with a rather different technical stack, which I work in now.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What did this transition give me?</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
From the point of view of the test object itself, I again plunged into a completely new area for myself. The call center is about telephony, there is a completely different architecture of the whole system, not similar to all those with which I worked earlier. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The system itself consists of several services that are historically written in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã- there are PHP, Go, Scala, and JS Node. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There were very few notes and documentation; there were no integration autotests. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In fact, I got the opportunity to build testing from scratch for a large and complex system. We ourselves come up with and establish internal team processes - as we agree, it will be so. So, we decided from the very beginning to work on test automation, using tools convenient for our team.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
So the problem with boredom was definitely resolved, I feel that I am now making a huge leap in professional development.</font></font><br>

<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What am I feeling right now?</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Personally, it is surprising to me that the fire in my eyes did not diminish for the three years spent in the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps I really found that very occupation and place in life that I wish for everyone. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Here I do not feel isolated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I always have the opportunity to develop technology, test different systems, switch to other teams, which means to learn something new again and participate in various general events, which allows me to really feel the value and importance of my work.</font></font><br>

<h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And how, in the end, can an engineer cope with burnout QA?</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There is no universal medicine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, there can be many reasons leading to burnout. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But here are the conclusions that I have drawn from my experience.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>   ,  ,         ,      ,    .</li>
<li>   ,  .    ‚Äî       ,    ,      .       ,    ,          .   ,       =)</li>
<li>    ,      .     ,    - ,      .</li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Companies with a modern and diverse technological stack allow you not to foul as a specialist, because you have to keep up with the times, studying all these technologies.</font></font></li>
</ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you feel tired and annoyed, and think that testing is no longer your business - think about it, maybe it‚Äôs in the working environment, and not in the profession as such. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is likely that you are tired of the fact that the processes are not established, the work goes ‚Äúto the table‚Äù and the results of work are not felt, the communication in the team is too complicated and takes away a lot of energy ... There are many demotivating factors. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is possible to find your own business and your own place: sometimes you need to look outside, sometimes you need to negotiate inside. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main thing is to clearly understand what is not happening right now and how we would like to, and clearly convey our expectations and Wishlist.</font></font></div>
