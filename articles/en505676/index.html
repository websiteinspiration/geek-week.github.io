Data center engineers often face the problem of overheating servers and take many different actions to eliminate it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some of their actions make it possible to solve the problem, but only for a short time, and at the same time they can create even more overheating points. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The simplest and most cost-effective way to solve the problem, which saves energy, which in turn avoids the capital cost of cooling equipment, is to control air flow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This article describes the main causes of server overheating, gives recommendations for identifying and eliminating them, and also discusses the typical actions of engineers in such a situation.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f1/7s/u_/f17su_-ivzeh5d0x38korp9t-jw.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Introduction</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
According to a study conducted by the Uptime Institute, 10% of racks generate more heat than prescribed in the instruction manual. As the rack power density in the data center increases on average to 5 kW or more, it is expected that the percentage of hot spots will increase. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the hot spots are active for a long period, this can be a serious threat not only to the reliability and performance of the equipment, but also to warranties or service agreements. Therefore, data center employees need to take measures as soon as possible to avoid these risks.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
To begin with, we need to find out what the “hot spots” are, the reasons for their appearance and how to identify them. As a rule, after detecting points with high temperature, the data center engineers take various measures to eliminate them. Some actions include: setting an extremely low cooling temperature, placing perforated tiles in a hot corridor, and placing fans on a stand in front of problem areas. These simple steps can temporarily fix the problem, but can also lead to unnecessary energy loss or even create even more places with excess heat.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Understanding the root causes of hot spots is crucial in the fight against equipment overheating. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It also provides additional benefits in the form of energy savings and helps to avoid additional economic costs for the purchase of additional cooling equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cited document describes the root cause of the “hot spots”, provides recommendations for their determination, discusses typical actions and recommendations for their elimination.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are hot spots?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In most cases, specialists measure the temperature in a hot corridor or in the wrong place in a cold corridor and think that they have found a hot spot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Further, measures are taken to resolve the problem, but sometimes it turns out that the chosen method to eliminate the hot spot not only does not help, but on the contrary creates even more places with excess heat. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Understanding what a hot spot really is, the main reasons for the appearance and the correct identification methods, is crucial in solving the problem of overheating.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Definition</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A hot spot is not a random place with a fever inside a data center. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The hot spot is defined as the area where the IT equipment is located, with a temperature exceeding the permissible value established in the recommendations of ASHRAE TC 9.9. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hot spots occur most often at the top of the rack. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recommended and acceptable temperature ranges can be found in the ASHRAE thermal guidelines.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Main reasons</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Often in Data Centers an excess amount of cooling equipment is installed, especially when the cooling capacity is determined by the nominal "factory" capacity of IT equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If there is enough cooling equipment, why do hot spots appear? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The real reason lies not in excessive heat load or lack of cooling devices, but in their improper use. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, cooling is enough, but due to the lack of airflow control, cold air does not get to the places where it is needed at a certain point in time, resulting in zones with excess heat.</font></font><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/mc/xn/hvmcxnkxlcfuc3zhofqqkcfpz_u.png" alt="image"></div><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fig 1. An example of the use of cooling in a conventional and real data center.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Figure 1 shows an example of an improper use of cooling, based on a real study by Schneider Electric. This is a traditional perimeter data center. Raised floor and suspended ceiling are used as a distribution chamber for supply and exhaust air. First, cold air is supplied to the floor chamber with a certain pressure and speed using the CRAH units. The cold air then moves into the rack area through the perforated tile (54% of the CRAH airflow) and open cutouts in the raised floor slabs (46% of the CRAH airflow). Leakage of air from the cutouts leads to a loss of cooling capacity, since air does not enter the front of the rack, but bypasses it instead.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most of the airflow from the perforated tiles, namely 96.29% of the perforated airflow, passes through the equipment in the racks. A small part of the cold air, 3.71% of the perforated air flow, bypasses the servers and returns back to the cooling units. Lack of airflow control results in loss of cooling capacity. Meanwhile, some servers cannot get enough cold air and therefore have to compensate for the difference by drawing in hot airflow (7.15% of the airflow) from the back of the rack, which often causes a hot spot in the front upper corner. Consequently, actions that reduce air leakage, bypass and air recirculation help to eliminate areas with excess heat.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The laws of energy conservation and conservation of air mass allow you to calculate the percentage of various types of air flows described above in this data center:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">52% of all CRAH airflow enters the front of the racks;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">46% of the available cooling power is lost due to leakage through cable cutouts, openings under the racks or inappropriate perforated plates, and 2% of the CRAH cooling is lost due to bypass air. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These problems are due to the lack of airflow control;</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7.2% of the total air flow is recycled (that is, the hot air stream is recycled back to the front of the racks, which is one of the main causes of hot zones);</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">92.9% of the total air flow, which is 52% of the total CRAH air flow, is returned to the CRAH units (CRAH - Computer Room Air Handler) through the ceiling.</font></font></li>
</ul><br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to identify a hot spot?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you find a hot spot as early as possible, this makes it possible to prevent overheating and improper operation of the equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are three main ways to detect a hot spot:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Feel walking around the data center.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Measure the temperature manually.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Automatic monitoring.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The cheapest and easiest way to detect hot spots is to feel the elevated temperature by applying your hands to the front of the equipment rack. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not a very accurate method, but it is quite effective for extremely hot zones. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Measuring temperatures in manual mode is a good method, because the meters show the exact temperature. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apply various equipment for measuring temperature:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plastic temperature strips — a temperature thermometer or a thermometer with a plastic strip — is a type of thermometer that contains thermosensitive liquid crystals in a plastic strip that change color depending on the temperature.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Temperature pistols.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thermometers.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Infrared Sensor (FLIR) in cameras.</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Manual temperature measurement is an inexpensive but effective way to identify places with excess heat. Even infrared cameras that allow you to create thermal diagrams with accurate temperature data in real time are available today for around $ 300. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Data center engineers can use these tools to collect temperature data at the server inlet at the front of the rack and at the back of the rack, which allows you to obtain data on the temperature difference and determine the cooling efficiency.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Automatic monitoring is the best method, since it can display the temperature inside the data center in real time. Automatic monitoring is carried out using software that allows you to manage the data center infrastructure (DCIM), which in real time sends an e-mail or text message to a specific person when a certain temperature threshold is reached. Using the DCIM functionality, you can get the actual temperature at the input and output of the device, depending on your requirements. Schneider Electric's StruxureWareTM can serve as an example of this type of DCIM software, allowing you to get detailed 3D heatmaps using data from installed sensors in real time. This is the most expensive and accurate method.In addition, the equipment itself (servers) often has temperature sensors that monitor the temperature of the components and notify of high heat load through monitoring available through IPMI.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Additional ways to identify or prevent potential hot spots include:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The use of PDUs (Power Distribution Unitn), capable of measuring power consumption, in racks with a higher density of equipment, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">when consumption is expected to be greater than 5 kW.</font></font></li>

</ul><br>
<h3>   </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As soon as a hot spot is detected, data center engineers take various actions to fix the problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, not all methods used are effective. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next section describes standard actions and explains how they can be useful or vice versa. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Please note that most of the points below do not reduce air bypass or recirculation.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Setting an extremely low cooling temperature (only for temporary use in emergency situations).</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Placing perforated tiles in a hot corridor (inefficient practice).</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Placing racks and perforated tiles next to cooling equipment (inefficient practice).</font></font></li>

<h3>     (      )</h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It seems logical that a lower temperature of the incoming air will help solve the problem of hot spots. However, you need to use this in extreme need, as this can reduce the overall efficiency and performance of the cooling system. The effect of this action depends on the loading of CRAC / CRAH blocks. If the cooling system has additional power (i.e., it operates at a load of less than 100% and does not have its own thermodynamic limit), then a decrease in the set value can have a positive effect. When the CRAC / CRAH is in close proximity to the hot zone, setting an extremely low cooling temperature can lower the temperature.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If the cooling unit is already operating at its maximum power (100% load), then it is impossible to lower the set temperature, since the system is already at its maximum operating temperature and can not do anything to solve the problem of overheating. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each cooling system has its own maximum power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This “maximum” power decreases as the setpoint decreases.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Placing perforated plates in a hot corridor (inefficient practice)</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some people think that placing perforated tiles in a hot corridor is a good method, since there is no understanding of the benefits of a hot / cold corridor scheme and any hot zone is perceived as a problem. This method does not eliminate hot spots in cold corridors, and sometimes it can even create more problems. In addition, placing perforated plates in the hot aisle reduces the availability of cooling equipment. The layout of the hot / cold aisle rows is best practice. It is important that the cold aisle remains cold, because it is the so-called “cold air reservoir” for equipment.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the early days of air-cooled mainframes, cooling was realized using a raised floor, and cooling equipment controlled the return temperature. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This approach worked thanks to the uniform, well-mixed air in the room. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, the layout of hot and cold corridors specifically creates areas with hot and cold temperatures, which, by design, lead to an uneven temperature of return air. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People who are accustomed to a uniform temperature in the room can place perforated tiles with cooling in a hot corridor, believing that they solve the problem of overheating equipment.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Placing racks and perforated tiles next to cooling equipment (inefficient practice)</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some people think that a good way to get maximum cooling power is to place racks and perforated plates a few feet from the cooling equipment. In fact, this can give the opposite effect. The above actions can lead to insufficient supply of equipment with cold air, which in consequence will not solve the problem with hot zones. Although this method can help pick up most of the recycled hot air. The reason this method can lead to insufficient replenishment of the equipment is because the air leaving the fan of the cooling unit usually moves at a very high speed, which creates low static pressure in this area. It means,that perforated plates produce very little cold air in this area and can even suck air into the underground plenum. Correct - if the racks are placed at a distance of at least 3 tiles from the cooling units.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An easy way to identify problems with air velocity under the raised floor is to place a small sheet of paper on the perforated tile. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the paper is drawn in by a perforated tile, it should be replaced with a solid one to balance the pressure under the raised floor.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Installing fans on a stand in front of the problem rack (temporary use only)</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It is sometimes believed that installing fans is a good way, as the air flow is directed directly to the place with excess heat. However, this action should only be used temporarily and in emergency situations, for example, when the equipment may turn off due to overheating. This method (shown in Figure 2) can eliminate the hot spot by lowering the current temperature of the equipment. Pedestal fans, in fact, work as mixers, mixing the exhaust air of the equipment and the cold incoming. This creates a temperature that is higher than the supply temperature, but colder than the exhaust air from the equipment. Which will also allow to increase the air flow passing through the equipment. Mixing hot and cold air will reduce the efficiency of the cooling system,as well as inadequate use of resources. Among other things, fans are an additional source of heat in the data center.</font></font><br>

An example of support fans placed in front of the problem rack to eliminate hot spots.</font></font></i><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Launching air through ice into a cold corridor (inefficient practice)</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some consider this a good practice, as ice is a simple solution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although this solution, illustrated in Figure 3, can help alleviate the problem, there remains the risk of water spilling from containers that fill up as the ice melts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if you use closed ice packs, this is still an impractical method. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are much more efficient and simpler solutions, which will be described in the next section.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deployment of the portable cooling unit (temporary use only)</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some people think that this is also a good way, as the flow of cold air goes directly in front of a specific place with excess heat. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, this method must be used only temporarily and in emergency situations, for example, if the equipment can be turned off. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, this method is often used as a permanent solution to the problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Portable cooling devices are usually operated in case of problems with the cooling system, since data center employees can easily install them. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
However, the most effective, practical, and cost-effective methods for eliminating and spreading hot spots will be discussed in the next section.</font></font><br>

<h3>    ( ,  )</h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Basically, the appearance of a hot spot is associated with a lack of cooling capacity, as a result of which some people think that adding equipment is a good way to solve the problem. However, in most cases, cooling is sufficient, but it cannot reach the required location due to the lack of airflow control. In addition, this action does not always solve the problem of hot zones, but is accompanied by a significant investment. According to a study by the Uptime Institute, in server rooms with cooling capacity 15 times higher than required, hot zones were still present in 7–20% of racks. The reason for this is that cold air enters the air intakes of the equipment. The right approach is to first apply effective methods to solve the problem,discussed in the next section, and then only check if you really need more refrigeration units.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Separation of racks with high density equipment (good method)</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
This action involves moving servers from one rack to another to eliminate a temperature problem - equipment redistribution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is actually a good solution method, which is discussed in the next section.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Best ways to fix hot spots</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most of the generally accepted methods for solving the problem of hot spots listed above are not recommended, because they do not eliminate the two main causes of the appearance of zones with excess heat: bypass (bypassing the air of the desired zone) and recirculation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The complete elimination of bypass and recirculation means that the flows of hot and cold air are completely separated, this means that hot spots simply cannot exist. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first four methods listed below are effective because they solve the problem of bypass air and recirculation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The last recommendation is the best, but should only be implemented after the implementation of practical methods of airflow control.</font></font><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Airflow control in the rack.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Air flow control in the room.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Redistribution of load.</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Change the location of the air temperature sensor.</font></font></li>
<li> DCIM     .</li>
</ol><br>
<h3>    </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Many hot spots result from the recirculation of hot exhaust air in or around the rack. Therefore, improving rack airflow control plays an important role in resolving the problem. Open U-shaped shelves and cable management are a common cause of recirculation, resulting in hot spots. Using plugs to fill unused space and brushes for cable entries is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to improve laminar flow in a rack. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For more information about airflow control using plugs, see Technical Paper 44, “Improving Rack Cooling Performance with Airflow Plugs”.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Some switches and routers require two-way cold airflow. If we talk about data centers with a traditional air flow between the racks, the hot air leaving the switch / router can return, and as a result create overheating points. The rack-mounted air distribution systems shown in Figure 4a can be used to supply cold air from both sides, eliminating the possibility of the formation of hot zones. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
For more information on this topic, see Technical Documentation 50, Cooling Options for Rack Equipment with Side Airflow.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In places with sufficient cooling and high density equipment, hot spots may appear. In this situation, the modernization of fan devices can help to improve airflow and increase cooling capacity.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The devices shown in Figure 4b can efficiently “borrow” air from neighboring racks in order to allow the removal of additional heat generated by the equipment with a power of 3 kW per rack. This can minimize the temperature difference between the upper and lower parts of the rack and also prevent the recirculation of hot exhaust air at the inlet. As with all air-absorbing devices, care must be taken when placing it so that air drawn from an adjacent space does not cause it to overheat. These devices must be powered by the UPS in order to avoid equipment shutdown during a power outage. In areas of high equipment density, overheating may occur during the time required to start the backup generator.</font></font><br>

Some people think that if you place as many perforated plates in each row as possible, this will help to provide the right amount of cooling. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, too many tiles violate the laminarity of the air flow along the route. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Adding perforated plates does not always solve the problem of areas with excess heat, but if you remove a few, it can help air get to the problem areas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The following guide shows how. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
First take a flow meter and measure the total CFM in a row. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then divide by 125 CFM / kW, and this value should be approximately equal to the rack power in the row. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If not, you need to remove several tiles and repeat the above procedure until they become approximately the same.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indoor airflow control</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
After improving rack airflow control, the next important step is to improve indoor airflow control. First you need to close all the holes in the raised floor. The sealant should be used to seal cable cutouts behind the racks and under the PDU. These openings cause unwanted air leaks. It is necessary to fill the gaps around the cooling devices and other holes in the floor with foam, find the perforated tiles that are the source of the bypass, and replace them with solid ones. For example, if a tile is placed in front of an empty rack, then it must be replaced by a solid one. Also balance the airflow under the floor. Proper placement of the slabs in combination with sealing the openings on the raised floor will restore lost cooling power.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Another reason for the occurrence of hot spots is the mixing of hot and cold air, which occurs at the top and at the ends of the rack. One of the main methods is the separation of hot and cold corders using racks around the perimeter. Figure 5 shows examples of insulating hot and cold corridors. Isolation not only helps fix hot spots, but also provides the added benefit of energy savings over traditional data center designs without using isolated modules. For more information about deploying a containment in existing data centers, see Technical Documentation 153, Implementing Insulation of Hot and Cold Air in Existing Data Centers.For more information about deploying a containment for a new data center, see Technical Documentation 135, “Effects of Containment of Hot and Cold Aisles on the Temperature and Efficiency of a Data Center.”</font></font><br>

Figure 6a shows an example of an active rack with an individual duct. The rear door of the rack can be replaced by a device that moves air, which allows you to build a rack with an active duct. But these devices add approximately 250 mm (10 inches) to the total rack depth, which is likely to increase the pitch (pitch) between adjacent rows of racks. Hot exhaust air, which is usually pushed into the hot passage, is collected and moved upward, where it is directed into the air exhaust chamber. This eliminates rack recirculation and increases the efficiency and productivity of the cooling system. Fans in an active duct system allow rack-mounted equipment densities of up to 12 kW and can overcome adverse pressure or pressure drops resulting from very tight cable routing at server outputs.However, active racks can easily lead to unexpected consequences in other areas of the data center, therefore, systems must be used with extreme caution. For these devices, it is important to use plugs and side panels. Individual air duct racks consume energy and require regular monitoring and maintenance. See White Paper 182, “Using a Ceiling Duct in Data Centers,” for more information on this topic.See White Paper 182, “Using a Ceiling Duct in Data Centers,” for more information on this topic.See White Paper 182, “Using a Ceiling Duct in Data Centers,” for more information on this topic.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The upper part of the rack with a high density of equipment, most often can not get enough cold air to ensure proper heat dissipation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Figure 6b shows an example of a floor-mounted device that, with the help of fans, can provide the desired airflow through a rack, which depends on temperature or pressure under the floor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This ensures efficient heat removal from racks with equipment with a total capacity of up to 12 kW from a rack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Distribution of problem load (power)</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As discussed above, moving equipment from problematic hot spots to a rack with lower energy consumption can solve the problem. But it is also important to provide the room with sufficient power and cooling, which allows you to remove heat from the power consumption, as well as evenly distribute the load across all cabinets. In places where the load exceeds the permissible value, it is necessary to divide the equipment into several cabinets.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We want to note that the distribution of equipment between several racks leaves a significant amount of unused space in the cabinet in their upper parts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This space must be filled with plugs to avoid a decrease in cooling performance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it is possible to turn off the server or other important equipment, then this action can fix the overheating zone at the lowest cost. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For more information on this topic, see White Paper 46, “Cooling Strategies for Ultra High Density Racks and Blade Servers”.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Changing the location of the temperature sensor</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In most older data centers, thermostats are installed in a CRAC return air stream, which can be unpredictable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can also lead to uneven loading of CRAC, which in turn leads to temperature fluctuations at the server inlet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moving the thermostats into the supply air stream, on which the exhaust temperature depends, will ensure a uniform temperature of the equipment at the inlet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In combination with other methods, moving the thermostat also allows you to increase the supply air temperature, thereby saving energy of the cooling system, without worrying about changes in the supply air temperature.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">DCIM resolution for airflow control of cooling devices</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
There are systems that control individual room cooling devices depending on the temperature in front of the rack. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These systems use comprehensive algorithms for dynamic prediction and adjustment of the fan speed, and also show which cooling units can be disabled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By establishing control over the amount of air in the data center, you can reduce possible bypasses (inefficient air bypass flows). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An example of such a system is the Vigilent cooling system.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conclusion</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Zones with local overheating can lead to reduced reliability, performance, or even server damage. Hot spots usually appear at the equipment inlet due to inefficient airflow control, such as cold air leakage due to bypass flows (bypasses) and hot exhaust air recirculation. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Feeling the elevated temperature while walking around the data center, measuring it manually or setting up automatic temperature monitoring are the three main ways to detect places with excess heat.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most of the actions that data center employees take to solve problems with hot zones are either temporary and are used in extreme situations, or they are inefficient and can only aggravate the situation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rack and room airflow control, localization, movement of problem equipment, relocation of air temperature sensors, and DCIM's ability to control airflow from cooling equipment are effective, simple, and economical methods for resolving hot spot problems.</font></font><br>
