<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tesla relies on computer vision, not lidar (Tesla presentation). </font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Last month at Tesla Autonomy Day, Elon Musk declared war on the use of lidars in unmanned vehicles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recently, he often spoke sharply about the lidar, but on that day he stated:</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Lidar is a waste of time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All who rely on lidar are doomed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dear sensors are not needed. ” </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Elon Musk</font></font></blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All major unmanned vehicle development companies and most startups use lidar along with cameras and radar. Tesla remains aloof and uses only cameras and radar. The choice of Tesla is clear - as long as there is no lidar that can be used in the production of unmanned vehicles. Tesla could not put a serious lidar on its cars, even if it wanted to. In the future, she is still not going to use it. I will try to explain the points of view of those who are for and against lidar.</font></font><br>
<a name="habracut"></a><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Lidar is a laser radar that sends pulses of invisible light and measures the time it takes for them to return. It gets a black and red image of the world in low resolution, with the exact distance to each pixel. Some lidars can tell how fast the target was moving. To summarize, the lidar has superhuman vision, but low resolution, high price and limited range. This means that it is not the best solution for all measurements. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I have a more detailed </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">article on the differences between cameras and lidar</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Tesla solved the problem with just 8 cameras (3 in the front, 2 on each side, 1 in the back), a front radar and a pair of ultrasonic sensors. Most others use the same, but usually add more radars and one or more lidars. Someone adds different lidars and even night vision cameras. Tesla's approach is cheaper, although it requires a lot of processing power. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c88/2e1/14c/c882e114cf25926160078d313db5a203.jpg" alt="image"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Elon Musk claims that lidar is boring. This is a crutch.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Musk said that lidar is a crutch. Why do so many people disagree with him? Firstly, most teams believe that the time has not yet come to cut costs. Now you need to ensure maximum security, do it as quickly as possible and be the first to enter the market. If we choose to use lidar and cameras instead of lidars alone, then we get a faster and safer way. The best choice is more reliable information. Reliability is a key factor. Using only cameras, you need to perceive the approaching image on a human level. If a person doesn’t have a lidar with an incredible ability to measure distance, he understands how far the object is, with its brains. We know the size of people and machines, therefore, we understand that the smaller they look, the further they are obviously located. We determine the distancewatching how things move relative to each other while moving in space.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
When objects are close, we also recognize the distance with two “stereo” eyes and focusing the light. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are useful, but it turns out people can drive normally even with one farsighted eye. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The bottom line is a proper understanding of the environment.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“They will all stop using lidar, remember my words” </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Elon Musk</font></font></blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Lidar knows how far the object is without any understanding of what kind of object is in front of it. It determines the distance almost perfectly. For many things, it is 100% reliable, exactly what we need. People can add “understanding" of the world to the lidar and are already doing it. However, this is not always necessary, and his errors of understanding are quite tolerable. Lidar works equally day and night. Cameras, in turn, must constantly work with an ever-changing color. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d94/c2b/b30/d94c2bb304c8ad9299678979b58c10f0.jpg" alt="image"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Brad Templeton, author of the article, creator of the first generation Google machine with a huge lidar on the roof for $ 75,000. Now lidars are much cheaper, and soon will be even cheaper and better.</font></font></i> <br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Computer vision is still lagging. Yes, over the past few years there have been certain breakthroughs and everyone uses it. But it is not yet 100% reliable. The question remains whether it will be so reliable, and if so, when? </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most people think this is only a matter of time. Tesla and the rest say that if people can drive using only two eyes, the desired can be achieved. But we travel using legs, this does not mean that cars should have legs instead of wheels. Birds flap their wings, but this does not mean that airplanes should do the same. Sometimes it’s better to approach technology like a car. Time will tell.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Early lidars were very expensive, but like all electronic equipment, they began to get cheaper over time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many companies are building new lidars at prices that will not greatly affect the price of a taxi or personal car. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the question of money is not worth it (the time to cut costs has not yet come), the developers have obviously made the right choice in favor of high reliability.</font></font><br>
<br>
<blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Once the issue of computer vision is resolved, the lidar will become useless.” </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 - Elon Musk</font></font></blockquote><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Musk knows that solving the problem of unmanned vehicles is difficult, despite his eternal claims that Tesla will do it soon. The problem is so complex that it requires really good computer vision to solve it. Most people will agree with him - they do not think that lidar will cope with this problem alone. However, the machine of the first generation Google showed itself perfectly, despite the fact that only lidar and radar were installed in it.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Musk claims that computer vision should be so good that he can perform all the functions of a lidar. It should work in any light, like the visual cortex of a person. It must reliably determine the distance to the object. If computer vision can do all of the above, we will not need lidar. In this case, if you used lidar in the development, you threw the money away and spent a lot of time on what you would not need. The cameras have much higher resolution due to color. They can see objects at a very long distance. Your camera already knows how to work so well, and maybe even better. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Perhaps Musk is right - once. No one knows when. I am sure this will not happen today and probably will not happen until 2030. But we need to build cars now. We know that cheap lidar is coming.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Tesla makes a big bet. She looks forward to a breakthrough in computer vision. She hopes that she will make this breakthrough using special equipment for neural networks and a huge amount of data that she can collect from the growing Tesla fleet. While her cars explore roads, the software of these cars is under her control. Others make a safer bet. They believe that the expected breakthrough will not happen soon, while cheap lidar is more predictable and is already on the way to production.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Even when computer vision is of a decent standard, many will still decide to use cheap lidar, which will still be on the market by then. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The advantages of lidar will never be reduced to zero, and its 100% reliability practically does not require compromises. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, you can drive while looking at the road with just one eye through a monochrome filter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But you do not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maybe you would refuse security in order to save a lot of money, but not in order to save only a small amount.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Camera Distance Measurement</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The main value of lidar is reliable and accurate distance determination. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Computer vision systems can undermine this value. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A recent </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">study by Cornell University</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, which was published by Tesla's Autonomy Day, received special attention. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People mistakenly believed that it was announcing a solution to the problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the document reports an accuracy of around 70% when deriving depth values ​​of up to about 30 meters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lidars reach 100% depth with a range of 100 to 300m depending on the type of lidar. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This level of range is critical for highway driving. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">30 meters is far from enough for city driving. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tesla in its presentation showed two useful methods for determining distance using neural networks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She used the holy grail of machine learning - uncontrolled learning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will be interesting to see the results that she will publish.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Computer vision "decides"</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Computer vision, which provides the same information as lidar, is a very high bar. Not so long ago it would be difficult to find a person who considers this possible. Now there are such people, the same Musk, but most people still believe that it is very difficult. Tesla hopes that the sheer amount of data received from cars from their fleet is the secret ingredient to their future success. If so, the Tesla autopilot proves that they have a long way to go. The Tesla autopilot is a screen that displays visual perception data. Anyone who uses it knows that it is still pretty inaccurate. All this trouble with computer vision is not so necessary to get a working autopilot. The bottom line is nine.You need to go a long way from 99% accuracy (which is already a decent system to facilitate driving) to 99.99999% accuracy, which you trust your life.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is this a crutch?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If you describe the essence of the dispute in a few words, Musk believes that for safe driving we need a magnificent, almost perfect computer vision that can fulfill all the functions of a lidar. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Others believe that you can drive safely using lidar reliability and very good computer vision. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Musk believes that everyone is mistaken and that lidar is a crutch that makes people content with “very good” quality. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Which is better - an almost perfect computer vision without lidar or an almost perfect (within its limits) lidar with very good computer vision? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is the question.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Others, by the way, believe that Tesla has its own crutch and this is a driver assistance system. Tesla is arguably the best driver assistance system. The company is going to improve its system until it is 100% good. Many consider this a mistake, in their opinion it is better to abandon the legacy of the driver assistance system and aim to achieve success from scratch. If Tesla chooses an improved driver assistance system, it will face many limitations. This idea may not work. That is why many consider this a bad idea. Sterling Anderson, a former Tesla Autopilot executive and current product director at Aurora, likes to call his former employer's approach an attempt to reach the moon by building a staircase higher. (Elon Musk knows a little about how to get to the moon.)</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most car manufacturers who are faced with a driver assistance system prefer a more gradual approach.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Killer example</font></font></h3><br>
<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last week, Tesla was sued for a fatal accident</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that clearly shows the difference between the two approaches. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first such incident occurred in Florida, which once again confirms the danger of Tesla's approach. </font></font><br>
<br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cf/a8e/b2f/1cfa8eb2fabea85058b3c85114bcc81e.jpg" alt="image"><br>
<br>
<i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">View of the scene of a car accident with autopilot at night. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note that the triangular section at the fork of the road looks like a strip, but the dull lines on the right blurred the edge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The chipper, which is now restored in the photo, is obvious to the human eye, but not to computer vision.</font></font></i><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Probably during an accident, Tesla algorithms did not correctly recognize the road signs and drove into the lane that was between the road and the exit. The car drove right into the chipper, killing the driver. With the current level of Tesla technology, such situations are possible. The accident occurred because neither the radar nor the computer vision recognized the bump. I repeat, at the moment, such situations are possible. The radar could recognize the chipper only as a stationary object. Radar systems cannot determine exactly where the object is, and you cannot slow down every time your radar reports a stationary object along the way.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
More importantly, computer vision could not recognize the chipper. The probability is high that it is simply not trained to detect chippers, in particular the one into which the victim crashed; 11 days before the accident, the driver of a regular car crashed into this chipper. Neural networks can identify only those things that they have been trained to define or something similar to them. Tesla neural networks are well trained to spot the back of any vehicle. They were trained to identify certain types of objects on the road, but probably in 2018 they were not yet taught to identify bumpers. Therefore, the car continued to drive and, even worse, accelerated, as it decided that a new lane was open to it. Unfortunately, adaptive cruise control often does this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Lidar would almost certainly have identified this chipper. Lidar would almost certainly have identified a truck driving onto the road that killed Tesla driver Joshua Brown in Florida. The autopilot directed the car right into the truck. Lidar does not need to understand what kind of object is in front of him in order to calculate the distance to it and its dimensions. Good lidars / software better understand what an obstacle is in front of them. They are combined with computer vision to improve understanding. The result of the joint work of lidar and computer vision is much better than the work of computer vision alone.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I say “almost certainly” because software that processes the lidar image can make mistakes. In 2017, this led to the death of Uber. Their lidar saw the victim, but obviously the image processing system made a number of serious and unexpected mistakes in determining who it was and where it was going. As soon as the victim appeared in front of the vehicle, the car correctly reacted and decided to brake; why in the end the car continued to move </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">is another story</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Most developers see people dying when they use the first between using only computer vision and its combination with lidar. Therefore, they do not support the point of view of Tesla. Maybe on some day the difference between these decisions will cease to exist.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
While Tesla is trying to move from a car with a driver assistance system to a robocar, while others are trying to create a robocar right away, it is Tesla that is counting on a breakthrough in computer vision. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rest are just trying to improve what already works.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cards</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Tesla also excelled in the use of detailed maps. </font></font><a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u="><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This has already been discussed in previous articles</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and will be the topic of my new article. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It should be noted that the fatal accident described above probably would not have occurred if more accurate maps showed the correct geometry of the road. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The chipper would have been on the map, and a car with such a card would have traveled around him, regardless of whether she saw him or not.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What if Tesla are wrong?</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Tesla bet can pay off. An investor who wants to maintain a portfolio of his shares may want to own both Waymo (if he can) and Tesla. Diversification of investments is the right strategy for any reasonable investor.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Tesla set a high bar, but there are a few safety precautions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if Tesla soon fails to solve the problem of fully self-driving cars, they still have a big electric car business. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They have a clear leadership in terms of electric trains and high-tech car designs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, their car with an autopilot will not be able to drive from coast to coast when there is nobody in the car. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, he will not be able to carry you around the city while you sleep. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But Tesla's autopilot products will continue to introduce new, great features. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are things that can be solved much easier and it is not necessary to use lidar for this:</font></font><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">parking</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the ability to monitor the status of traffic jams while you type an email</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">operations that allow you to deliver the car to the gas station at low speed late at night (later in the day)</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">freeway on the freeway (first deserted, then more busy)</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">low speed operations in limited, preapproved areas</font></font></li>
<li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">improvement of the driver assistance system, reducing the possibility of an accident to zero</font></font></li>
</ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
All this, of course, is not as cool as a robocar, but no less useful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tesla may be the first to make part of these features. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(Some car manufacturers already have automated traffic control.) </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If Tesla steps on her throat and admits that she needs a lidar, she will have to change her car design. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On current Tesla machines there is no room for a lidar with low drag. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps the front lidar can be difficult to put next to cameras and rear-view mirrors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, the lidar should be less than now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The front lidar is the most important in terms of safety.</font></font><br>
<br>
<h3>,  Tesla ?</h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
People who study this issue make a common mistake - they do not take into account that other companies do not invest all their energy in lidar. Some companies, like Tesla, are enthusiastic about computer vision and neural networks. They just want to combine this technology with lidar and they have money to work on both. An important competitor is Waymo, a relative of Google through Alphabet. Almost everyone agrees that Google leads the way in neural networks. People who have shown us a new way to work with deep neural networks, such as Jeffrey Hinton, work for Google. The neural networks that defeated the world champion in the game of Go gave us Google. Waimo has access to all of this. They also have access to Google’s TPU neural network processors. Although Musk said their neural network chip is the best in the world, it is not.Google’s TPU is better and no one except Waymo has access to it. This is normal, many Silicon Valley startups are now working on the “world's best chip” for the neural network. You will see many of them in 2019-2020. Nvidia's GPUs are currently superior to the Tesla chip, but consume more power.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If it becomes clear that lidar is not needed, Waymo and several other companies will have to enter the game. They do not have a Tesla fleet, but there are ways to get these resources, sometimes at great expense. Tesla skillfully makes customers pay for the ability to collect data and conduct testing for them. Uber and Lyft have even more drivers who can do this for Tesla.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
If lidar really becomes unnecessary, as Musk predicts, Tesla will have an advantage, but not one hundred percent. Musk must also make sure that his other bets will pay off. He promotes driving without detailed maps (I will discuss this later) and the use of machine learning to make tactical decisions, for example, when you need to decide which lane to use at the intersection. He is also not a fan of simulation: Tesla uses it, but not as actively as Waymo and other companies. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As your Tesla software develops, you may need to change the sensor settings. There are places near the car that the cameras cannot see. Also, Tesla does not have wipers on the side and rear cameras, which are needed in case of severe weather.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Lidar fans do not rule out the possibility of using neural networks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They use them to understand the data received from the lidar, just as they would use them to process data from the camera. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(They are also used with radar data.)
