<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
We continue to share with you the stories of young people whom we help to find ourselves in the field of banking IT. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of last year, we wrote that we were opening a school for Java developers in Nizhny Novgorod. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the applications, we selected 25 people, and according to the results of training the five best students we took to our IT team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How are their working days now - read under the cut.</font></font><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now I am studying in the specialty ‚ÄúInformation Security of Telecommunication Networks‚Äù at NNSU named after </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lobachevsky, but I became interested in programming in high school. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In high school, I started looking for a job with the opportunity to engage in really interesting projects in the field of software development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was necessary to determine the language. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I chose Java because </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this language is used in large companies that pay special attention to reliability and security - I always wanted to join in the development of large and complex systems, apply the theoretical knowledge gained at the university. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On hh, I learned about Rosbank's Java school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was attracted to the training program and the prospect of employment.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
During training, we had a cool practice mentor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He clearly told the theory, and we also had a lot of practice and work on real tasks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over 90 hours of training, we became acquainted with the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù of development: JavaCore, Spring Framework, Hibenate, PostgreSQL, etc. But, what's the most cool, after defending the final project, I was hired by Rosbank. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Now I work at the Competence Development Center for EDMS and portal solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to school, I feel confident and am developing a backend for internal projects of the bank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The work is interesting and very versatile, which only fuels interest and desire to develop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I also want to note the working conditions: a comfortable office, a wonderful team lead and a team.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cyril, Java developer</font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_u/gm/sn/_ugmsnyif6h5azjk6co0n023l4s.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I began to study programming at 11 years old. After graduating from the physical and mathematical lyceum, I went to study in St. Petersburg as an IT specialist. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In the fall of 2019, at the job fair, he learned about Rosbank's Java school. Interest in Java was caused by the fact that it is an infrastructure-developed programming language. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
At the stage of selection, I did not think that I would pass - the questions were difficult. As a result, I was among the 25 best students who were taken to school. In the first lesson, the teacher gave us good advice: next month to forget about everything except Java, and promised that we will remember learning for a long time.</font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Separately, I want to note the training program: in a short time I managed to completely immerse myself in Java. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The brain was boiling. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the evening, a lecture, and the next day we are already starting to put the same material into practice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We also had to learn how to present the results of our work to business representatives. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a very important skill. </font></font><br>
 <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Learning was difficult, sometimes I even thought about giving up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, I reached the finals, created a graduation project and got a job. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I am engaged in the development of microservices for internal use at Rosbank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Very like.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yana, Java Developer</font></font></h3><br>

<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
My interest in programming appeared at school. When it came time to apply to the university, I knew for sure that I wanted to become a developer. After studying at the university, I realized that I had gained a lot of fundamental knowledge, but there was not enough practice. I wanted to get more development experience on real cases. Before that, I already independently studied the next programming language from scratch, but now it was interesting to do new projects, having feedback from the teacher. At that moment I found out about Rosbank‚Äôs Java school and thought: ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs exactly what I need!‚Äù</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Schooling was as intense as possible: an incredible amount of new information and homework. Sometimes it was very difficult. Was it worth it? Definitely. For a short period of training, we received a tremendous amount of knowledge professionally filed by the teacher. All tasks for independent execution were as close as possible to real ones. After graduation, I felt ready to start working as a Java developer.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I like to work at Rosbank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Very comfortable office, no dress code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I work in a department that develops applications for internal use by bank employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is very cool - I know that I make the necessary and convenient programs for people working next to me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I'm developing a web service using Spring. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I work in a great team - at any time, senior colleagues can help with difficult questions.</font></font><br>
 <br>
<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander, Java developer</font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_t/yj/yg/_tyjygtsnh0wwr_vw1qdus1wj0c.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I graduated from the Faculty of Engineering and Physics, then worked for a specialty for 2.5 years and realized that I had hit the ceiling. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He began to think about further professional development and remembered that since childhood he had been staring at programming. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the advice of his older comrades, he chose Java. </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
He learned about the Rosbank Java school on the hh portal and decided to try his hand. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The training turned out to be quite dense: 6 weeks of concentrated qualitative (very important) theory and practice, homework and graduation project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Separately, it is worth noting the course teacher and certainly a professional in his field - Ilnaz Gilyazov.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I like my work at Rosbank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I am involved in the development of a service for processing internal applications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The project is interesting and architecturally complex, but fortunately colleagues and senior comrades are happy to help in contentious situations.</font></font><br>

<h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Roman, backend developer</font></font></h3><br>
<img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gh/o2/tr/gho2trx63ibhmhse0_bwcwqu2qs.jpeg" alt="image"><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
I graduated from the undergraduate university. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lobachevsky in the direction of "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After completing the 4th year, I started looking for a job, and I saw an advertisement for a Java school. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I thought it would be a good experience, as they promised a lot of practice (it was). </font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The training lasted a month and a half, and during this time I realized that I really like it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For myself, I decided that I definitely want to get to Rosbank, and tried to do my best to achieve this.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As a result, I successfully completed training, defended the project and got into the development team of Rosbank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I got an excellent team lead that will explain and help in any situation and my colleagues are close to me in spirit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My first project was to create an AOP shell to synchronize two applications with each other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This project allowed me to better understand the backend development.</font></font></div>
