						<h2 class="first">Recommendation</h2>
					
				<div class="recommendation" itemprop="reviewBody">
					<p>Ruth Beckford brings a lifetime of experience and accumulated wisdom to this book of affirmations and short essays aimed at "women in the second half of life." Topics, which touch on professional and personal issues, include empowerment, health, romance and inner peace. Although this book contains the same philosophies found in virtually every other self-help or inspirational book, its focus on how these thoughts apply to women at midlife and beyond sets it apart. <em>BooksInShort.com</em> recommends this book to those women - at least to the ones who, with their booming careers, adolescent or adult kids, aging parents, active spouses and an occasional night at the theater - still have time to read. Just one criticism, though: These lovely aphorisms have a slight whiff of retirement about them, a faint fragrance that makes us wonder a bit if the author fully understands that 50 isn’t quite as old as it used to be.</p>

			<div class="abstractText ">
				<h3>Groovin’ as Long as You Live</h3><p>No matter how old you are, you can still enjoy all of life’s wonders. Life isn’t just for people younger than 45, no matter what you may think and no matter how much entertainment and the media push for youth-driven culture. You’re "still groovin’" for as long as you live. Remind yourself of that by taking these affirmations to heart.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>Did you know that you could get a free face-lift simply by smiling? Try this affirmation: "A smile softens my wrinkles because it lifts my disposition. I will get a free face-lift today by smiling - and smiling often."</p><blockquote>“As far as I know, nothing moves in time from old age to newborn.”</blockquote><p>Your health depends upon many physical, emotional and spiritual factors. Pamper yourself, practice patience, remember that you are a survivor - you’ve been healed before and you will be healed again. Listen to your body. It can tell you the truth about your health, well being and state of mind. Your body knows what is best. Pace yourself. Try these affirmations for better emotional and physical health:</p><ul><li>Like the redwood trees, I grow more beautiful with age. My core is strong.</li><li>I project an inner peace and strength that are the gifts of time.</li><li>I love my body and pledge to take good care of it every day.</li><li>I breathe deep and stretch, and I feel great.</li><li>I will address any fear or embarrassment that threatens to shrink my world.</li><li>Peace is mine when I make plans for my medical coverage.</li><li>Hugging assures my emotional well being.</li><li>We are what we consume, so we will practice moderation.</li></ul><h3>Empowerment</h3><p>Women older than 45 were raised in an era that was kinder and gentler. People lived in real communities and knew their neighbors. Many participated in an extended family of related and not-related aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers and cousins. Children were taught to share and help one another. This more cooperative lifestyle was a great asset, though those pre-liberation days also had a darker side, especially for women.</p><blockquote>“Health is your most valuable possession, and it’s priceless. Poor folks can be rich in health, and millionaires can be paupers.”</blockquote><p>Today, women who work outside the home are still the primary caretakers of their homes and families, whether they are married or not. Without close friends, neighbors and family, this can be a tremendous burden. Women still tend to neglect themselves and their own needs and have a very difficult time saying no.</p><blockquote>“Do you know people who are worrywarts? They worry about real things - and not-so-real things. They worry about what-ifs. I sometimes think they invent situations to worry about. When they have a worry-free day, they worry that they are not worrying.”</blockquote><p>Your life is to be enjoyed and it’s time to serve yourself, not just others. Work through the guilt - it will pass. Be daring, be adventurous.</p><p><b>Try these affirmations:</b></p><ul><li>I will celebrate what is best for me in each decade.</li><li>I welcome new experiences, new words, new relationships and new opportunities for self-empowerment.</li><li>From this day forward, I will be honest about my feelings.</li><li>My knowledge puts me ahead of being threatened by youth.</li><li>I will give a problem - or a worry - my best thinking, and then I will let it go.</li><li>I will celebrate honesty by saying what I mean and by honoring commitments.</li><li>The early part of life got me ready for the adventure of the last part.</li><li>My good thoughts will convert to good feelings and health.</li><li>I will celebrate my birthday with style every year, and I will help other women celebrate their birthdays as well.</li><li>Now I have the courage to dig up secret ambitions and pursue them.</li><li>I will realize my dreams by making plans and taking action; finishing each step gives me a boost because I no longer have time for procrastination.</li><li>I will look in the mirror each day to see my intentions and denials - and how I can grow by addressing my problems courageously.</li><li>I’ll be as good to myself as I am to my best friend.</li><li>I won’t take myself so seriously anymore.</li></ul><h3>Bed Rules</h3><p>Think about getting your "Ph.D. in rest." You don’t have to be swirling in activity all the time. Take time for yourself to relax, think, read, watch a movie, listen to music, whatever you want to do... in bed. Here are the rules:</p><ol><li value="1">Get over feeling guilty about being in bed during the day.</li><li value="2">You must be organized to accrue free time. You get no "bed points" if you’re in bed thinking about what you should be doing. Only a clear conscience is allowed in bed.</li><li value="3">Even if you have only one hour, grab one hour of bed rest.</li><li value="4">Get out of binding clothes. No restriction of blood vessels is allowed. No bras, belts, pantyhose, or jewelry.</li><li value="5">Resting in a chair doesn’t count. Only resting in bed counts.</li><li value="6">Rest is not sleep, but body rest.</li><li value="7">Don’t think of rest as wasted time. It’s healing time.</li><li value="8">You can turn on the radio, music or TV if the silence scares you.</li><li value="9">If you can, work in bed.</li><li value="10">The goal is for your body to slow down. </li></ol><h3>Romance</h3><p>The incidence of separation, divorce and widowhood increase after age 45. It can be difficult to adjust from being part of a couple to being alone. It feels like you’re starting all over again. While disappointment in a relationship can make you cautious about future romance, you will find that after your initial grief and anger subside, your newfound freedom can open up all kinds of new possibilities. Many women choose not to marry again; instead they’re comfortable having casual relationships. But plenty of women spend the second half of life attempting to recover what they believe they have lost. Contrary to what popular culture would like us to believe, romance and love aren’t just for the young.</p><blockquote>“I’ll never stop growing, regardless of my age.”</blockquote><p>Those over 45, including seniors, can be as vital as those half their age. Love and sex get better with age. Whether you are in a relationship or not, the following affirmations will give you a fresh perspective:</p><ul><li>My romantic spirit never ages.</li><li>I will remember to tell my mate that I love him, and I will show my love.</li><li>I am open to relationships with all kinds of people, even those who are younger.</li><li>I’ll take a risk because I have nothing to lose.</li><li>A tidal wave of love can start with a ripple.</li><li>I see myself as sexy and I have a sexy attitude.</li><li>I will continue to nurture my female friendships. Men may come and go, but girlfriends are forever.</li><li>I will enter relationships on steady feet.</li><li>I will have safe sex.</li><li>I won’t date a person who just wants a caretaker.</li><li>I’ll have the courage to end any relationship that gives me no joy.</li><li>I will socialize.</li></ul><h3>Inner Peace</h3><p>Your life experiences have prompted you to reexamine yourself, your philosophies and beliefs. You have become your own best leader. Now is the time to seek balance, to cultivate whatever brings you inner peace. Letting go of old baggage allows you to quit wasting all the energy you were using to carry it and use your strength instead for productive, life-enhancing feelings and activities. Lighten your load by leaving behind old hurts and anger.</p><blockquote>“I’ll live each day with passion, compassion and love.”</blockquote><p>Peace of mind isn’t possible until you are willing to value inner peace over and above everything else within your spirit. Get rid of that little negative voice in your head that can be so nasty, judgmental (of you and others), fearful and ultimately soul-destroying. Try these affirmations for peace of mind:</p><ul><li>My mind is a powerful magnet that attracts only good to my life.</li><li>Before sleeping, I’ll count my blessings.</li><li>I forgive others, and myself and I avoid anger and revenge.</li><li>I’m rich when my mind deposits good thoughts.</li><li>I cannot change anyone else.</li><li>I live every day as though it’s my last.</li><li>I know that divine guidance has good plans for me.</li><li>I live each day with passion, compassion and love.</li><li>Nothing can keep me down for long.</li><li>I accept change with an open heart and mind.</li><li>I will find time to do an act of kindness.</li><li>I’ll lighten my load by giving things away.</li></ul><blockquote>“I accept change with an open heart and mind.”</blockquote><p>When you were younger, you put out a large net to catch whatever you could, as much as you could. But, now, with experience you have developed discernment and patience. Now, you want only the best, only the good.</p><h3>Uplifting Words</h3><p>With age and experience comes your own personal wisdom: you know yourself better than ever. These sayings will further your growth and lift your spirit:</p><ul><li>When you’re casual about life, you’ll end up a casualty.</li><li>Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.</li><li>What great achievement has been performed by someone who said it couldn’t be done?</li><li>If you stand for nothing, you’ll fall for anything.</li><li>If you aim at nothing, you’ll hit it every time.</li><li>If something knocks you down, land on your back - if you can look up, you can get up.</li><li>You can’t soar like an eagle if you’re running around with pigeons.</li><li>Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.</li><li>If you like what you’ve been getting, keep doing what you’ve been doing.</li><li>Periodic self-pampering is profitable.</li></ul><blockquote>“Experience teaches that ”this too shall pass.’”</blockquote><p>After you’ve done everything you can, turn your problems over to divine guidance. Divine timing brings together what is needed. This approach will bring you not only solutions seemingly out of thin air or coincidence, but also plenty of relief and inner peace.</p>
