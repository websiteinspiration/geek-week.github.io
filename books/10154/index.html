					<p>Stephen Hawking‚Äôs first edition of this book came out in 1988. It sold more than 10 million copies, but you might hesitate to try reading it, given the book‚Äôs universal ambition. Now, you can pick up this abbreviated, accessible revision with pleasure and anticipation. Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow smoothly explain the most profound questions about the physical world. They illustrate their points with brief stories, analogies and a cluster of images. The result is a compressed introduction to science, physics and cosmology, with sketches of key historical points. Even with clear explanations, the conceptual density can be challenging. Still, it‚Äôs the best explanation out there. <em>BooksInShort</em> recommends this highly readable tour through the universe‚Äôs most compelling mysteries.</p>

					Summary
				</h2>
			
			<div class="abstractText ">
				<h3>Look Up in Wonder</h3><p>Looking at the distant, mysterious stars raises the same questions that your ancient ancestors asked: ‚ÄúWhere did the universe come from? Where is it going?‚Äù Is there a beginning and will there be an end? What is space and what is time?</p><p>As recently as 500 years ago, you could ‚Äúfind people who thought the earth was flat.‚Äù Citizens of ancient Greece observed how ships appeared over the horizon a bit at a time. They concluded this fit a round world better than a flat one, on which the entire ship would be visible but very small. The Greeks noted that some lights in the sky moved differently than others. Most followed regular paths; a few doubled back. The Greeks called them ‚Äúwanderers.‚Äù They were the planets.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe eventual goal of science is to provide a single theory that describes the whole universe.‚Äù</blockquote><p>The ancients constructed models to explain celestial movements. Aristotle argued for a stationary Earth around which the stars and other objects ‚Äúmoved in circular orbits.‚Äù Ptolemy posited a model of the universe as nested, moving spheres. The stars were stationary on these spheres, but the planets moved, thus explaining their wandering. This flawed model was ‚Äúfairly accurate‚Äù at predicting celestial motion. In 1514, Nicolaus Copernicus argued that the planets moved around the sun, not the Earth. Most people rejected this truer model for another 100 years, until Johannes Kepler‚Äôs and Galileo Galilei‚Äôs observations gave it weight. In 1687, Isaac Newton explained why the planets moved around the sun in his <em>Principia</em>, ‚Äúthe most important single work ever published in the physical sciences.‚Äù Newton articulated the laws of motion, identified and named gravity, and explained the math that governed it.</p><h3>Scientific Theory and Fact</h3><p>To discuss the great questions of the universe, you need to understand ‚Äúwhat a scientific theory is.‚Äù Scientific theories provide models of the universe. They come with ‚Äúa set of rules‚Äù about how aspects of the model relate to what you see in the physical world. Good theories ‚Äúaccurately describe‚Äù many observations and let you make ‚Äúdefinite predictions‚Äù about what you will observe. Empedocles theorized that the world was made up of ‚Äúfour elements: earth, air, fire and water.‚Äù However, his notions did not let Aristotle make any predictions and so they do not qualify as scientific theory. ‚ÄúNewton‚Äôs theory of gravity‚Äù was even simpler. It argued that all physical objects attract one another, based on a specific force determined by their mass and the distance between them. This single theory enables highly accurate predictions about celestial movement.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúWe live in a strange and wonderful universe. Its age, size, violence and beauty require extraordinary imagination to appreciate.‚Äù</blockquote><p>All scientific theories are ‚Äúprovisional.‚Äù No one can prove them out, no matter how many experiments show confirming results. A single contradicting observation can disprove a theory. The more times a theory has been confirmed, the more people trust it. New theories often extend and modify existing theories, but don‚Äôt disprove them. Consider Albert Einstein‚Äôs and Newton‚Äôs theories. Newton‚Äôs theories predicted the planet Mercury would move one way; Einstein‚Äôs theories predicted a slightly different motion, which observations confirmed. Despite this confirmation, Newton‚Äôs theories continue to have wide acceptance because they describe most of the situations people encounter, and are easier concepts to grasp and utilize.</p><h3>Galileo and Newton</h3><p>Galileo played a larger role than any other person in creating ‚Äúmodern science.‚Äù He was one of the first thinkers to argue that humans could ‚Äúunderstand how the world works‚Äù by observing nature. He suffered the Catholic Church‚Äôs Inquisition and arrest for his ideas. He helped provide an alternative to the dominant Aristotelian model of the physical world, which argued that objects had natural states of being ‚Äúat rest,‚Äù and that things moved only if something else forced them to. In this model, heavier objects should fall faster than lighter ones. Galileo demonstrated this was incorrect by rolling ‚Äúballs of different weight down a smooth slope.‚Äù The balls increased their speed by the same rate, regardless of their size.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúOur present ideas about the motion of bodies date back to Galileo and Newton.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Newton built on these observations for his ‚Äúlaws of motion.‚Äù Newton‚Äôs first law argued that any object that does not experience some outside force would keep going ‚Äúin a straight line at the same speed.‚Äù His second law said if an outside force does interact with objects, the objects would change their speed at a rate ‚Äúproportional to that force.‚Äù Newton articulated a theory of gravity that identified a specific equation: Objects attract one another ‚Äúwith a force proportional to the mass‚Äù of each. Newton showed that gravity grows weaker as two objects grow farther apart.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúGalileo, perhaps more than any other single person, was responsible for the birth of modern science.‚Äù</blockquote><p>A key distinction between the Aristotelian and the Galilean/Newtonian model is that ‚ÄúAristotle believed in a preferred state of rest.‚Äù Thus, the Earth is ‚Äúat rest‚Äù or stationary. Newton‚Äôs laws demonstrate that no such state exists. This distinction matters, because it leads to the conclusion that the universe has no ‚Äúabsolute standard of rest.‚Äù This holds tremendous implications for physics, because it negates the idea of ‚Äúabsolute position.‚Äù Observers can see things differently in the physical world and never resolve their differences. Aristotle and Newton agreed on a single ‚Äúabsolute time‚Äù that scientists could measure; this belief lasted until the 20th century.</p><h3>Living in Einstein‚Äôs Universe</h3><p>Understanding light is central to understanding Einstein‚Äôs theories of relativity. As early as 1676, astronomical observations of Jupiter‚Äôs moons led to the recognition that light has a ‚Äúfinite but very high speed.‚Äù In 1865, physicist James Clerk Maxwell articulated ‚ÄúMaxwell‚Äôs theory‚Äù of ‚Äúthe propagation of light.‚Äù His equations unified the ‚Äúpartial theories‚Äù that previously explained magnetism and electricity. He showed that ‚Äúwavelike disruptions‚Äù move through electromagnetic fields, and he calculated that they traveled at the speed of light. This speed was fixed ‚Äì that appeared to contradict Newton‚Äôs position that ‚Äúthere is no absolute standard of rest.‚Äù To reconcile these theories, scientists introduced the idea of the ‚Äúether,‚Äù a hypothetical substance that filled apparently empty space as light waves moved through it. In 1877, the ‚ÄúMichelson-Morley experiment‚Äù disproved the existence of the ether by observing light moving at uniform speeds independent of the Earth‚Äôs position. Science needed a new answer.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúEinstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity is based on the revolutionary suggestion that gravity is not a force like other forces but a consequence of the fact that space-time is not flat, as had been previously assumed.‚Äù</blockquote><p>In 1905, Einstein demonstrated that you didn‚Äôt need the idea of the ether if you were willing to give up ‚Äúthe idea of absolute time.‚Äù His ‚Äútheory of relativity‚Äù indicated that scientific law governs everything, including Maxwell‚Äôs theory. ‚ÄúAccording to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.‚Äù This seems straightforward, but carries profound implications. Space and time are no longer separate, but instead are part of a single unified concept of ‚Äúspace-time.‚Äù Rather than occurring at a specific and absolute time, events in time are similar to those in space. As you can describe the position of any object in space with three coordinates, so you identify the position of an event in space-time with four coordinates.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúIn order to talk about the nature of the universe and to discuss such questions as whether it has a beginning or an end, you have to be clear about what a scientific theory is.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Relativity also established an equivalency between ‚Äúmass and energy,‚Äù as summed up in Einstein‚Äôs famous equation ‚ÄúE=mc<sup>2</sup>.‚Äù In this equation, ‚Äú<em>E</em> is energy, <em>m</em> is mass and <em>c </em>is the speed of light.‚Äù However, this theory of ‚Äúspecial relativity‚Äù contradicts Newton‚Äôs assumptions on gravity. Einstein did not address this point until 1913.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúIt is possible to travel to the future. That is, relativity shows that it is possible to create a time machine that will jump you forward in time.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Einstein‚Äôs theory shifted the scientific understanding of gravity. It postulated that instead of being a force like magnetism, gravity was a product of the fact that space-time is curved: The energy and mass distributed within it warps it. This general theory of ‚Äúrelativity predicts that gravitational fields should bend light,‚Äù as a United Kingdom expedition in Africa observed in 1919. General relativity also predicts that time runs at different rates depending on the proximity to mass: If you are closer to the Earth‚Äôs surface, time runs more slowly than if you are far above it. These theoretical shifts fundamentally changed humanity‚Äôs understanding of the physical universe.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúAccording to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Before Einstein, you could regard the universe as unchanging. Things happened in it, but events did not fundamentally affect the objective universe of space or time. Now, both time and space are perceived as ‚Äúdynamic qualities.‚Äù When an object moves, it changes how space and time curve, and this curvature changes how things move and act. Because Einstein‚Äôs theories eliminate the idea of absolute time or space, they open the door to intriguing possibilities, such as building time machines and using ‚Äúwormholes‚Äù ‚Äì shortcuts in space ‚Äì to reduce drastically the immense distances space travel requires.</p><h3>An ‚ÄúExpanding Universe‚Äù of Wonders </h3><p>The Earth‚Äôs sun is part of a rotating spiral galaxy, the Milky Way. In 1924, astronomer Edwin Hubble demonstrated that the Milky Way is one of many galaxies and that tremendous tracts of ‚Äúempty space‚Äù separate the galaxies.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúWith the advent of quantum mechanics, we have come to recognize that events cannot be predicted with complete accuracy: there is always a degree of uncertainty.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Hubble calculated the distance to these galaxies indirectly. He found similar stars in distant galaxies and estimated their distance based on their luminosity. When something glows, it emits a specific spectrum of light according to how hot it is. Starting in the 1920s, astronomers studying stellar spectra noticed that some colors they expected to see were missing. The light had ‚Äúshifted toward the red end of the spectrum‚Äù because the stars move away from Earth. The farther away a galaxy, the more red-shifted its light appears from Earth. That means that the more distant a galaxy, the faster it is moving away. The entire ‚Äúuniverse is expanding.‚Äù</p><blockquote>‚ÄúBecause theories are always being changed to account for new observations, they are never properly digested or simplified so that ordinary people can understand them.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Will the universe continue to expand? Will it stop and collapse back on itself? Or will expansion slow to a near stop? If you run the expansion backward, you get a highly compressed universe and a point where time as we know it began ‚Äì the Big Bang. By one second after the Big Bang, the universe‚Äôs temperature dropped ‚Äúto about 10 billion degrees Celsius.‚Äù The particles in the universe had ‚Äúso much energy‚Äù that collisions between them produced many pairs of particles and antiparticles. One hundred seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature dropped to about one billion degrees, cool enough for atomic nuclei to form. These atoms are comprised of smaller ‚Äúelementary particles‚Äù: ‚Äúelectrons, protons and neutrons,‚Äù which are in turn made up of ‚Äúsmaller particles called quarks.‚Äù</p><blockquote>‚ÄúAny physical theory is always provisional...it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Scientific understanding advanced so markedly and was so successful in explaining the universe that some 19th-century thinkers said ‚Äúthe universe was completely deterministic.‚Äù The Marquis de LaPlace held that if you knew the ‚Äúcomplete state of the universe at any one time,‚Äù understanding natural laws would let you predict everything else that would happen. This model was popular in the scientific world until the start of the 20th century, when analyses of how it would explain stellar radiation led to the conclusion that a star would have to radiate infinite energy.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúIt turns out to be very difficult to devise a theory to describe the universe all in one go.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Max Planck proposed an alternative model of light, saying that radiating bodies could emit energy only ‚Äúin certain discrete packets,‚Äù or ‚Äúquanta.‚Äù One quantum of light is a ‚Äúphoton.‚Äù Quantum physics works in terms of probabilities, not Newtonian certainties, thus introducing a constant element of randomness. ‚ÄúWith the advent of quantum mechanics, we have come to recognize that events cannot be predicted with complete accuracy: there is always a degree of uncertainty.‚Äù</p><h3>Fundamental Forces</h3><p>Contemporary physics seeks a ‚Äúcomplete unified theory of the universe.‚Äù Any successful unified theory must integrate the fundamental forces governing interactions between particles. Science has identified four of these forces:</p><ul><li><b>‚ÄúGravity‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Gravity is a ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù force: All particles feel it by ‚Äúmass or energy.‚Äù Although ‚Äúgravity acts over great distances,‚Äù it is by far the weakest of the four forces.</li><li><b>Electromagnetism</b> ‚Äì ‚ÄúElectromagnetic force‚Äù affects only charged particles, like quarks or electrons: It does not affect ‚Äúuncharged particles‚Äù like neutrinos. Electromagnetic force, which is 10<sup>42</sup> times stronger than gravity, exists in two forms: positive and negative charges. Two positives repulse one another, as do two negatives. In large objects, the positive and negative charges are roughly balanced. </li><li><b>‚ÄúWeak nuclear force‚Äù</b> ‚Äì You encounter gravity and electromagnetism daily, but not this third force. Weak nuclear force is responsible for ‚Äúthe decay of atomic nuclei.‚Äù </li><li><b>‚ÄúStrong nuclear force‚Äù </b>‚Äì This strongest force operates invisibly in daily life. It holds quarks together within neutrons and protons. Without it, the repulsion between positively charged protons within nuclei would blow apart every atom above the size of the hydrogen atom ‚Äì which has only one proton.</li></ul>
