					Summary
				</h2>
			
			<div class="abstractText ">
				<h3>The Value of Intellectual Capital</h3><p>In most organizations, senior managers and learning professionals speak different languages. Many senior executives don‚Äôt understand learning. Others merely pay lip service to the importance of workplace learning but seldom support it. Fewer still credit workplace learning for making a genuine substantial contribution to organizational success. Some executives even believe, incorrectly, that employees should be responsible for their own professional development. Such retrograde thinking persists even in today‚Äôs knowledge economy.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe balanced scorecard...clearly demonstrates how intangible efforts such as organizational learning contribute to the organization‚Äôs goals.‚Äù</blockquote><p>However, this is a curable situation. To demonstrate the value of your learning programs in meeting corporate goals, including profitability, implement a balanced scorecard tracking and evaluation system. The balanced scorecard (BSC) is a good tool for gathering, assessing and presenting information that proves how quality staff development programming leads to better products, sales, service and profits.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúWorkplace learning is a way to ensure that every employee is capable of working with the organization to achieve its strategic objectives.‚Äù</blockquote><p>The same executives who don‚Äôt understand what your learning program is accomplishing probably revere famous corporate learning organizations, such as General Electric, Google and Apple. The leaders of those prominent corporations understand that employee knowledge is a pivotal organizational asset, in fact, a major chunk of their intellectual capital. High-tech companies aren‚Äôt the only firms that value information. Throughout history, many famous organizations have profitably leveraged their employees‚Äô knowledge. For example, Henry Ford drew on his workers‚Äô knowledge to develop popular innovations, including Ford Motor Company‚Äôs famous assembly line. Today, a company‚Äôs competitive edge and its value often rest on its workforce‚Äôs skills and knowledge, the modern economy‚Äôs most essential components.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúOne of the most challenging aspects of organizational learning is attempting to measure and value its contribution to the organization.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Because workplace learning enables outstanding performance, many corporate educators now call their field ‚Äúworkplace learning and performance,‚Äù or WLP, and they call themselves WLP professionals.</p><h3>An Uphill Climb</h3><p>To earn recognition and validation from the highest levels of their companies, WLP professionals must discover, think through and act on their top executives‚Äô goal- and profit-oriented perspectives. This means tying your learning initiatives directly to your firm‚Äôs strategic objectives, and informing managers about the benefits of this aligned programming. To strengthen upper-management support and middle-management participation, demonstrate the value that learning creates in the following business functions:</p><ul><li><b>‚ÄúResearch and development‚Äù </b>‚Äì Learning programs foster innovation and teach the latest skills.</li><li><b>‚ÄúDesign, production and marketing‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Training ensures that workers get the knowledge they need to produce high-quality goods and high-quality services and to sell them effectively. </li><li><b>‚ÄúDistribution‚Äù </b>‚Äì WLP professionals understand that their company‚Äôs internal departments are their customers. </li><li><b>‚ÄúService‚Äù and ‚Äúsupport‚Äù </b>‚Äì Customer service and support employees need to participate in learning initiatives so they have the up-to-date information their customers want. </li></ul><h3>Proving How Learning Programs Meet ‚ÄúPerformance Objectives‚Äù</h3><p>Learning professionals must correlate their programs and demonstrate results according to the key performance indicators (KPIs) that matter most to their firm‚Äôs senior executives. The managers of learning programs must provide evidence that addresses questions about the value of corporate training and must communicate their successes in ways that are relevant to top executives.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúMost senior managers are unaware of how to actually incorporate learning into their strategic plans.‚Äù</blockquote><p>The balanced scorecard (BSC) provides an efficient and effective mechanism for compiling, evaluating and sharing this information. A balanced scorecard is both a ‚Äúmanagement system‚Äù and a ‚Äúmeasurement system,‚Äù and it begins with metrics. Organizations use the BSC to track ‚Äúfour perspectives: financial, learning and growth, customer and internal business processes.‚Äù Managers of learning programs can apply the BSC step by step to set goals that are supported with aligned measurement, track those metrics by collecting the right data and use the resulting information to prove the efficacy of learning in meeting corporate objectives.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe BSC is a strategic business tool helping management to effectively translate their mission into tactical and tangible performance measures and processes.‚Äù</blockquote><p>To prove that learning is a strategic contributor to organizational goals, set specific objectives and use quantifiable, scorecard metrics to track their outcome. You can use the balanced scorecard to prove the tangible, defined, mathematical results of workplace learning by showing its measurable impact on employee development and corporate outcomes. BSC provides the hard data you need to show top executives that workplace learning is an investment in better productivity and to prove that it supports four performance goals all organizations share:</p><ol><li value="1"><b>‚ÄúIncrease organizational value‚Äù </b>‚Äì Learning professionals must help senior managers understand that this value depends on both tangible assets, like cash and accounts receivables, and on intangible assets, such as intellectual capital. Learning initiatives are intangible investments with tangible benefits. </li><li value="2"><b>‚ÄúIncrease organizational profitability‚Äù </b>‚Äì To gain full appreciation from senior executives, learning professionals must show their program‚Äôs bottom-line impact.</li><li value="3"><b>‚ÄúIncrease organizational liquidity‚Äù </b>‚Äì Firms need cash to cover their short-term obligations. The way executives estimate future cash needs will determine how much they will allocate for specific budget items ‚Äì including learning based on prioritization. Use the scorecard to show how your work has earned a high priority for funding. </li><li value="4"><b>‚ÄúAligning investment with strategic objectives‚Äù </b>‚Äì The BSC helps learning leaders prove that they are accomplishing this goal by creating a statistical record of achievement. Only workers with the right ‚Äúskills, information, experience and knowledge‚Äù can achieve organizational goals, and those are the assets that learning programs deliver. With BSC, you can prove this concrete contribution.  </li></ol><blockquote>‚ÄúThe balanced scorecard environment is driven by strategic linkages and performance outcomes.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Learning program officers should regard their corporations‚Äô various departments as their principal customers. They must help these units achieve their goals by enhancing their workers‚Äô capabilities. Learning must be proactive, not reactive. Use the BSC to measure actual employee achievements. When staff members can see in measured terms exactly how far they‚Äôve come and how much they‚Äôve learned, they‚Äôll have a new attitude about who they are, why their work matters and where they fit within the organization.</p><h3>The Importance of Strategy</h3><p>In decades past, the prevailing notion was that a <em>Fortune </em>500 company could prosper by producing the same products and services that had proved popular over the years. Today, even the most successful companies cannot maintain their marketplace position unless they constantly reinvent their work. Modern companies must create strategies to meet ever-new innovation and expansion objectives. Corporate learning can help a company achieve its strategic goals only when WLP professionals understand those strategies and make sure that their learning initiatives directly support and advance them.</p><h3>Establishing a Strategic Framework</h3><p>Corporate planners often use a ‚Äústrategy map,‚Äù a graphic display of the ‚Äúlinkages and connections among primary business drivers.‚Äù This map translates strategy into specific organizational goals. The BSC extends the map by targeting the steps managers must take to attain these objectives. Envision a process depicted by a layered pyramid ‚Äì starting from the top ‚Äì with each of the following elements in its own layer:</p><ul><li><b>‚ÄúMission‚Äù</b> ‚Äì The reason the organization exists.</li><li><b>‚ÄúVision‚Äù</b> ‚Äì What the organization hopes to become.</li><li><b>‚ÄúStrategy‚Äù</b> ‚Äì The plan for the future.</li><li><b>‚ÄúStrategy map‚Äù</b> ‚Äì A depiction or visual presentation of the strategy.</li><li><b>‚ÄúBalanced scorecard‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Steps the organization will take to execute its strategy and measure its performance. </li><li><b>‚ÄúTargets and initiatives‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Specific corporate goals. </li><li><b>‚ÄúPersonal goals‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Individual employees‚Äô objectives. </li><li><b>‚ÄúStrategic results‚Äù</b> ‚Äì The organization‚Äôs goals form the base of the pyramid: ‚Äúsatisfied stakeholders, satisfied customers, efficient processes‚Äù and ‚Äúmotivated employees.‚Äù </li></ul><blockquote>‚ÄúPeople are essentially the primary resource of knowledge.‚Äù</blockquote><p>To carry out their strategies effectively, companies must track their progress. BSC functions as a performance measurement tool that enables managers to clarify strategy, communicate strategic goals, plan and create targets, and enhance learning. To this end, the balanced scorecard tracks performance in four areas ‚Äì objectives, measurements, results and programming ‚Äì to derive useful information about organizational achievement.</p><h3>‚ÄúFour Perspectives‚Äù</h3><p>The <em>Harvard Business Review</em> rates the BSC as ‚Äúone of the most influential management ideas of the past 75 years.‚Äù Many global corporations use the scorecard as a construct for setting goals and tracking accomplishments as they execute their strategy. It works differently from conventional management techniques, such as financial reporting, which tend to measure past performance. Such short-term approaches evaluate performance based only on the balance sheet. In contrast, the BSC looks ahead to defined performance and strategic milestones. With BSC, learning professionals can incorporates four crucial facets of a company‚Äôs operations:</p><ol><li value="1"><b>‚ÄúFinancial‚Äù</b> ‚Äì What do stakeholders think? </li><li value="2"><b>‚ÄúInternal process‚Äù</b> ‚Äì What must the organization do well?</li><li value="3"><b>‚ÄúCustomer‚Äù</b> ‚Äì What do consumers want?</li><li value="4"><b>‚ÄúLearning and growth‚Äù</b> ‚Äì How does the organization build more value? </li></ol><h3>Six Key Steps</h3><p>Learning professionals must establish balanced scorecard objectives that align their programs and metrics with each department‚Äôs specific goals. Interview senior executives and other stakeholders to develop BSCs based on those unit‚Äôs ‚Äústrategic learning requirements.‚Äù Setting learning goals that support each unit‚Äôs plans and that help the company requires WLP professionals to know all they can about how each unit‚Äôs work fulfills the company‚Äôs overall mission. Learning leaders must work hand in hand with these ‚Äúinternal clients‚Äù to tailor fully aligned educational options based on each audience‚Äôs important needs. Once they establish the right performance metrics for each learning activity, they can execute their firm‚Äôs particular learning strategies in six steps:</p><ol><li value="1"><b>‚ÄúAssess and analyze the strategy map‚Äù </b>‚Äì The strategy map depicts the organization‚Äôs prime strategic objective and the key linkages to attain it.</li><li value="2"><b>‚ÄúDetermine the objectives‚Äù </b>‚Äì Targeting objectives points to which learning activities are most useful to attaining them. </li><li value="3"><b>‚ÄúDetermine the performance measurement tools utilized‚Äù</b> ‚Äì These metrics demonstrate performance; for example, monthly customer satisfaction reports.</li><li value="4"><b>‚ÄúDetermine the performance targets‚Äù </b>‚Äì A performance target could be ‚Äúa 50% increase in prospective sales leads.‚Äù </li><li value="5"><b>‚ÄúDetermine the initiatives affecting learning‚Äù </b>‚Äì For example, such an initiative could be to ‚Äúincrease resources to R&amp;D.‚Äù </li><li value="6"><b>‚ÄúDetermine the learning initiatives‚Äù </b>‚Äì Now, determine exactly what type of learning programming fulfills the established targets.</li></ol><blockquote>‚ÄúManagers will never give learning professionals full credit for resolving a business concern, so stop trying to convince them.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Learning initiatives matter to senior executives who are trying to align their units with organizational strategic objectives. Learning professionals who can help employees meet corporate performance goals gain credibility and provide senior management with the evidence to view their departments as valuable long-term investments.</p>
