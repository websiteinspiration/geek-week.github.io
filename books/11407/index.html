						<h2 class="first">Recommendation</h2>
					
				<div class="recommendation" itemprop="reviewBody">
					<p>Vast numbers of books discuss Toyota, but this one is more than just another paean to how well the firm uses its production system. Emi Osono, Norihiko Shimizu and Hirotaka Takeuchi, working with translator John Kyle Dorton, focus on several different elements of Toyota‚Äôs culture. They explain how the company‚Äôs leaders diagnose its internal contradictions and use them as a source of energy and a springboard for creativity. Where most corporate leaders see waste and a sad absence of harmonization, Toyota‚Äôs executives forge a fresh road through experimentation and continuous improvement. The book offers new ideas to help you assess your organization‚Äôs internal contradictions and turn them to your advantage. Despite being originally written in Japanese, and despite the firm‚Äôs recalls and woes, this volume reads well and features illustrations that help you understand the concepts behind the words. <em>BooksInShort</em> recommends it to businesspeople who are curious about Toyota, its culture and the culture of their own organizations.</p>

		<h2>Take-Aways</h2>
		<ul class="takeaways">
			
				<li>
					Use your company‚Äôs internal contradictions productively as a force for change instead of trying to eliminate them.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					For example, Toyota‚Äôs employees revere the corporation‚Äôs heritage and values, but they adapt to current conditions.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					Its leaders manage ‚Äúexpansive‚Äù and ‚Äúintegrative‚Äù forces to fuel improvement.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					They set impossible goals and make Toyota better by trying to fulfill them.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					Toyota‚Äôs programs emphasize action and experimentation and tolerate errors.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					Listen to and learn from your customers; benefit from your knowledge of local needs.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					Communication happens because people connect with one another, not because they have modern systems.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					Rather than cutting underperforming employees, give them new training and prepare them to make real contributions.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					Corporate efficiency is important, but reducing institutional knowledge by firing people who know their jobs and their customers is not the road to improvement.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					The moment you feel you have arrived is the moment your company begins to decline.

					Summary
				</h2>
			
			<div class="abstractText ">
				<h3>Toyota: Pushing Beyond the Boundaries </h3><p>Almost all companies, especially large ones, wrestle with internal contradictions, opposing objectives, and paradoxes in operations and culture. The difference between Toyota and nearly all other firms is that its leaders embrace these complexities and consciously exploit their energy to drive improvement. Most companies try to decide which opposite force is better and then push to eliminate the lesser force. For example, traditionally, the design of luxury cars focused on either power or fuel efficiency. Toyota‚Äôs management challenged its Lexus design team to incorporate both. Rather than rejecting these manifestly opposing goals, the team used them to achieve something beyond any other luxury car. As a result, they created a powerful brand. Toyota‚Äôs executives consciously use contradictions to create challenges that employees must overcome to attain higher goals, surpass conventional expectations and reach for performance levels previously considered impossible.</p><blockquote>‚Äú[Toyota‚Äôs] success contradicts established, successful practice, but in fact, this seeming paradox is key to its success.‚Äù</blockquote><p>If you dig into Toyota layer by layer in search of the core of its success, you will learn that Toyota‚Äôs leaders call upon a mix of ‚Äúexpansive forces‚Äù to foster its need to grow, as well as a second set of ‚Äúintegrative forces‚Äù to hold the company together and allow its components to communicate and function. These forces are:</p><h3>Expansive Force One: ‚ÄúImpossible Goals‚Äù</h3><p>Toyota‚Äôs managers set goals that seem unattainable because trying to achieve hard objectives can move people to new levels of accomplishment. Impossible goals aren‚Äôt just window dressing at Toyota. They are ‚Äúframe-breakers,‚Äù the fuel that leaders use to penetrate complacency and conventional thinking. Extreme goals receive high-level management support even though they may not be feasible. However, surprisingly often, people achieve amazing results pursuing supposedly impossible objectives. Toyota‚Äôs managers first put its cars on sale in the U.S. in 1957 even though they understood that their vehicles didn‚Äôt ‚Äúquite measure up.‚Äù Shotaro Kamiya, then head of sales in Japan, knew that the effort would suffer ‚Äúsome setbacks,‚Äù but that the company‚Äôs carmakers would learn, improve and eventually succeed. And that is what happened as Toyota‚Äôs people steadily followed its ‚ÄúPDCA‚Äù model: ‚ÄúPlan, Do, Check, Act.‚Äù</p><h3>Expansive Force Two: ‚ÄúExperimentation‚Äù</h3><p>Toyota‚Äôs managers encourage employees to act on what they know to try to make the company better, even if their knowledge is imperfect or incomplete. Making mistakes and encountering obstacles are accepted factors in Toyota‚Äôs culture. For example, starting in 2002, Toyota‚Äôs operation in Thailand produced the International Multipurpose Vehicle (IMV), which used a single platform for a sports utility vehicle, minivan or truck. The plan to sell the IMV in 140 markets hit a snag: Meeting each nation‚Äôs governmental regulations and driving challenges (from sandstorms to floods) bogged down the IMV team and made delay seem inevitable. Rather than avoiding accountability or blaming someone else, Toyota‚Äôs executive vice president, Akio Toyoda, took responsibility. He allowed the IMV team to continue working without pressure. Toyoda said that even if the effort failed, it offered an opportunity for a great deal of learning. Toyota‚Äôs management allows failure because it wants people to experiment boldly. If leaders punish failure, people won‚Äôt take the risks that could move them to new levels of performance.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúAt the very instant that we become satisfied, at the very moment we think that the status quo is good enough, that‚Äôs when we start to decline.‚Äù [ ‚Äì Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe]</blockquote><p>Toyota employees use an eight-step problem-solving process. They learn to 1) define an issue; 2) divide it into its components; 3) identify goals; 4) determine the reason for the problem; 5) create a ‚Äúcountermeasure‚Äù; 6) use it; 7) assess the steps they‚Äôve used and their outcome; and 8) institutionalize the solution that works. Toyota‚Äôs leaders encourage employees to experiment and to learn from their mistakes. When staff members want to communicate ‚Äúthe essential information needed to solve a problem,‚Äù they use the ‚ÄúA3 reporting process,‚Äù named after the 11-by-17-inch sheet of paper on which they must clearly condense their information. Managers picked the A3 size because it was the biggest sheet that fit the fax machines available at the time.</p><h3>Expansive Force Three: ‚ÄúLocal Customization‚Äù</h3><p>One of Toyota‚Äôs most profound contradictions is balancing its leaders‚Äô goal of making the company efficient globally while simultaneously being alert to local issues in its plants and markets. Because its managers listen to their employees and encourage them to experiment, the workforce is highly motivated to seek solutions to local matters and to pass along what they learn to the whole company. For instance, Toyota‚Äôs team designed the Scion for young Japanese drivers who liked ‚Äútuning‚Äù their vehicle, that is, customizing both the look of the car and the way it runs. Although sales managers calculated that this flexibility also would be popular in Germany, the customization market in the U.S. was relatively small. This meant that Toyota‚Äôs engineers had to come up with more options for the Scion than most of its vehicles provide, in order to offer customization in Japan and Europe, and a complete package in the United States. The company‚Äôs experts study the local environments where Toyota operates. Then they create products for those markets and use what they‚Äôve learned around the world.</p><h3>Integrative Force One: the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Philosophies‚Äù</h3><p>The core values in Toyota‚Äôs culture are based on bedrock principles that its founders began teaching at the company‚Äôs inception and developed over decades. Toyota‚Äôs people use these ideas each day to clarify their decisions and actions. The corporate culture rests on four axioms published in its <em>Green Book,</em> also called <em>The Toyota Way 2001</em>:</p><ol><li value="1">‚ÄúTomorrow will be better than today.‚Äù</li><li value="2">‚ÄúEverybody should win.‚Äù</li><li value="3">‚ÄúCustomer first, dealers second and manufacturer last.‚Äù</li><li value="4">‚Äú<em>Genchi genbutsu</em>,‚Äù which means ‚Äúgo and see things for yourself, firsthand.‚Äù</li></ol><h3>Integrative Force Two: The ‚ÄúNerve System‚Äù Shares Knowledge via People</h3><p>How can a company that employs hundreds of thousands of people around the globe and that produces more than nine million cars a year maintain learning as such a vibrant part of its culture? How does that culture foster such quick, pervasive communication? The first skill that the firm‚Äôs leaders nurture is intense listening. They emphasize face-to-face meetings. They encourage staffers to act as the company‚Äôs nervous system, and to receive and transmit information with lightning rapidity. Although Toyota‚Äôs people have modern information systems and communication tools, its leaders know that good machinery cannot replace the person-to-person contact that underlies their communicative culture, which has five main features:</p><ol><li value="1">‚ÄúOpen and lateral dissemination of know-how.‚Äù</li><li value="2">‚ÄúFreedom to voice contrary opinions.‚Äù</li><li value="3">‚ÄúFrequent face-to-face interaction.‚Äù</li><li value="4">‚ÄúMaking tacit knowledge explicit in the Toyota Way.‚Äù</li><li value="5">‚ÄúFormal and informal organizational support mechanisms.‚Äù</li></ol><h3>Integrative Force Three: ‚ÄúUp and In‚Äù in Human Resources</h3><p>Most companies have an ‚Äúup or out‚Äù attitude about advancement. You move up or you leave. Toyota‚Äôs human resources (HR) policies emphasize job security and the ongoing improvement and development of each person‚Äôs skills and value. Managers rarely push underperformers out the door. Instead, these employees receive new training, varied assignments and opportunities to make real contributions. Toyota‚Äôs HR managers focus on hiring the right people and keeping them. This up-and-in policy has five traits:</p><ol><li value="1">An emphasis on permanent employment for all.</li><li value="2">A focus on continual training and development for every employee.</li><li value="3">The belief that great teamwork produces real power for the company.</li><li value="4">A directive that employees should act rather than talk and debate.</li><li value="5">A decision to use worker evaluations to help people learn rather than to reward or punish them. </li></ol><h3>Balancing Efficiency and Investment</h3><p>Toyota‚Äôs executives prioritize accumulating resources for long-term success. Most of its competitors focus on returns to shareholders, even if that requires producing income by shedding underperforming businesses and firing people. Whereas shareholder-driven companies dismiss executives who make mistakes, Toyota‚Äôs leaders admit their mistakes and encourage employees to take chances and to use errors as opportunities. Toyota‚Äôs leaders work to build a culture based on their employees‚Äô knowledge. They emphasize communicating information about the company on many different levels, such as performance, technology, policy development and job improvement. Rather than looking for people to fire to improve financial performance, managers seek staff members who might benefit the company more in new assignments. They consider how the company can adapt to enhance employees‚Äô performance, rather than trying to cram everyone into the same work model. People need time to develop; at Toyota, leaders are willing to give them that time.</p><h3>Feeling Content Should Make You Nervous</h3><p>Toyota‚Äôs culture has no comfort zone. It emphasizes that the firm must never plateau or rest. In the view of Toyota‚Äôs leadership, complacency equals decline. Management wages an unceasing struggle against corporate decline by taking six forceful actions:</p><ol><li value="1"><strong>Striving to maintain its core culture</strong> ‚Äì This is not easy in the face of rapid growth.</li><li value="2"><strong>Keeping employees learning and trying to improve</strong> ‚Äì This requires resisting the complacency that could naturally follow the company‚Äôs long-term success.</li><li value="3"><strong>Preventing its principles from becoming restrictive</strong> ‚Äì The firm‚Äôs core axioms should not become straitjackets.</li><li value="4"><strong>Adapting its principles to include insights from around the world </strong>‚Äì Toyota is a Japanese company, but its workforce is global, so it needs a broad perspective.</li><li value="5"><strong>Prioritizing long-term progress over short-term financial gain</strong> ‚Äì Toyota‚Äôs leaders spent little time courting the financial markets as they focused on long-range goals, but global competition now demands that they be more aware of market needs.</li><li value="6"><strong>Becoming more nimble globally</strong> ‚Äì Toyota traditionally competed against Japanese, American and European automakers. The rise of Korean and Chinese car companies requires its strategists to be more flexible worldwide.</li></ol><h3>Toyota‚Äôs 10 Contradictions</h3><p>You can learn from Toyota‚Äôs internal contradictions if you harness them as Toyota‚Äôs leaders do. They perceive their culture‚Äôs contradictions as the source of their ability to move forward innovatively. Managers use these internal contradictions rather than resolving them. Insiders try to stay open to learning from every employee and stakeholder. Toyota‚Äôs 10 contradictions (some of which are grouped in pairs) are:</p><ol><li value="1"><strong>‚ÄúImpossible goals‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì ‚ÄúKnow where reality stands to take on impossibly high goals.‚Äù</li><li value="2"><strong>‚ÄúExperimentation‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì<strong> </strong>‚ÄúConduct small, interim experiments to realize the occasional big jump.‚Äù </li><li value="3"><strong>‚ÄúLocal customization‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì ‚ÄúLocalize to become global.‚Äù<strong> </strong></li><li value="4"><strong>‚ÄúFounders‚Äô philosophies‚Äù </strong>‚Äì ‚ÄúCherish the founders‚Äô philosophies to nurture leaders.‚Äù </li><li value="5"><strong>‚ÄúFounders‚Äô philosophies‚Äù </strong>‚Äì ‚ÄúRemain incomplete in order to grow.‚Äù </li><li value="6"><strong>‚ÄúNerve system‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì Create ‚Äúan interconnected world through an analog Web in the digital age.‚Äù </li><li value="7">‚Äú<strong>Nerve system‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì Give ‚Äúbad news first to become a good corporate citizen.‚Äù </li><li value="8"><strong>‚ÄúUp-and-in human resource management‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì ‚ÄúTo maximize productivity, don‚Äôt let go of people.‚Äù</li><li value="9"><strong>‚ÄúUp-and-in human resource management‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì ‚ÄúAppeal<strong> </strong>to human<strong> </strong>compassion to increase industrial production.‚Äù</li><li value="10"><strong>‚ÄúResource base‚Äù </strong>‚Äì ‚ÄúSay no to shortcuts for long-term gains.‚Äù</li></ol>
