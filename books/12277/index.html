					<p>Many new hires do not last longer than six months. One out of two new employees fails to meet the organization‚Äôs expectations. Why? Often, employers make little or no effort to acclimate these staffers to the job. Thus, their employees start off on the wrong foot, and many find it hard to ‚Äúchange course.‚Äù However, George Bradt and Mary Vonnegut deliver a proven program you can use to help new workers become immediately productive. Bradt, founder and director of the executive-transition consultancy PrimeGenesis, and Vonnegut, a partner at the firm, bring considerable experience to the topic.<em> BooksInShort</em> recommends their book‚Äôs thoughtful approach to onboarding. Though the guide is poorly structured in parts, it provides easy-to-follow, practical advice for bringing people on board and keeping them there.</p>

					Summary
				</h2>
			
			<div class="abstractText ">
				<h3>Why Effective Onboarding Matters</h3><p>Does your organization have a cohesive, strategic onboarding program? Many companies do not. For example, one firm annually hired seven or eight salespeople who all showed the potential and desire to become managers. However, the company had room to promote only one or two of them each year, so those who weren‚Äôt promoted often left the firm. This inefficient hiring approach meant that the majority of sales recruits the company employed would eventually be disappointed.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúMost people understand or can quickly figure out the basics of acquiring, accommodating, assimilating and accelerating new employees. Our core premise is that things work better when all efforts point in the same direction, integrated into one Total Onboarding Program (TOP).‚Äù</blockquote><p>Fortunately for this firm, the recruiter recognized the problem and implemented a fresh strategy. She divided the positions equally into managerial and sales functions. Each year, the company employed three or four people who competed for the sales manager slots, but it also hired three or four staffers who were career salespeople. Following this approach enabled the firm to reduce turnover and decrease the number of hires. It also boosted employee satisfaction: Staffers who pursued the management track had a better chance of succeeding, and professional salespeople could focus on their true passion ‚Äì selling.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúGetting new employees up to speed is one of the toughest jobs hiring managers face.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Always examine why you are employing someone, and consider how a new hire may affect other staffers in your company. To help ensure the success of your new hires and internal recruits, implement an onboarding program that includes five main steps. The first, ‚Äúaligning,‚Äù involves achieving companywide consensus about the need for a new employee, as well as his or her purpose in the organization. The second is ‚Äúacquiring,‚Äù or finding and hiring the best candidate. The third is ‚Äúaccommodating,‚Äù providing the new hire with the necessary resources for the job. The fourth is ‚Äúassimilating,‚Äù or integrating the individual into the team, and the fifth is ‚Äúaccelerating,‚Äù or helping the staffer and the team raise productivity.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúA total onboarding program can dramatically improve the performance, fit and readiness for the job of every person who takes on a new role.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Many companies find that their hiring systems flounder because the various departments and individuals involved don‚Äôt coordinate effectively. For successful onboarding, hiring personnel, managers and human resources staff must view the five steps as unified components of the onboarding process, not as separate, distinct tasks and responsibilities. These people must work together to ensure the employee‚Äôs smooth, continuous progress throughout the program. This is the basis for the ‚ÄúTotal Onboarding Program‚Äù (TOP).</p><blockquote>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt begin to recruit anyone until you understand how their role is going to help deliver results that move the organization forward in line with its purposes and priorities.‚Äù</blockquote><p>For the TOP to work, hiring managers must guide employees through the ‚Äúonboarding experience‚Äù from start to finish. These managers are responsible for developing an initial onboarding plan for each individual, and for ensuring the support of important stakeholders ‚Äì that is, the people who can most influence the employee‚Äôs success. The TOP has four main stages:</p><h3>1. ‚ÄúPrepare for Your New Employee‚Äôs Success Before You Start Recruiting‚Äù (Align)</h3><p>Approach hiring as a ‚Äústrategic opportunity,‚Äù not a ‚Äútransactional event.‚Äù<b> </b>Don‚Äôt rush to fill open jobs. First, look hard at each available position, and confirm that filling it makes sense for your firm. If it doesn‚Äôt, redefine the role so it better supports your business goals. Clarify the skills or aptitudes that describe your ideal candidate. Be specific. Find out what other stakeholders expect from the role. Identify your firm‚Äôs ‚Äúpurpose and priorities,‚Äù and then focus on the specific job and how it fits into the broader organizational context. Determine your business objective for hiring, and decide how you will quantify your return on investment (ROI).</p><blockquote>‚ÄúHaving a powerful slate of potential candidates relieves you from feeling you have to close the sale with your lead candidate when a nagging voice is telling you something is not 100% right.‚Äù</blockquote><p>During recruiting and onboarding, you and your organization will convey messages about the company. Make sure the messages you send are clear, deliberate and consistent by planning ahead. Develop a ‚Äúset of messages and communication points‚Äù that your stakeholders approve and support, and use them as the basis for all your interactions, including the job announcement. To begin framing your Total Onboarding Program, construct a time line for the process and distribute it among the stakeholders. Include these important mileposts:</p><ul><li><b>‚ÄúPlan ready‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Create a plan, incorporating your completed time line and a ‚Äúrecruiting brief,‚Äù which identifies the ‚Äújob title, department, compensation grade and target start date.‚Äù This document also clarifies the purpose and duties of the new job, defines what success looks like, and specifies the ideal candidate‚Äôs ‚Äústrengths, motivation and fit.‚Äù </li><li><b>‚ÄúStakeholders aligned‚Äù </b>‚Äì Contact all your stakeholders directly to secure their support of your plan, the time line and the recruiting brief.</li><li><b>‚ÄúRecruiter selected‚Äù </b>‚Äì Find a consultant or appoint an in-house recruiter, or do the recruiting yourself. </li><li><b>‚ÄúRecruiter briefed [and] job posted‚Äù</b> ‚Äì If you appoint a recruiter, help him or her grasp the brief‚Äôs ‚Äúnuances.‚Äù</li><li><b>‚ÄúCandidates sourced‚Äù </b>‚Äì Avoid ‚Äúsequential job searches,‚Äù which tend to be inefficient. Instead, do one search, inside and outside the company, to find all your candidates. Then winnow them down to a select few for the first interviews.</li><li><b>‚ÄúCandidates presented‚Äù </b>‚Äì Similarly, ask the recruiter to present all your candidates at once. That way, you can compare them easily and choose the ones to interview.</li><li><b>‚ÄúInitial interviews complete‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Use open-ended questions to screen candidates and uncover their strengths, motivation and fit.<b> </b>But don‚Äôt spend too much time on the first interviews. Conduct them in a single day, or spread them over a few days.</li><li><b>‚ÄúFinal interviews complete‚Äù </b>‚Äì Move quickly so you don‚Äôt lose the opportunity to hire a candidate because someone else steals that person away. </li><li><b>‚ÄúPost-interview follow-ups‚Äù </b>‚Äì Confirm all the lead candidates‚Äô references and background details, and pose any additional questions you may have.</li><li><b>‚ÄúSelection made and offer extended‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Personalize your offer. First deliver it face-to-face or, if that‚Äôs not possible, by phone. Then send a detailed written offer.</li><li><b>‚ÄúFollow-up campaign‚Äù </b>‚Äì Give the candidate a week to consider. Call after a few days to emphasize your interest, but don‚Äôt hound him or her.</li><li><b>‚ÄúOffer accepted‚Äù </b>‚Äì Now your job is to ensure that ‚Äúthe sale stays closed.‚Äù</li><li><b>‚ÄúPersonal onboarding plan prework‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Give the new employee his or her tailored onboarding guidelines, the job description and other relevant information.</li><li><b>‚ÄúPersonal onboarding plan meeting‚Äù </b>‚Äì Schedule a one-on-one meeting, possibly off-site, to create the staffer‚Äôs individual onboarding plan.</li><li><b>‚ÄúPersonal onboarding plan handoff‚Äù </b>‚Äì Encourage the employee to take charge of his or her onboarding, but continue to play a supporting role.</li><li><b>‚ÄúNew employee announced‚Äù </b>‚Äì Share news of the hire companywide.</li><li><b>‚ÄúNew employee accommodations‚Äù </b>‚Äì Set up the new person to succeed.</li><li><b>‚ÄúNew employee welcomed‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Carefully plan the staffer‚Äôs first day on the job.</li><li><b>‚ÄúAssimilation efforts‚Äù </b>‚Äì Begin integrating the employee into the firm immediately.</li><li><b>‚ÄúPersonal onboarding</b> <b>plan</b>: <b>key events‚Äù</b> ‚Äì Be prepared to provide additional assistance for at least the ‚Äúfirst 100 days.‚Äù</li><li><b>‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù </b>‚Äì Ask for the employee‚Äôs feedback often, so you can address any issues.</li></ul><h3>2. ‚ÄúRecruit in a Way That Reinforces Your Messages‚Äù (Acquire)</h3><p>Recruiting quality employees requires salesmanship. To attract the best staffers, market your organization to them. Make your company‚Äôs ‚Äúemployment brand‚Äù more compelling by showing that your firm is ‚Äúa great place to work.‚Äù Search broadly for candidates, including ‚Äúdifferent industries, generations, nationalities and cultures.‚Äù Pitch your organization directly to top employees who work for other firms. Engage a large ‚Äúslate‚Äù of strong candidates who are highly qualified and who fit comfortably within your organization‚Äôs culture.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúRoles reverse at the moment of a job offer. The candidate moves from selling to buying. You move from buying to selling.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Think and act strategically to sell your firm to a potential new hire. Plan and implement a formal ‚Äúselling campaign‚Äù that culminates in an offer. Identify the people who can influence the candidate, including family members, mentors, and so on. Understand what motivates the candidate and uncover any concerns he or she may have. Hire the candidate for a good reason: He or she may ask you why you‚Äôre interested. Most important, ‚Äúclose the sale,‚Äù and then ensure that counteroffers don‚Äôt derail it.</p><h3>3. ‚ÄúGive Your New Employee a Big Head Start Before Day One‚Äù (Accommodate)</h3><p>Helping your new hire create an individual onboarding plan is a great way to build your relationship. First, complete the prework. The new hire‚Äôs prework is developing a draft of the onboarding plan; your prework is naming the stakeholders. Second, get the new staffer to verbalize his or her ideas for the onboarding process. Third, collaborate to develop a superior onboarding plan. Fourth, enable the employee to begin directing his or her onboarding program, but continue to offer support using the ‚ÄúEASE‚Äù method of ‚ÄúEncouraging, Aligning, Solving and Ending distractions.‚Äù</p><blockquote>‚ÄúCo-creating the personal onboarding plan is a powerful demonstration of your interest in your new employee‚Äôs success.‚Äù</blockquote><p>The way you communicate a new hire‚Äôs arrival matters. As you plan the announcement, confirm that pivotal colleagues and managers will help you welcome the staffer. Determine how you will convey the message to various audiences, including the new hire and his or her stakeholders. Decide how and when you will broadcast the news companywide. Then identify whom you should speak to before and after the formal announcement to get your employee off to a good start. As the news spreads throughout your firm, monitor the ‚Äúcascade‚Äù to adapt your announcement strategy and timing.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúDesign your new employee‚Äôs experience as you would a customer experience.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Arrange the new employee‚Äôs workspace in advance, so it‚Äôs fully operational from day one. Supply the staffer with organizational charts and directories, appropriate business plans, and so on, and make sure he or she has access to the company intranet. Consider assigning a coach or mentor to help the employee get over any initial rough spots.</p><h3>4. ‚ÄúInspire Your New Employee to Deliver Better Results‚Äù <b>(Assimilate and Accelerate)</b></h3><p><b>Think of your employee‚Äôs first day as ‚Äúshowtime.‚Äù As you plan for this day, consider two ‚Äúconstituencies‚Äù:</b></p><ol><li value="1"><b><b>Your organization</b> ‚Äì Ideally, the employee will make a positive impression on the firm. At the day‚Äôs end, you want people saying, ‚ÄúYou made absolutely the right hire.‚Äù Help the new employee succeed by explaining such basic matters as working hours, parking regulations, dress codes, and so on. Encourage the staffer to host a ‚Äúmeet and greet.‚Äù</b></li><li value="2"><b><b>Your new employee </b>‚Äì Conversely, you want your company to make a great impression on the newcomer. The first day exposes this person to ‚Äúbroad, unmanaged contact‚Äù with the firm. To make it a ‚Äúperfect validation‚Äù of the messages you communicated during recruitment, plan and prepare for the employee‚Äôs arrival. For instance, to gain insights about how a new employee might see your firm, have an outside observer, such as a colleague from a different department, walk through your workspace and report to you what he or she observes. Clean up any problems that surface.</b></li></ol><blockquote>‚ÄúYour new employee is the lead player on day one, but you are the director.‚Äù</blockquote><p><b>Help foster strong work relationships for the new employee. Introduce the staffer to important colleagues and to any special ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes networks.‚Äù Be sensitive to generational, socioeconomic and cultural differences that may affect how the employee responds to the onboarding experience. Tailor your approach accordingly. Most important, make sure that all new employees get the ‚Äúresources, support and follow-through‚Äù they need. Remember that ‚Äúenabling and inspiring is an ongoing effort.‚Äù</b></p><h3><b>It‚Äôs Time to Get On Board with Onboarding</b></h3><p><b>With existing employees routinely advancing or leaving, and new employees moving in to replace them, intelligent onboarding always matters. Embed the Total Onboarding Program in all your talent management and succession planning activities. The benefits of this program are manifold: Your firm will save time on recruiting, hiring and acclimating new employees. It will minimize hiring mistakes resulting from poorly communicated job requirements. And your new hires will be less likely to feel ‚Äúbuyer‚Äôs remorse‚Äù and more likely to align with the organization‚Äôs primary strategies.‚ÄúMost people understand or can quickly figure out the basics of acquiring, accommodating, assimilating and accelerating new employees. Our core premise is that things work better when all efforts point in the same direction, integrated into one Total Onboarding Program (TOP).‚Äù</b></p>
