				<div class="recommendation" itemprop="reviewBody">
					<p>The baby boomers‚Äô children have grown up to be master multitaskers, able to send text messages, download music, watch TV and study at the same time. They‚Äôre entering the labor pool in droves, and they expect their jobs to be not only stimulating and well-paying but also (if you can imagine it) fun. Who are these extraordinary people with their radical work ethic? They are the ‚ÄúMillennials,‚Äù the second wave of baby boomer children who are questioning the way their parents do business. Dr. Joanne G. Sujansky and Dr. Jan Ferri-Reed caution managers that they must cater to millennials or risk losing billions in employee turnover and unachieved productivity. The authors explain how the members of this over-nurtured, well-educated, technology-savvy generation differ from their parents and grandparents. They also explain how to make workplaces hip enough to attract and retain this new talent. <em>BooksInShort</em> suggests this insightful read to baby boomers who are struggling to manage these bright, energetic, puzzling and sometimes exasperating employees.</p>

					Summary
				</h2>
			
			<div class="abstractText ">
				<h3>The ‚ÄúMillennials‚Äù</h3><p>Are the following employees exceptions to the normal rules or precursors of things to come?</p><ul><li>The newest member of the department tells his boss that he can‚Äôt work over the weekend because he has tickets to a sporting event.</li><li>A recent college graduate attends a job fair with her father and lets him do the talking.</li><li>A rising star steps off the fast track at her company to start her own business.</li><li>A prospective employee sends a human resources director a text message saying thanks for the interview.</li><li>A young man asks his boss to consider him for a promotion years ahead of the company‚Äôs traditional advancement time line.</li></ul><blockquote>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a generational tidal wave coming that‚Äôs threatening to shake up workplaces throughout the world.‚Äù</blockquote><p>This is how millennials act. These children of the baby boom are continuing to enter the  labor force, and they‚Äôre bringing a new work style and point of view with them. It remains to be seen whether their attitude is problematic or merely different, but companies that don‚Äôt alter the way they operate to accommodate these new workers are jeopardizing their future.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe Millennials are bringing to the workplace a new type of work ethic and a very different perspective than that of their Baby Boomer parents.‚Äù</blockquote><p>For the first time, four generations are sharing the workplace:</p><ol><li value="1"><strong>‚ÄúMatures‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì Senior workers born between 1909 and 1945.</li><li value="2"><strong>‚ÄúBaby Boomers‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì Employees born after World War II, from 1946 to 1964.</li><li value="3"><strong>‚ÄúGen Xers‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì The first wave of boomer children, born between 1965 and 1979. </li><li value="4"><strong>‚ÄúMillennials‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì The second wave of boomer offspring, born from 1980 to 1999. </li></ol><blockquote>‚ÄúAs well educated and technologically savvy as they are, Millennials simply don‚Äôt look at the requirements of getting a job done in the same way.‚Äù</blockquote><p>How is this newest generation of workers different from its boomer parents? One major shift is that millennials don‚Äôt expect to work at one company throughout their careers. They‚Äôve watched their parents put in 50 to 60 hours of work a week only to be fired when their employers needed to downsize. That may be why millennials value work-life balance more than salary and benefits, and are not willing to sacrifice everything in their lives on the career bonfire.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúLike no generation before them, they grew up with sophisticated technology, and it has come to define their lives.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Millennials seek constant stimulation and have no patience with a job‚Äôs boring aspects. They‚Äôre geared to master the latest challenge and move on down the road. The latest technology has always had an impact on every facet of their lives. They grew up with personal computers, the Internet, MP3s, cellphones, texting, instant messaging and social networking. They simply do not send or receive messages the same way that other generations do.</p><h3>Better or Different?</h3><p>The millennials‚Äô work ethic is different from their parents‚Äô approach, but they are as talented and productive. In fact, they make up history‚Äôs best-educated, most technologically adept generation. They just aren‚Äôt going to do their jobs the same way their parents do. For example, millennials expect to have fun at work, a concept that is foreign to the mature worker. Although boomers demanded and received some concessions from their employers, including flextime, casual Fridays and maternity leave, they usually don‚Äôt expect work to be entertaining. Millennials, however, want a stimulating, engaging and pleasurable work environment. Companies that provide such an environment report increased employee productivity and decreased job-related stress.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúTechnology is at the heart of the Millennial generation‚Äôs work ethic.‚Äù</blockquote><p>The millennials are, first and foremost, multitaskers. They are comfortable watching television while working on their laptops, sending text messages and listening to their iPods. To them, even e-mail is too slow; they prefer immediate communication, like instant messages. They don‚Äôt have the patience for endless meetings, and prefer videoconferencing and using related technology, like Skype and NetMeeting. They tend to be more results-focused. Millennials believe that it doesn‚Äôt matter where or when they do a job, as long as they do it well.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòFacebook generation‚Äô could well come to redefine the nature of work in both space and time.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Baby boomers define ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù as checking in with everyone in the room at a business function. Not millennials. To them, networking refers to communicating socially online through Facebook, MySpace and similar Web sites. They use the Internet to express their opinions and track down evaluations of everything that affects them. Blogs and networking sites abound with advice and recommendations. Millennials trust this newest kind of word-of-mouth information more than traditional advertising. Marketers are responding to this change successfully with new communication vehicles, such as viral videos.</p><h3>Bred by Boomers</h3><p>The millennials do share many of their parents‚Äô values, such as working hard to achieve goals, honoring and respecting diversity, and upholding many different facets of personal freedom. Baby boomers went through the first technological revolution as television became a permanent feature in every home. Boomers and millennials share a love of music. In fact, millennials might be the first generation to embrace their parents‚Äô music. Although they may be listening on iPods, not on CD players, millennials are still rocking out to Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix. Furthermore, the music has a familiar message. Nirvana‚Äôs ‚ÄúSmells Like Teen Spirit‚Äù expresses the same adolescent angst as Mick Jagger‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Get No Satisfaction.‚ÄùBoth generations survived defining events that shaped their personal and collective experience. Whereas boomers lived through the war in Vietnam, and millennials were stunned by the space shuttle <em>Challenger</em> explosion, both generations vividly recall the U.S.‚Äôs first massive terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúMillennials learned an important lesson that their parents eventually came to understand: There is no reward for loyalty to a corporation.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Baby boomer parents were deeply involved in every aspect of millennials‚Äô upbringing and development, more so than any previous generations. Boomers chauffeured their kids from one after-school activity to the next, provided tutors when they needed extra help and signed them up for specialized summer camps if they showed a whiff of propensity, talent or interest in a pursuit. As a result, members of this generation rely heavily on their parents and require much more personal responsiveness from their managers.</p><h3>Feedback with Feelings</h3><p>Millennials need constant feedback, praise and encouragement to feel that they are doing well at work and that their bosses appreciate their efforts. Millennials reward companies that provide this type of recognition with a high level of effort and commitment. They respond to timely, specific feedback that relates to their performance, particularly performance they individually control. When you offer comments, think about the employee‚Äôs needs, keep a record of the conversation and avoid ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù words, such as ‚Äúnever‚Äù and ‚Äúalways.‚Äù</p><blockquote>‚ÄúTo simply plop Millennials into cubicles in front of obsolete computers and expect them to grind out an eight-hour day is an exercise in foolishness.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Managing millennials is a bit different. For instance, although they want feedback, they‚Äôre particularly sensitive to criticism. Always include a positive statement when you give corrective counsel. For example, instead of saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk about this issue again in a few weeks,‚Äù try saying, ‚ÄúI trust you to do the right thing and make the changes we discussed.‚Äù Positive feedback goes a long way in motivating millennials. Celebrate and acknowledge successes big and small.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúIf companies don‚Äôt make an effort to create the type of work climate that appeals to [Millenials], these organizations could find themselves in the shallow end of the talent pool in coming years!‚Äù</blockquote><p>Keep your fingers on the pulse of your youngest employees. Don‚Äôt wait for their exit interviews to uncover problems. Solicit their input by scheduling regular meetings. Ask such questions as ‚ÄúWhat do you like about the work you are doing?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat would you like to learn or do next?‚Äù Listen carefully to the answers without explaining or rationalizing.</p><h3>The Cool Factor</h3><p>Millennials want more from their jobs than salaries and benefits. They can‚Äôt produce their best work from the confines of a cube. They constitute a counter-cubicle culture and prefer open offices that facilitate collaboration.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe future success of the Millennials will be dependent upon how they are groomed for future leadership today.‚Äù</blockquote><p>In fact, millennials desire, need and demand hip places to work. But, what do they consider cool? In many ways, they want to do the same things at work that they do everywhere else: social networking, instant messaging and surfing the Internet. They want to use all the latest technology without prohibitions, boundaries or limits. They will be uncomfortable at companies that try to curtail the use of personal e-mail or that ban playing computer games at work. Aside from the fun factor, millennials seek other perquisites. Extras that make them feel welcome and energized include health club facilities, espresso bars, dry-cleaning services, aerobics classes and volunteer projects. Millennials want to feel good about their companies and to be proud of the work they do. Their parents raised them to take social responsibility seriously. Their educational experiences often included performing public service. They prefer to work for companies that are involved with philanthropy and interactive social programs.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúMillennials have high expectations. They expect to do well in whatever career path they choose to follow, and they expect to be appreciated for their efforts.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Millennials get bored very quickly. Being hip is not enough; companies must stay cool to keep this up-and-coming workforce motivated. For example, identify new employees who show the most promise and go out of your way to make them feel appreciated. Let them know you value their contributions. Challenge them with new tasks, projects and responsibilities. Make sure your corporate culture supports new ideas and diverse perspectives so you can cultivate an innovative, creative atmosphere. The quickest way to lose your cool is to follow a process just because you‚Äôve always done it that way.</p><h3>Millennials at the Helm</h3><p>The millennials are inheriting an abundance of social and environmental global problems. Are they ready to assume leadership? The boomer generation‚Äôs job is to prepare these future leaders, but to teach millennials, boomers must acknowledge that they learn differently. Information has bombarded millennials since infancy, so they‚Äôve learned how to organize and manage data rather than learn by rote. They think and react with speed, and they communicate succinctly. They don‚Äôt have the attention span, or perhaps the tolerance, for boredom, that boomers have. When you are training millennials, try these approaches:</p><ul><li><strong>‚ÄúKeep it short‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì Think sound bite and summary rather than details. </li><li><strong>‚ÄúInclude hands-on experiences‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì These adults are not passive learners.</li><li><strong>‚ÄúDesign team-based learning‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì Millennials are comfortable collaborating.</li><li><strong>‚ÄúCreate a visual experience‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì This generation grew up using PowerPoint, video games and television.</li><li><strong>‚ÄúMake it real‚Äù</strong> ‚Äì Millennials absorb information better when they understand how it affects their world.</li></ul><h3>Talking the Talk</h3><p>Nothing defines a generation as clearly as its slang. Boomers who grew up using words that were foreign to their parents, such as ‚Äúcool,‚Äù ‚Äúdig it,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe fuzz,‚Äù find the millennials‚Äô slang just as incomprehensible. Mass media, advertising and technical jargon heavily influence the millennials‚Äô slang. Abbreviations abound; words such as ‚Äúdefriend‚Äù and ‚Äúporntastic‚Äù have worked their way into the daily vernacular. As masters of texting, millennials commonly replace phrases with acronyms, such as ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù (‚Äúlaugh out loud‚Äù), ‚ÄúGTG‚Äù (‚Äúgot to go‚Äù) and ‚ÄúTMI‚Äù (‚Äútoo much information‚Äù).</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe Boomers wanted and expected their children to do better than they did. To that end, they pushed, pulled, cobbled, encouraged, bribed and motivated their offspring to reach for the stars.‚Äù</blockquote><p>When marketing to millennials, be aware of how media-savvy they are. Their comfort and familiarity with every type of media has bred in them a healthy skepticism of anything slick, obviously manipulative or too good to believe. They‚Äôre immune to the daily barrage of mass media messages and place more trust in new media, such as the Internet and cellphones. The most effective media mix reaches them on their own turf by using interactive Web sites and YouTube videos to supplement print, TV and radio advertising.</p>
